1,Frustration-affirmation? Thwarted goals motivate compliance with social norms for violence and nonviolence,"When thwarted goals increase endorsement of violence, it may not always reflect antisocial tendencies or some breakdown of self-regulation per se; such responses can also reflect an active process of self-regulation, whose purpose is to comply with the norms of one’s social environment. In the present experiments (total N = 2,145), the causal link between thwarted goals and endorsement of violent means (guns and war) was found to be contingent on perceptions that violence is normatively valued. Experiments 1–3 establish that thwarted goals increase endorsement of violence primarily among U.S. adults of a lower educational background and/or men who endorse a masculine honor culture. Experiment 4 manipulates the perceived normative consensus of college educated Americans, and demonstrates that thwarted goals increase college educated Americans’ endorsement of whatever norm is salient: prowar or antiwar. Generalizing the model beyond violent means, Experiment 5 demonstrates that goal-thwarted Europeans report increased willingness to volunteer for refugee support activities if they perceive strong social norms to volunteer. Altogether, these findings support a frustration-affirmation model rather than frustration-aggression, whereby thwarted goals increase compliance with perceived norms for behavior, which can increase endorsement of violent means such as guns and war, but also nonviolent charitable actions.

2,Explaining social behavior in response to death-related threats: The conspecific loss compensation mechanism,"Exposure to death-related threats, thoughts and cues (actual or anticipated death of conspecifics, including oneself) remain powerful stressors across primate species, including humans. Accordingly, a pervasive issue in psychology pertains to the kind of social–cognitive responses exposure to deadly threats generates. To this day, psychological models of reactions to death-related threats remain underspecified, especially with regards to modern evolutionary theory. Research on both humans and nonhuman primates’ reactions to death-related threats highlights a general tendency of human and nonhuman primates to 'cling to the group' and to display increased social motivation in the face of death and deadly events (predator attacks, disasters, terror attacks. . .). Given the adaptive value of social networks, which provide individuals with resources, mating pool and support, we propose the existence of an evolved mechanism to explain these affiliative responses. In particular, we propose a 'conspecific loss compensation mechanism' ({CLCM}) that actively keeps track of and compensates for threats to the integrity of one’s social network. In the face of death-related cues signaling a danger for one’s social network, or actual conspecific loss, {CLCM} triggers proportional affiliative responses by a process labeled compensatory socialization. After reviewing existing evidence for the {CLCM}, we discuss its plausibility, parsimonious character, and explanatory power of the diversity of responses observed among threatened and grieving individuals. We also formulate clear and novel predictions to be tested in future research.

3,Focus theory of normative conduct and terror-management theory: The interactive impact of mortality salience and norm salience on social judgment,"Research on terror-management theory has shown that after mortality salience ({MS}) people attempt to live up to cultural values. But cultures often value very different and sometimes even contradictory standards, leading to difficulties in predicting behavior as a consequence of terror-management needs. The authors report 4 studies to demonstrate that the effect of {MS} on people's social judgments depends on the salience of norms. In Study 1, making salient opposite norms (prosocial vs. proself) led to reactions consistent with the activated norms following {MS} compared with the control condition. Study 2 showed that, in combination with a pacifism prime, {MS} increased pacifistic attitudes. In Study 3, making salient a conservatism/security prime led people to recommend harsher bonds for an illegal prostitute when they were reminded of death, whereas a benevolence prime counteracted this effect. In Study 4 a help prime, combined with {MS}, increased people's helpfulness. Discussion focuses briefly on how these findings inform both terror-management theory and the focus theory of normative conduct.

4,Trading in search of structure: Market relationships as a compensatory control tool,"Rooting our model in the compensatory control theory, we propose that one reason behind the prevalence of market relationships in modern society is that the fundamental need for orderliness makes them psychologically appealing because of the structure they provide. The initial study confirmed that market relationships are perceived as more structured than communal relationships. In 13 experiments (including 2 preregistered ones), we examined the causal relationship between personal control and preferences for market relationships. First, participants with a threatened sense of control preferred market over communal relationships and interpreted ambiguous social interactions as market-related. Second, the salience of market relationships triggered a sense of control and evoked internal explanations of various events. Finally, priming market relationships reduced the search for other compensatory control tools in the face of external threats. We also demonstrated that market relationships are appealing because of their structure, as perceiving ambiguous situations as market-related after threatening control was moderated by Personal Need for Structure, and the relation between market relationships and the sense of control was mediated by perceived structure. Finally, we tested boundary conditions of the above effects and provided evidence that people facing control threat tend to prefer market-oriented rules in relations with strangers rather than with those close to them, and that the relation between market relationships and sense of control is absent among securely attached individuals. We discuss why market relationships compensate for lack of control and refer to other disciplines to explain this phenomenon.

5,Long live A(me)rica! An examination of the interplay between nationalistic–symbolic immortality striving and belief in life after death,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) proposes that the awareness of our eventual death is at odds with our evolved desire to live and that humans attempt to resolve this psychological conflict by investing in cultural worldviews that grant symbolic or literal immortality. The present studies examine the interplay between symbolic and literal immortality striving. Three studies show that, following a death reminder, only individuals who did not have a route to literal immortality (belief in an afterlife) increased how long they believe their culture (Canada in Studies 1 and 2, the United States in Study 3), will last by thousands of years. Study 4 demonstrated that this moderation effect cannot be explained by general religiosity; Study 5 conceptually replicated this finding using a different measure of perceived cultural longevity. Finally, Study 6 demonstrates that for those who were highly invested in their nation but did not believe in an afterlife, perceived cultural longevity was associated with decreased death anxiety. These results are consistent with the notion that people possess a primary path to immortality that follows directly from their worldview. The need for increased specificity in study design in {TMT} and the threat and defense literature more broadly is discussed.

6,When death is compelling: Door-in-the-face compliance under mortality salience,"Research on terror management theory has found evidence that people under mortality salience strive to live up to activated social norms and values. Recently, research has shown that mortality salience also increases adherence to the norm of reciprocity. Based on this, in the current paper we investigated the idea that mortality salience influences persuasion strategies that are based on the norm of reciprocity. We therefore assume that mortality salience should enhance compliance for a request when using the door-in-the-face technique – a persuasion strategy grounded in the norm of reciprocity. In a hypothetical scenario (Study 1), and in a field experiment (Study 2), applying the door-in-the-face technique enhanced compliance in the mortality salience condition compared to a control group.

7,Destined to die but not to wage war: How existential threat can contribute to escalation or de-escalation of violent intergroup conflict,"War means threat to people’s lives. Research derived from terror management theory ({TMT}) illustrates that the awareness of death leads people to defend cultural ingroups and their worldviews to attain a sense of symbolic immortality and thereby buffer existential anxiety. This can result in hostile effects of mortality salience ({MS}), such as derogation of outgroup members, prejudice, stereotyping, aggression, and racism, which, in turn, can lead to the escalation of violent intergroup conflict and, thus, the escalation of war. Yet, escalation of destructive conflict following {MS} is not automatic. Instead, research on {TMT} suggests that {MS} does not necessarily result in conflict and intolerance but can also foster positive tendencies, such as intergroup fairness or approval of pacifism, depending on how existential threat is perceived, whether the need for symbolic self-transcendence is satisfied, which social norms are salient, and how social situations are interpreted. In the present article, we review current {TMT} research with the aim of reconciling the seemingly contradictory findings of hostile and peaceful reactions to reminders of death. We present a terror management model of escalation and de-escalation of violent intergroup conflicts, which takes into account the interaction between threat salience and features of the social situation. We also discuss possible intervention strategies to override detrimental consequences of existential threat and argue that war is not the inevitable consequence of threat.

8,Religion and reactance to {COVID}-19 mitigation guidelines,"During the current {COVID}-19 pandemic, religious gatherings have become intense hot spots for the spread of the virus. In this research, we focus on the religiosity of communities to examine whether religiosity helps or hinders adherence to mitigation policies such as shelter-in-place directives. Prior research has made opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies, whereas another has predicted lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasiexperiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people’s movements. However, when the directive was imposed, higher religiosity resulted in less adherence to shelter-in-place directives.

9,Youth extremism as a response to global threats? A threat-regulation perspective on violent extremism among the youth,"Violent extremism is rising across the globe as indicated by the growing number of attacks of terrorist organizations. It is known that violent extremism is carried out mainly by young people due to developmental and external factors. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that ideologically motivated violence stems from threat-regulation processes aiming to restore significance, control, and certainty. Nevertheless, few studies from the threat-regulation literature have focused on youth samples and on the social-economic and political context in which radicalization processes occur. Here, we hypothesize that one driver of the surge in violent extremism might be globalization. To do so, we review the evidence that shows that globalization increases the perception of affiliative, economic, and existential threats. In return, some studies suggest that these kinds of threats promote violent extremism among youth samples. Therefore, we conclude that the threatening context generated by four decades of globalization might be a risk factor for youth extremism in the long run.

10,Does social psychology persist over half a century? A direct replication of Cialdini et al’s (1975) classic door-in-the-face technique,"Many failed replications in social psychology have cast doubt on the validity of the field. Most of these replication attempts have focused on findings published from the 1990s on, ignoring a large body of older literature. As some scholars suggest that social psychological findings and theories are limited to a particular time, place, and population, we sought to test whether a classical social psychological finding that was published nearly half a century ago can be successfully replicated in another country on another continent. To this end, we directly replicated Cialdini et al.’s (1975) door-in-the-face ({DITF}) technique according to which people’s likelihood to comply with a target request increases after having turned down a larger request. Thereby, we put the reciprocal concessions theory—the original process explanation of the {DITF} technique—to a critical test. Overall, compliance rates in our replication were similarly high as those Cialdini et al. (1975) found 45 years ago. That is, participants were more likely to comply with a target request after turning down an extreme request than participants who were exposed to the target request only or to a similarly small request before being exposed to the target request. These findings support the idea that reciprocity norms play a crucial role in {DITF} strategies. Moreover, the results suggest that at least some social psychological findings can transcend a particular time, place, and population. Further theoretical implications are discussed.

11,Personality and prosocial behavior: A theoretical framework and meta-analysis,"Decades of research document individual differences in prosocial behavior using controlled experiments that model social interactions in situations of interdependence. However, theoretical and empirical integration of the vast literature on the predictive validity of personality traits to account for these individual differences is missing. Here, we present a theoretical framework that identifies 4 broad situational affordances across interdependent situations (i.e., exploitation, reciprocity, temporal conflict, and dependence under uncertainty) and more specific subaffordances within certain types of interdependent situations (e.g., possibility to increase equality in outcomes) that can determine when, which, and how personality traits should be expressed in prosocial behavior. To test this framework, we meta-analyzed 770 studies reporting on 3,523 effects of 8 broad and 43 narrow personality traits on prosocial behavior in interdependent situations modeled in 6 commonly studied economic games (Dictator Game, Ultimatum Game, Trust Game, Prisoner’s Dilemma, Public Goods Game, and Commons Dilemma). Overall, meta-analytic correlations ranged between −.18 ≤ ρ̂ ≤ .26, and most traits yielding a significant relation to prosocial behavior had conceptual links to the affordances provided in interdependent situations, most prominently the possibility for exploitation. Moreover, for several traits, correlations within games followed the predicted pattern derived from a theoretical analysis of affordances. On the level of traits, we found that narrow and broad traits alike can account for prosocial behavior, informing the bandwidth-fidelity problem. In sum, the meta-analysis provides a theoretical foundation that can guide future research on prosocial behavior and advance our understanding of individual differences in human prosociality.

12,Religious residue: Cross-cultural evidence that religious psychology and behavior persist following deidentification,"More than 1 billion people worldwide report no religious affiliation. These religious 'nones' represent the world’s third largest religion-related identity group and are a diverse group, with some having previous religious identification and others never identifying as religious. We examined how 3 forms of religious identification—current, former, and never—influence a range of cognitions, emotions, and behavior. Three studies using nationally representative samples of religious Western (United States), secular Western (Netherlands, New Zealand) and Eastern (Hong Kong) cultures showed evidence of a religious residue effect: Formerly religious individuals (i.e., religious 'dones') differed from never religious and currently religious individuals in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. Study 1 (n = 3,071) offered initial cross-cultural evidence, which was extended in a preregistered replication study that also included measures of charitable contribution (Study 2; n = 1,626). Study 3 (N = 31,604) found that individuals who deidentified were still relatively likely to engage in prosocial behavior (e.g., volunteering) after leaving religion. This research has broad implications for understanding changing global trends in religious identification and their consequences for psychology and behavior.

13,Follow the norm! Terror management theory and the influence of descriptive norms,"Terror management research shows that mortality salience ({MS}) increases people’s attempts to live up to cultural standards. However, as cultures value very different and sometimes even contradictory standards, it is often difficult to derive specific predictions. Previous research identified the salience of injunctive norms (norms based on moral prescriptions) as an important moderator. We tested whether the influence of {MS} also depended on the salience of descriptive norms, which refer to what most people actually do in a particular situation. We, indeed, found that only when showing people that fellow ingroup members were optimistic (as opposed to pessimistic) that Germany would win the soccer world championship, did {MS} increase participants’ tendency to likewise express optimism about the team.

14,"Fundamentalism as dogmatic belief, moral rigorism, and strong groupness across cultures: Dimensionality, underlying components, and related interreligious prejudice","Is fundamentalism universal across religious cultures? We investigated this issue by focusing on 3 questions: (a) the dimensionality of fundamentalism, as measured by the Religious Fundamentalism Scale (Altemeyer \& Hunsberger, 2004); (b) the very nature of fundamentalism as denoting dogmatic belief, moral rigorism, or strong groupness; and (c) interreligious prejudice as predicted uniquely, additively, or interactively by religiousness and sociocognitive rigidity. We collected data from 14 countries of Catholic, Protestant, Christian Orthodox, Buddhist, Jewish, and Muslim tradition, regrouped in 7 cultural-religious zones (N = 3,218 young adults). We measured fundamentalism, the 4 dimensions of religiousness (believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging), authoritarianism, existential quest, and interreligious prejudice—negative and discriminatory attitudes toward various religious outgroups and atheists. Across religious cultures, we found that: (a) the scale is unidimensional; (b) fundamentalism is best conceptualized as a combination of dogmatic belief (believing and low existential quest) and moral rigorism (behaving and authoritarianism) and occasionally as strong groupness (belonging and authoritarianism); (c) religious dimensions, additively to and interactively with, authoritarianism and low existential quest predict interreligious prejudice (in monotheistic cultures); and (d) anti-Muslim attitudes were the highest, but fundamentalism and religiousness related most strongly to antiatheist sentiments.

15,A Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action ({SIMPEA}),"Large-scale environmental crises are genuinely collective phenomena: they usually result from collective, rather than personal, behavior and how they are cognitively represented and appraised is determined by collectively shared interpretations (e.g., differing across ideological groups) and based on concern for collectives (e.g., humankind, future generations) rather than for individuals. Nevertheless, pro-environmental action has been primarily investigated as a personal decision-making process. We complement this research with a social identity perspective on pro-environmental action. Social identity is the human capacity to define the self in terms of 'We' instead of 'I,' enabling people to think and act as collectives, which should be crucial given personal insufficiency to appraise and effectively respond to environmental crises. We propose a Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action ({SIMPEA}) of how social identity processes affect both appraisal of and behavioral responses to large-scale environmental crises. We review related and pertinent research providing initial evidence for the role of 4 social identity processes hypothesized in {SIMPEA}. Specifically, we propose that ingroup identification, ingroup norms and goals, and collective efficacy determine environmental appraisals as well as both private and public sphere environmental action. These processes are driven by personal and collective emotions and motivations that arise from environmental appraisal and operate on both a deliberate and automatic processing level. Finally, we discuss {SIMPEA}’s implications for the research agenda in environmental and social psychology and for interventions fostering pro-environmental action.

16,The role of religious fundamentalism and tightness-looseness in promoting collective narcissism and extreme group behavior,"The present study aims to understand the roles of religious fundamentalism and collective narcissism in predicting extreme behavior. It was hypothesized that religious fundamentalism may enhance collective narcissism and that this would in turn increase the tendency to endorse extreme behavior. It was also anticipated that perceptions of social tightness would moderate the indirect effect of religious fundamentalism on extreme behavior through collective narcissism. To test the hypotheses, we collected data from 787 members of Islamic religious groups in Indonesia (male = 457, female = 325); ages ranged from 17 to 52 (M = 25.14, {SD} = 8.49). Supporting the hypotheses, our findings demonstrated the validity of the expected pathways, confirming that it is important to consider the role of collective narcissism and tightness-looseness when studying relationships between religious fundamentalism and extreme behavior. Our findings demonstrate that when religious fundamentalists are able to see their cultural values in a loose way or more dynamics, they may become less narcissistic collective and less support for extreme behaviors.

17,"The {COVID}-19 pandemic, authoritarianism, and rejection of sexual dissenters in Poland","In Poland, both, gender hierarchy restricting women’s sexuality and heteronormativity are rooted in traditional 'family values' supported by the teachings of the Polish Catholic Church and attached to Polish national identity. Dissenters to traditional norms regulating gender and sexual relations are rejected as a threat to social order and national unity. Latent growth curve modeling performed on data from a 3-wave longitudinal study indicated linear, interrelated increases in authoritarianism; a desire for national cohesion; and rejection of sexual dissenters in the nationally representative sample of Polish participants (N = 889) as the novel coronavirus ({COVID}-19) pandemic unfolded in Poland. Data were collected before and during the outbreak of the pandemic allowing us to link the changes in social attitudes to this naturally occurring threat. Cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that authoritarianism predicted desire for national cohesion, which resulted in rejection of dissenters. These results are in line with theoretical models of authoritarianism as a response to threat. They are also in line with findings linking death anxiety and the threat of infectious disease to increases in authoritarianism, traditional worldview defense, in-group cohesion and sexual restrictiveness.

18,In the valley of the shadow of death: The existential benefits of imbuing life and death with meaning,"Religions have long offered existential security by making life meaningful and psychologically solving the problem of death. However, the mechanisms involved in such terror management processes have yet to be fully explored. In three studies, we examined how a meaningful life and a meaningful death serve the terror management function of managing the cognitive accessibility of death-related thoughts. Study 1 revealed that prompts that enhance the meaningfulness of life and death elicited greater religious/spiritual themes, which may provide some with the existential comfort of literal immortality. Study 2 revealed that imagining a meaningful life and death reduced the accessibility of death-related cognitions. In Study 3, we experimentally disambiguated meaning in life and death and found that imagining the combination of both living a meaningful life and preserving meaning beyond death attenuate death-thought accessibility. Given that religions offer adherents ways to find meaning in this life as well as preserve such meaning after death, implications for the psychology of religion are discussed.

19,Qualitative methods advancing research into the expression and experience of stigma in childhood and adolescence,"While research efforts are growing to understand stigmatizing responses to mental and physical health conditions, much of this work has focused on adults. Consequently, less is known about how such stigma is expressed or experienced in childhood and adolescence. This article argues that qualitative methods are particularly suited to work with young study participants to afford them the opportunity to express their views or share their experiences using flexible and creative means that encourage and facilitate meaningful involvement. Such methods, on their own or as part of a mixed-method design, have a wide application in research from exploratory work in generating a knowledge base and building theory to developing and evaluating interventions. As such, qualitative enquiry is in keeping with child-centered, participatory philosophies, as well as being pragmatically and scientifically valuable to the study of mental and physical health-related stigma in childhood.

20,The effect of mortality salience on bodily scanning behaviors in anxiety-related disorders,"Accumulated empirical evidence suggests that death anxiety is strongly associated with multiple mental health conditions. Despite this, few studies have experimentally explored whether manipulating reminders of death could influence the symptoms of mental illnesses. The present, preregistered study used a mortality salience design to assess whether death reminders could increase anxious behavior (i.e., time spent scanning one’s body, identification with images consistent with poorer health, and intention to visit a medical practitioner) among individuals with relevant disorders. A total of 128 treatment-seeking participants with either a body scanning disorder (i.e., panic disorder, illness anxiety, or somatic symptom disorder) or a nonscanning disorder (i.e., depression) were randomly allocated to either a mortality salience or control condition. Following this, participants were presented with a series of images of various body parts, which purportedly predicted particular life outcomes, and asked to check their own body and select the image that most closely matched their own. As hypothesized, the results revealed that mortality salience produced an overall increase in all three anxiety-related behaviors. Further, mortality salience selectively increased scanning duration and identification with images indicating poorer health for individuals with a scanning disorder. This effect only occurred when participants were told the body part predicted a health-relevant outcome. In contrast, mortality salience increased intention to visit a medical specialist regardless of one’s disorder. The findings support theoretical predictions that death anxiety may have a causal role in multiple mental disorders.

21,Social context moderates the effects of quest for significance on violent extremism,"Quest for significance theory (Kruglanski et al., 2013; Kruglanski, Jasko, Chernikova, Dugas, \& Webber 2017) states that extreme behavior for an ideological cause is more likely under psychological conditions that induce a search for significance and social recognition. Two forms of motivation for significance have been identified; the quest for individual significance rooted in personal experiences and the quest for collective significance rooted in the perception that one’s social group is humiliated and/or disrespected. Whereas past research has demonstrated associations between both forms of quest for significance and political extremism, there is little understanding of the conditions that moderate those effects. In the present study, we tested the moderating role of belonging to radical versus nonradical social context. Four studies were conducted in three different cultural settings: Sri Lanka (Study 1, n = 335), Morocco (Study 2, n = 260), and Indonesia (Study 3, n = 379 and Study 4, n = 334). Each study compared the responses from participants residing in social contexts that were more or less radical. Radical social contexts were identified based either on participants’ belonging to known extremist organizations (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or residence within a locale that is a known hotbed for recruitment into terrorist organizations (Study 2). Across studies, we found evidence that radical social contexts strengthen the link between quest for significance—particularly collective significance—and support for political violence.

22,Extensions of the proteus effect on intergroup aggression in the real world,"Video game depictions of racial minorities are often stereotyped and likely to activate aggressive schema and behaviors. Using the theoretical framework of Proteus Effect, we manipulated the avatar race (White or Black) of main and enemy characters in a video game as well as the race of a partner in an aggressive behavior task. This allows for a more complete test of how mediated intergroup aggression translates to behavior in the real world. For White participants, a significant 3-way interaction between the race of the main character, enemy character, and real-world partner emerged. Specifically, participants were more aggressive toward White partners in intergroup conditions compared to same-race conditions. A similar pattern of results was found for motivations to harm the real-world partner. We discuss the possibility that violent intergroup scenarios in video games may influence aggression in some real-world situations.

23,Mortality salience and uncertainty threat among younger vs older adults,"How do older versus younger individuals respond differently to existential threats? Although age brings emotional benefits that promote greater meaningfulness, it remains unclear how age influences reminders of death. Both terror management theory ({TMT}) and alternative frameworks (uncertainty management model – {UMM}, the meaning-making model – {MMM}) posit that individuals respond defensively to threat, but most of such studies focused on college-aged populations. Several {TMT} studies across the lifespan reached equivocal findings, and to our knowledge, no experiments have tested {UMM}/{MMM} across age groups. We tested how existential threats (i.e., mortality, uncertainty) predict defensive psychological distancing in younger/older adults. We found that older, but not younger, adults showed less defensiveness after existential threat.

24,The malleable morality of conspicuous consumption,"Conspicuous consumption has often been decried as immoral by many philosophers and scholars, yet it is ubiquitous and widely embraced. This research sheds light on the apparent paradox by proposing that the perceived morality of conspicuous consumption is malleable, contingent upon how different moral lenses highlight the different characteristics embedded in the behavior. Utilizing the Moral Foundations Theory, we demonstrate that the individualizing values (i.e., equality and welfare) make people focus on the self-enhancing characteristics of conspicuous consumption, making it seem morally objectionable. However, the binding values (i.e., deference to authority, in-group loyalty, and purity) make people focus on the social identity signaling characteristic of conspicuous consumption, making it seem morally permissible. First, an archival dataset shows that the prevalence of the different moral values predicts per-capita spending on luxury goods across different countries. Then, 6 studies (N = 2903) show that the trait endorsement and the momentary salience of the different moral foundations can influence the moral judgment of conspicuous consumption as well as the propensity to engage in conspicuous consumption. Further, analyses show that the effect of the binding values (individualizing values) is mediated by heightened sensitivity to the social identity signaling (self-enhancing) aspects of conspicuous consumption. Finally, the studies demonstrate that the effect is moderated by the extent of social visibility during consumption. Thus, this research suggests that some moral values can, somewhat paradoxically, increase conspicuous consumption.

We conducted an experience sampling method study using employees from an information technology firm in China when {COVID}-19 was surging there and two experiments using employees from a variety of industries in the United States when it became a new epicenter of the global outbreak. Results from 3 studies largely supported our theoretical hypotheses. Specifically, our research showed that mortality salience concerning {COVID}-19 was positively related to employees’ state anxiety (general anxiety in Study 1 and Study 2 and death-specific anxiety in Study 3). Our studies also found that servant leadership is particularly crucial in guiding employees with state anxiety associated with {COVID}-19 mortality salience to be engaged in their jobs and to contribute more to the broader community. Our findings offer timely, valuable implications for theory and practice. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Hu, Jia and He, Wei and Zhou, Kong",0,,25
26,Moral foundations and political orientation: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"We investigate the relationship of morality and political orientation by focusing on the influential results showing that liberals and conservatives rely on different moral foundations. We conducted a comprehensive literature search from major databases and other sources for primary studies that used the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and a typical measure of political orientation, a political self-placement item. We used a predefined process for independent extraction of effect sizes by two authors and ran both study-level and individual-level analyses. With 89 samples, 605 effect sizes, and 33,804 independent participants, in addition to 192,870 participants from the widely used {YourMorals}.org website, the basic differences about conservatives and liberals are supported. Yet, heterogeneity is moderate, and the results may be less generalizable across samples and political cultures than previously thought. The effect sizes obtained from the {YourMorals}.org data appear inflated compared with independent samples, which is partly related to political interest and may be because of self-selection. The association of moral foundations to political orientation varies culturally (between regions and countries) and subculturally (between White and Black respondents and in response to political interest). The associations also differ depending on the choice of the social or economic dimension and its labeling, supporting both the bidimensional model of political orientation and the findings that the dimensions are often strongly correlated. Our findings have implications for interpreting published studies, as well as designing new ones where the political aspect of morality is relevant. The results are primarily limited by the validity of the measures and the homogeneity of the included studies in terms of sample origins.

27,To die for a cause but not for a companion: Attachment-related variations in the terror management function of self-sacrifice,"In 8 studies, we examined the terror management function of self-sacrifice and the moderating role of attachment orientations. Studies 1–5 focused on readiness to self-sacrifice for a cause, whereas Studies 6–8 focused on self-sacrifice to save a relationship partner’s life. In Studies 1–3 and 6, we examined whether mortality salience increases readiness to self-sacrifice. In Studies 4–5 and 7–8, we examined the defensive nature and anxiety-buffering role of self-sacrifice—that is, whether providing another terror management defense reduces the readiness to self-sacrifice following mortality salience and whether thoughts about self-sacrifice mitigate death-thought accessibility. Findings indicated that self-sacrifice for a cause served a terror management function mainly among attachment-anxious participants, whereas self-sacrifice for a relationship partner served this defensive function mainly among participants scoring low on avoidant attachment. Attachment-avoidant participants reacted to mortality salience with reluctance to self-sacrifice for another person. Discussion focuses on attachment orientation as a basis for using self-sacrifice as an existential defense.

28,Mortality salience and its effects on peace processes: A review,"The present paper offers a review of the relationship between existential individual threats and peace-hampering as well as peace-facilitating factors. An overwhelming bulk of literature on terror management theory ({TMT}) demonstrates negative effects of mortality salience such as derogation of outgroup members, prejudice, stereotyping, aggression, and racism. These negative reactions may be detrimental in peace-processes and critical in explaining intergroup conflicts, severe hostilities, and war. Complementary empirical insights derived from {TMT}, however, demonstrate positive effects of mortality salience ({MS}) that lead to prosocial reactions. The findings that are reviewed throughout this paper aim at reconciling the seemingly contradictory findings of antisocial and prosocial reactions to reminders of death. In concluding, a variety of conceivable interventions are discussed that may override genuinely detrimental consequences of {MS} and help to foster peace processes.

29,Effect of mortality salience on charitable donations: Evidence from a national sample,"Mortality salience refers to being reminded of death, which increases self-reported prosociality in student samples. Here, we examined effects of mortality salience on actual donations, in a national life-span sample (N = 5,376). In the mortality-salience (vs. control) condition, participants donated on average 25 cents more to charity, out of their \$5 budget. This finding was unaffected by adult age or charity type, suggesting its generalizability. However, older adults donated more than younger adults. Auxiliary analyses suggested that fear of death was likely not the main mechanism underlying our findings. We discuss implications for literatures on mortality salience, aging, and charitable giving.

30,"Reducing defensive responses to thoughts of death: Meditation, mindfulness, and Buddhism","Three studies investigated the effects of meditation on responses to reminders of death. Study 1 took a quasi-experimental approach, comparing defensive responses to mortality salience ({MS}) of South Korean participants with varying levels of experience with Buddhism and meditation. Whereas non-Buddhists without meditation showed the typical increase in worldview defense after mortality salience ({MS}), this effect was not found among non-Buddhists immediately after an initial meditation experience, nor among lay Buddhists who meditated regularly or Buddhist monks with intensive meditation experience. Study 2, a fully randomized experiment, showed that {MS} increased worldview defense among South Koreans at a meditation training who were assessed before meditating but not among participants assessed after their first meditation experience. Study 3 showed that whereas American students without prior meditation experience showed increased worldview defense and suppression of death-related thoughts after {MS}, these effects were eliminated immediately after an initial meditation experience. Death thought accessibility mediated the effect of {MS} on worldview defense without meditation, but meditation eliminated this mediation.

31,The Assessment of Spirituality and Religious Sentiments ({ASPIRES}) scale: Examining a spiritual transcendence nomological net in Polish context,"The Assessment of Spirituality and Religious Sentiments ({ASPIRES}) scale assesses religiousness and spirituality (R/S) as universal psychological constructs. The current study presents replication of spirituality assessment as proposed by the {ASPIRES} model and examination of relationships among religiousness, spirituality, agency, communion and materialism in the Polish cultural context. Using multiple samples and methods (total N = 1,797), the factor structure, reliability, cross-observer convergence, metric equivalence, and incremental validity of the {ASPIRES} scales over personality were examined. The results confirmed the psychometric, interpretive, and predictive utility of the {ASPIRES} in non-Western, culturally homogenous cultural context. Moreover, the pattern of correlations among religiosity, spirituality, agency, communion, and materialism indicated distinctiveness between religiosity and spirituality. The value of a universal measure of R/S constructs for the psychology of religion was discussed.

32,Religious magnanimity: Reminding people of their religious belief system reduces hostility after threat,"The present research tested the hypothesis that many people’s ambient religious beliefs are non-hostile and magnanimous by assessing whether reminding people of their religious belief systems would reduce hostility after threat. Across religious affiliations, participants reported that their religious belief systems encourage magnanimous behavior. In addition, priming their religious belief systems caused them to act more magnanimously, but only when motivated to adhere to salient ideals (i.e., after threats; see Gailliot, Stillman, Schmeichel, Maner, \& Plant, 2008; Jonas et al., 2008). Specifically, in Studies 1–5, we found that a general religious belief system prime ('Which religious belief system do you identify with?') reduced the hostility of people’s thoughts, behaviors, and judgments following threat. In Studies 6 and 7, we found that the religious belief system prime only reduced hostile reactions to threat among participants who held religious beliefs that oriented them toward magnanimous ideals (Study 6) and who were dispositionally inclined to adhere to their ideals (Study 7). In Study 8, we found support for the role of magnanimous ideals by demonstrating that directly priming these ideals yielded effects similar to those produced by a religious belief system prime. These studies provide consistent evidence that, by invoking magnanimous ideals, a religious belief system prime promotes less hostile responses to threat.

33,How Americans feel about guns after mass shootings: The case of the 2016 Orlando nightclub massacre,"Objective: At the time, the 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, was the most devastating mass shooting in the United States, with 49 people dead and dozens more injured. We examined American attitudes about gun legislation in its aftermath, paying particular attention to the importance of media exposure to the event. Method: Starting 5 days after the shooting, data were collected anonymously among a nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 3,199); 95\% completed the survey online. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models. Results: Most respondents favored gun restrictions in the aftermath of the shootings (i.e., 80\%, weighted, favored universal background checks; 61\%, weighted, desired stricter laws covering the sale of firearms). Multinomial logistic regressions identified traditional (Republican identity, gun ownership, age, gender, education) and novel (media exposure, recent history of violence) predictors of gun attitudes. Individuals who consumed a minimum of 1 hr average daily media coverage in the event’s aftermath were significantly more likely to prefer stricter gun laws and favor universal background checks (p {\textless} .05) than those who consumed less than 1 hr, adjusting for relevant covariates. Direct exposure to the shooting was not significantly associated with gun attitudes. Conclusion: Media coverage of mass shootings may be critical in shaping contemporary public attitudes around gun violence. Research on gun violence should therefore include information on media exposure and explore whether mass shooting media coverage can shift individual attitudes toward preventive policy efforts.

34,The stress bias in mental health reporting: Death anxiety biases mental health self-assessments amongst deployed soldiers,"This study examined whether posing questions that create a stress state in respondents biases subsequent reporting of mental health ({MH}) symptomology. For instance, questions related to trauma exposure may activate thoughts about death (facing it, surviving it, being afraid of it), and these death anxieties can influence assessments of one’s health and thus bias self-reports of {MH} measured in the same questionnaire context. A controlled randomized experiment was conducted as part of a longitudinal study of U.S. Army soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan between April 2013 and January 2014. Anonymous surveys administered middeployment (n = 464) included self-report {MH} screening instruments for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. Combat exposures ({CEs}) were primed by randomly presenting the {CE} questions before or after {MH} instruments. The order of the measures significantly influenced reports of {MH} symptoms, and this stress bias is explained by differences in death anxiety. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that the well-documented relationship between the intensity of {CEs} and each {MH} screener severity score was significant when the {CEs} were primed but not vice versa (index of moderated mediation: for {PTSD}, 95\% {CI} [.0000, .0216]; for depression, 95\% {CI} [.0000, .0216]; and for generalized anxiety disorder, 95\% {CI} [.0005, .0170]), and that death anxiety mediated these relationships. Health care providers and psychological researchers who use standardized, nonrandomized, clinical screening instruments should be aware of this stress bias: Asking respondents to report a potentially traumatic exposure can bias the self-reporting of {MH} symptomatology.

35,Structure-seeking as a psychological antecedent of beliefs about morality,"People differ in their beliefs about the objectivity of moral claims. We investigated a possible psychological antecedent that might be associated with people’s beliefs about the objectivity of moral claims. More specifically, we examined the relationship between the endorsement of moral objectivism and one’s need to see the world as structured, ordered, and predictable. By believing that the world comprises objective facts about morality, a simple, rigid, and unambiguous structure is imposed on the moral landscape that is invariant to the whims and preferences of any particular person or group. Our results suggest that those more in need of personal structure and order in their lives are indeed more likely to endorse moral objectivism. We discuss the implications of these results for psychological theories of control and structure-seeking, and for cooperation, prosociality, social orderliness, and social goal pursuit.

36,A curvilinear relationship between clear beliefs about God and self-concept clarity,"The purpose of this work was to examine whether people’s beliefs about God are related to self-concept clarity ({SCC}) in a U-shaped fashion, such that those with the clearest (or strongest) beliefs about God would have greater {SCC} than those with relatively unclear beliefs about God. We found this pattern across three studies assessing specific Christian beliefs about God (Study 1), beliefs about God that are not specific to any religion (Study 2), and beliefs about God (or gods) as an explanation for reality (Study 3). The relationship was not explained by personal or utilitarian relevance of religious beliefs (Study 1), the importance of God-beliefs (Studies 2–3), or self-esteem (Study 3). This U-shaped pattern with {SCC} was not present with beliefs associated about government (Study 2) or science (Study 3), even though they serve some of the same psychological functions as God-beliefs. Thus, clear beliefs about God have a relatively distinct relationship with {SCC}.

37,Generosity and cooperation across the life span: A lab-in-the-field study,"Understanding persistence and changes in prosociality across the life span is fundamental to inform theory and practice. As life expectancy increases and pressing societal challenges demand increasing generosity and cooperation among individuals, it is crucial to understand intergenerational interactions. We present the findings from a novel lab-in-the-field experiment (N = 359, 18–90 years) that examines generosity and cooperation between generations. Our methodological approach allows us to study the effect of age on prosocial behavior as a function of the age of an unknown partner. We ask participants to make several decisions, and to state their expectations for their partners’ behavior, in a dictator game and a prisoner’s dilemma game with real monetary outcomes. The dictator game serves as a measure of generosity, whereas the prisoner’s dilemma serves as a measure of cooperation. We find that individuals used age as key information to condition behavior. Generosity was greater among older adults in response to young and older relative to middle-aged partners. Among younger adults, cooperation was greater in response to middle-aged and older partners relative to their own age cohort. All age groups expect less cooperation from young partners than from older and middle-aged partners. However, relative to young adults, older adults are more cooperative with young partners. Our study has crucial implications for the understanding of human generosity and cooperation across the life span.

38,On the relation of boredom and sadistic aggression,"What gives rise to sadism? While sadistic behavior (i.e., harming others for pleasure) is well-documented, past empirical research is nearly silent regarding the psychological factors behind it. We help close this gap by suggesting that boredom plays a crucial role in the emergence of sadistic tendencies. Across 9 diverse studies, we provide correlational and experimental evidence for a link between boredom and sadism. We demonstrate that sadistic tendencies are more pronounced among people who report chronic proneness to boredom in everyday life (Studies 1A-1F, N = 1,780). We then document that this relationship generalizes across a variety of important societal contexts, including online trolling; sadism in the military; sadistic behavior among parents; and sadistic fantasies (Studies 2–5, N = 1,740). Finally, we manipulate boredom experimentally and show that inducing boredom increases sadistic behavior (i.e., killing worms; destroying other participants’ pay; Studies 6–9, N = 4,097). However, alternatives matter: When several behavioral alternatives are available, boredom only motivates sadistic behavior among individuals with high dispositional sadism (Study 7). Conversely, when there is no alternative, boredom increases sadistic behavior across the board, even among individuals low in dispositional sadism (Studies 8 and 9). We further show that excitement and novelty seeking mediate the effects of boredom, and that boredom not only promotes sadistic (proactive) aggression, but reactive aggression as well (Study 9). Overall, the present work contributes to a better understanding of sadism and highlights the destructive potential of boredom. We discuss implications for basic research on sadism and boredom, as well as applied implications for society at large.

Areas of contention include (a) the distinction between religious belief and other influences, mainly the socialization effects of group behavior; (b) whether behavior largely restricted to the ingroup is genuine prosociality; (c) methodological issues such as the validity of self-report and peer-reported data and effects of social desirability; (d) the often paradoxical relationships with different forms of religiosity; and (e) potential curvilinear effects.

40,Human 'resources'? Objectification at work,"People behave differently when at work than not at work; for example, they are less interested in making close friends and use more transactional language (networking vs. socializing). These examples hint at a broader phenomenon: that people engage in more objectification—treating people akin to objects—in work contexts than non work contexts. We propose that objectification is more prevalent at work because people engage in more calculative and strategic thinking (i.e., making decisions by computing the costs and benefits). Seven studies (N = 2,712) test this. In Study 1, participants objectified the same individuals more when they were pictured at work (e.g., in an office) than not at work (e.g., in a coffee shop). In Study 2, there was more objectification when the same event was framed as more (vs. less) work-related. Studies 3a and 3b (experience-sampling studies with 2,300 data points) show that working adults objectify others more during work than non work interactions and demonstrate which situational characteristics enhance objectification. Study 4 manipulates the proposed mechanism: Participants nudged to think less calculatively and strategically showed a reduced tendency to objectify others in work contexts. Considering consequences, job applicants in Study 5 who read company mission statements containing more calculative language expected more objectification and were less interested in applying. Moreover, employees who perceived more objectification in their workplace reported more negative work experiences (e.g., feeling lower belonging, experiencing more incivility; Study 6). Together, these studies provide insight into how objectification arises, where it occurs, and its consequences.

41,Reasoning supports utilitarian resolutions to moral dilemmas across diverse measures,"Sacrificial moral dilemmas elicit a strong conflict between the motive to not personally harm someone and the competing motive to achieving the greater good, which is often described as the 'utilitarian' response. Some prior research suggests that reasoning abilities and deliberative cognitive style are associated with endorsement of utilitarian solutions, but, as has more recently been emphasized, both conceptual and methodological issues leave open the possibility that utilitarian responses are due instead to a reduced emotional response to harm. Across 8 studies, using self-report, behavioral performance, and neuroanatomical measures, we show that individual differences in reasoning ability and cognitive style of thinking are positively associated with a preference for utilitarian solutions, but bear no relationship to harm-relevant concerns. These findings support the dual-process model of moral decision making and highlight the utility of process dissociation methods.

42,"Anxiety buffer disruption: Worldview threat, death thought accessibility, and worldview defense among low and high posttraumatic stress symptom samples","Objective: Decades of research suggest that people are able to function effectively in the world and maintain mental health and well-being, at least in part, by relying on effective sociocultural anxiety buffer systems to shield against the awareness of death. However, according to anxiety buffer disruption theory, posttraumatic stress reflects anxiety buffer disruption, signaling that sociocultural belief systems have been rendered unable to buffer the individual against death awareness. As such, we would not expect to see the normal responses to death awareness meant to bolster and defend those belief systems in participants with posttraumatic stress. Method: To test these hypotheses, we screened for posttraumatic stress in U.S. participants (n = 4,150) and recruited individuals with low (n = 193) and high (n = 205) posttraumatic stress symptoms. Each group was randomly assigned to a worldview-threat or -support condition, followed by a standardized measure of death-thought accessibility ({DTA}) and worldview defense. Results: In the nonthreat (worldview-support) condition, individuals with high (vs. low) posttraumatic stress had elevated {DTA}. Further, among individuals with low posttraumatic stress, worldview threat (vs. -support) increased {DTA}, which in turn mediated an increase in worldview defense; however, among those with high posttraumatic stress, worldview threat did not increase {DTA} and its effect on worldview defense was substantially reduced. Conclusion: These findings supported the present hypotheses derived from anxiety buffer disruption theory, are important for understanding the existential dimension of posttraumatic stress, and may have implications for mental health.

43,Ethos of conflict as the prism to evaluate the Northern Irish and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts by the involved societies: A comparative analysis,"The present study compared participants’ evaluations of their own conflict with their evaluation of another conflict. These evaluations were examined through the prism of the ideological ethos of conflict ({EOC}), which was seen as the major contributing factor in the development of the biased perceptions, divergent understandings, and emotional responses previously observed among groups in conflict. The participants in the study were students: Protestants and Catholics from Northern Ireland, Jews and Palestinians from Israel, and an additional group of Swiss students. They were presented with four scenarios: Two scenarios presented separately the views of Catholics and Protestants about the conflict in Northern Ireland and two presented the views of Jews and Palestinians about the conflict in the Middle East. They were followed by a questionnaire that assessed emotional responses, attributions, and conflict assessment. Participants demonstrated greater bias when evaluating their own conflict than the other one, as a function of their level of adherence to the ethos of their conflict. The results showed consistently, and without exception, that individual’s ratings of their own conflict were significantly associated with their level of {EOC}’s acceptance as an ideology, but responses to another conflict were not. They imply that the {EOC} serves as a lens that is used to judge one’s own conflict in a biased way.

44,Violent values: Exploring the relationship between human values and violent attitudes,"This article explores the relationship between basic human values and different subdimensions of violent attitudes: attitudes to war, penal, child-rearing, and masculine violence. Examining a sample of university students in Sweden, the article confirms previous research’s finding that the security value is the principal predictor of positive attitudes toward war violence and penal violence. The results also show that attitudes toward violent child-rearing and masculine violence are correlated with the values of tradition and conformity but are not at all related to the security value. Previous findings on the primacy of the power value as a predictor of violent attitudes are also shown to be highly dependent on gender, with power predicting violent attitudes primarily for males. The findings indicate that the 4 dimensions of violent attitudes identified stem from different psychological motivations rather than one specific psychological motivation or value. Accordingly, the article proposes that the many different forms of violent attitudes need to be studied as separate categories.

45,Reactions to imposed political change: A prospective experimental investigation of Jewish settlers’ resistance to state contraction,"The implementation of a peace agreement between adversarial parties often carries a price, such as the imposition of political change on a population that opposes the peace agreement. The current research uses a resistance to change perspective and focuses on Jewish settlers in the West Bank as a case example of reactions to potential imposed political change. An experimental field study of Jewish West Bank settlers (N = 453) was conducted to understand the influence of ideology and psychological-contextual factors on resistance to change. On this basis, we examined four determinants, one ideological and three related to psychological resistance: (a) the character of the settlers (ideological vs. quality of life settlers); (b) legitimacy (size of the majority in parliament); (c) recompensation (a unilateral withdrawal with no tangible benefits, or a bilateral quid-pro-quo agreement); and (d) group-affirmations (messages that boost perceived in-group value). We measured explicit support for legal (normative) and unlawful (nonnormative) resistance, and measured implicit aggression using a lexical-decision task. Results showed that both ideological and psychological-contextual factors played a significant role in resistance: Ideological settlers showed greater support for normative resistance, and exhibited high implicit aggression, but primarily in response to perceptions of recompensation. Group affirmations, however, backfired and elicited greater resistance in this group. Quality of life settlers exhibited low support for resistance and responded more positively to group affirmations. Legitimacy played no significant role in resistance to forced evacuation. Results reveal that ideology alone does not predict resistance to imposed political change, suggesting that psychological interventions may help settler populations cope with imposed change.

46,A meta-analysis of procedures to change implicit measures,"Using a novel technique known as network meta-analysis, we synthesized evidence from 492 studies (87,418 participants) to investigate the effectiveness of procedures in changing implicit measures, which we define as response biases on implicit tasks. We also evaluated these procedures’ effects on explicit and behavioral measures. We found that implicit measures can be changed, but effects are often relatively weak ({\textbar}ds{\textbar} {\textless} .30). Most studies focused on producing short-term changes with brief, single-session manipulations. Procedures that associate sets of concepts, invoke goals or motivations, or tax mental resources changed implicit measures the most, whereas procedures that induced threat, affirmation, or specific moods/emotions changed implicit measures the least. Bias tests suggested that implicit effects could be inflated relative to their true population values. Procedures changed explicit measures less consistently and to a smaller degree than implicit measures and generally produced trivial changes in behavior. Finally, changes in implicit measures did not mediate changes in explicit measures or behavior. Our findings suggest that changes in implicit measures are possible, but those changes do not necessarily translate into changes in explicit measures or behavior.

47,"Religiosity, religious fundamentalism, and perceived threat as predictors of Muslim support for extremist violence","Religion is often seen as one of the main causes of extremist violence, such as suicide attacks. Because empirical studies analyzing this purported relationship are scarce, we investigated how religious practices and attitudes, perceived threat, and demographic variables contribute to support for extremist violence. We analyzed multinational face-to-face interview data for native Muslims with a final sample size of N = 6,576. Using multilevel ordinal regression, we found that increased support for extremist violence was strongly predicted by social religious activities and perceived threat. Conversely, aspects of individual religiosity and even religious fundamentalism were associated with a decrease in support for extremist violence. Demographic variables showed small or no significant effects. Important practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

48,Reducing exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and indoor tanning: A meta-analysis,"Objective: Skin cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and rates are increasing because of global warming. This article reports a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions to reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}). The review aimed to (a) quantify the magnitude of intervention effects on indoor tanning, sun exposure, and sunscreen use, and (b) determine which intervention strategies maximize behavior change. Method: Out of 17,437 records identified via literature searches, 190 independent tests (N = 89,365) met the inclusion criteria. Sample, intervention, and methodological characteristics, and change techniques were coded, and random effects meta-analyses and metaregressions were conducted. Results: The sample-weighted average effect size across all studies was d+ = .193 (95\% confidence interval, {CI} [.161, .226]), and there were significant effects on indoor tanning, sun exposure, and sunscreen use (d+ = .080, .149, and .196, respectively). However, there was evidence of publication bias, and trim and fill analyses indicated that the corrected effects for sun exposure and sunscreen use were of very small magnitude (d+ {\textasciitilde} .06) and were not significantly different from zero for indoor tanning (d+ = −.011, 95\% {CI} [−.096, .074]). Metaregression analyses identified several intervention strategies that predicted effect sizes. For instance, interventions delivered individually that promoted alternatives to tanning were associated with larger effect sizes for indoor tanning. Conclusion: Interventions to date have had only a modest impact on behavioral exposure to {UVR}. The present findings offer new insights into how the effectiveness of future interventions can be improved.

In 2 studies, participants completed measures of identification with humans, global citizens, and Americans as well as measures associated with peace (e.g., attitudes toward peace) and conflict (e.g., support for the war on terror). The results showed that global citizenship identification was uniquely related to peace variables above and beyond identification with humans and Americans. Furthermore, female (vs. male) participants showed greater endorsement of peace (Study 2). The findings highlight the unique content associated with global citizen identity and the prosocial values related to global citizenship identification.

50,Life lacks meaning without acceptance: Ostracism triggers suicidal thoughts,"Eleven studies (N = 2,254; 2 preregistered) examined whether ostracism would trigger suicidal thoughts and whether perceived meaning in life would account for this effect. The feeling of ostracism was induced via recalling a past experience (Studies 1a, 1c, 2c, and 3b), imagining a future experience (Studies 1d, 1e, and 2b), engaging in an online real-time interaction (Studies 1b and 2d), or receiving bogus personality feedback (Study 3a). Across all 11 studies, ostracism increased suicidal thoughts. Study 1a found that ostracism increased implicit associations of 'death' and 'me' relative to 'life' and 'me' on the Implicit Association Test of Suicide (Nock et al., 2010). In Study 1b, ostracized participants showed more suicidal thoughts in imagined stressful situations than did included participants. Studies 1c, 1d, and 1e further showed that ostracism increased explicit suicidal thoughts compared with both inclusion and neutral experiences. Furthermore, we found that perceived meaning in life accounted for ostracism’s effect on suicidal thoughts (Studies 2a and 2b), even after controlling for depressive affect (Study 2c). In Study 2d, a preregistered study, we directly compared the contributions of perceived meaning in life and the 4 basic needs and mood proposed in William’s (2007, 2009) ostracism framework, and we found that perceived meaning in life had a distinct mediating role in the ostracism-suicidal thinking link. Finally, Studies 3a and 3b found that self-affirmation exercises reduced suicidal thoughts following ostracism. Life lacks meaning without social connection, thereby activating suicidal thoughts.

51,Disrupting the system constructively: Testing the effectiveness of nonnormative nonviolent collective action,"Collective action research tends to focus on motivations of the disadvantaged group, rather than on which tactics are effective at driving the advantaged group to make concessions to the disadvantaged. We focused on the potential of nonnormative nonviolent action as a tactic to generate support for concessions among advantaged group members who are resistant to social change. We propose that this tactic, relative to normative nonviolent and to violent action, is particularly effective because it reflects constructive disruption: a delicate balance between disruption (which can put pressure on the advantaged group to respond) and perceived constructive intentions (which can help ensure that the response to action is a conciliatory one). We test these hypotheses across 4 contexts (total N = 3650). Studies 1–3 demonstrate that nonnormative nonviolent action (compared with inaction, normative nonviolent action, and violent action) is uniquely effective at increasing support for concessions to the disadvantaged among resistant advantaged group members (compared with advantaged group members more open to social change). Study 3 shows that constructive disruption mediates this effect. Study 4 shows that perceiving a real-world ongoing protest as constructively disruptive predicts support for the disadvantaged, whereas Study 5 examines these processes longitudinally over 2 months in the context of an ongoing social movement. Taken together, we show that nonnormative nonviolent action can be an effective tactic for generating support for concessions to the disadvantaged among those who are most resistant because it generates constructive disruption.

52,Healthy and unhealthy wars: The effects of ingroup-committed violence on physical and mental health,"Intergroup violence can profoundly affect the health of involved parties. Complementing existing research on ingroup-suffered violence and health, this paper proposes an integrative framework explicating how and why ingroup-committed violence can positively or negatively affect the health of ingroup members. Based on different models of social identity and health, we argue that ingroup identification (i.e., attachment and glorification) determines how people cope with ingroup-committed violence. We lay out different nondefensive strategies critically identified group members are likely to engage in, and defensive strategies uncritically identified members are likely to engage in. We further posit that nondefensive strategies are less adaptive for maintaining and/or improving health in the short (but not long) term than defensive strategies, and that ingroup identification can act as both moderator and mediator of the effects of ingroup-committed violence on health. Thus, harming outgroup members can hurt or help ingroup members. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Leidner, Bernhard and Li, Mengyao and Kardos, Peter",0,,52
53,Attachment and the Oedipus complex: Attachment orientations moderate the effects of priming Oedipal representations on the construal of romantic relationships,"In this article, we attempt to extend into the realm of romantic relationships recent findings (Biton-Bereby, Mikulincer, \& Shaver, 2019) concerning the effects of dispositional attachment anxiety and experimental reactivation of Oedipal issues on adult men’s sexual attraction to women. In 3 studies, we measured male participants’ attachment orientations, subliminally primed Oedipal or neutral mental representations, and examined the effects of the primes on mating preferences, romantic jealousy, and the appeal of physical sex within a romantic relationship. Findings indicated that men who scored higher on attachment anxiety reacted to the Oedipal prime (as compared with control primes) with heightened preference for mother-resembling women as potential mates, more intense romantic jealousy, and increased appeal of physical sex. Less attachment-anxious participants showed the opposite reactions to the Oedipal prime: reduced romantic jealousy, distancing from women who resembled mother, and weaker attraction to physical aspects of sex. The discussion focuses on integrating attachment and psychoanalytic theories.

54,Islamist terrorists in Germany and their warning behaviors: A comparative assessment of attackers and other convicts using the {TRAP}-18,"The Terrorist Radicalization Protocol 18 ({TRAP}-18) is tested on a sample of 80 people who were convicted for Islamist activities in Germany between 2006 and 2017. In the study, perpetrators of terrorist attacks will be compared to persons who have been convicted of propagandistic and financial terrorist support and of joining a terrorist organization abroad. Statistical analysis of the results shows that there are significant differences between terrorist perpetrators and persons convicted of nonviolent Islamist activities, both in the number of {TRAP}-18 items and in the proximal warning behaviors 'pathway,' 'last resort,' 'energy burst,' and 'novel aggression.' Subsequent {ROC} analyses underline both the specificity and sensitivity of the instrument. {AUC} values range from .83 to .90 for the four different models ({TRAP}-18 and the warning behavior typology as weighted and unweighted models). The highest discrimination between Islamist attackers and the non-attackers is achieved by the weighted warning behavior typology. The values for sensitivity (se = .80), specificity (sp = .93), positive predictive value (p+ = .80), and negative predictive value (p− = .93) are extremely promising.

55,Koreans’ collective victim beliefs about Japanese colonization,"To understand the current relations between Japan and Korea, it is crucial to understand how Koreans construe the historical experience of victimization due to Japanese colonization. We analyzed news articles from major Korean newspapers, examining 3 time periods during which the conflict between Japan and South Korea over how to address the past was particularly salient. Thematic analysis revealed 3 categories with several themes each, describing challenges of victimization that are met with specific coping efforts and the transgenerational transmission of memories of historical victimization that keep these experiences salient. This article presents the first social psychological investigation of collective victim beliefs in Korea and contributes to the literature by integrating theoretical perspectives from appraisal theory and the collective victimhood literature, as well as expanding the diversity and complexity of collective victim beliefs. The current study also has practical implications for addressing strained relations between South Korea and Japan.

56,Evaluating the benefits of a rapport-based approach to investigative interviews: A training study with law enforcement investigators,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a rapport-based approach to interviewing that includes productive questioning skills, conversational rapport, and relational rapport-building tactics. Hypotheses: We predicted that training police investigators in a rapport-based approach would significantly increase the use of rapport-based tactics and that such tactics would directly influence the interviewee’s perceptions of rapport and indirectly lead to increased cooperation and disclosure of information. Method: We trained federal, state, and local law enforcement investigators (N = 67) in the use of evidence-based interviewing techniques. Both before and after this training, investigators interviewed semi cooperative subjects (N = 125). Interviews were coded for the use of various interview tactics, as well as subjects’ disclosure. Participants also completed a questionnaire regarding their perceptions of the interviewer and their decision to cooperate with the interviewer. Results: Evaluations of the training were positive, with high ratings of learning, preparedness to use tactics, and likelihood of use following the training. In posttraining interviews, investigators significantly increased their use of evidence-based tactics, including productive questioning, conversational rapport, and relational rapport-building tactics. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that investigators’ use of the evidence-based interview tactics was directly associated with increased perceptions of rapport and trust and indirectly associated with increased cooperation and information disclosure. Conclusions: We demonstrated that rapport-based interview tactics could be successfully trained and that using such tactics can facilitate perceptions of rapport and trust, reduce individuals’ resistance to cooperate, and increase information yield.

57,"Mortality salience, group membership, \& reciprocity","This study investigated the effects of mortality salience, group membership, partner's behavior, and adherence to the norms of positive and negative reciprocity. Three-hundred-eighty-four participants completed the either a mortality salience or control (where mortality was not salient) induction, a group membership induction, a personal norms of reciprocity scale, one round of a single-shot trust game (a measure of positive reciprocity), and one round of a single-shot ultimatum game (a measure of negative reciprocity). During the trust game, an ostensible interaction partner received a small monetary endowment, and contributed either that entire endowment or less than half of it (keeping the rest for him/herself) to a general fund that was guaranteed to triple in value before being transferred to the participant. The participant's task was then to determine how much of the general fund to return to the interaction partner, keeping the rest for him/herself. In the ultimatum game, the ostensible interaction partner was given a \$20 endowment by the experimenter, he/she either proposed an even \$10/\$10 split of that endowment with the participant, or a \$12/\$8 split (in his/her own favor). The participant's task was to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed split. For positive reciprocity, I found a main effect of adherence to the norm of positive reciprocity, and a main effect of partner's behavior that was qualified by a partner's behavior by mortality salience interaction, such that when participants were not primed with mortality salience, they returned more of the general fund when they were paired with a generous partner then when they were paired with a stingy partner. For negative reciprocity, I found, that their decisions about whether to accept or reject Player 1's offer were again affected by the partner's behavior, and the degree to which the participant adhered to the norm of negative reciprocity.

58,Secure your buffers or stare at the sun? Terror management theory and psychotherapy integration,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) offers an empirical framework to explain how human beings function despite their awareness and fear of death. Research on {TMT} has shown that to buffer against death anxiety, people strive to meet the standards of their cultural worldview. Although the theoretical bases and experimental findings of {TMT} research have been compelling within social psychology, their application to mental health and especially to psychotherapy integration has never been properly examined. We argue that a more comprehensive integration of {TMT} findings with psychotherapy research and practice can prompt a deeper understanding of psychopathology, mental health, and clinical intervention. As a starting point for this integration, we review the existing literature on {TMT} and psychopathology and offer the {TMT} conceptualization of death anxiety as a hallmark example of the consistencies and gaps between {TMT} and traditional clinical psychology. Four key areas of future inquiry are proposed that may yield meaningful theoretical and clinical insights and lead to greater integration of {TMT} with contemporary psychotherapy research and practice. A clinical case example is also presented to illustrate the potential application of {TMT} principles to the treatment of death anxiety.

60,"Hypocritical flip-flop, or courageous evolution? When leaders change their moral minds","How do audiences react to leaders who change their opinion after taking moral stances? We propose that people believe moral stances are stronger commitments, compared with pragmatic stances; we therefore explore whether and when audiences believe those commitments can be broken. We find that audiences believe moral commitments should not be broken, and thus that they deride as hypocritical leaders who claim a moral commitment and later change their views. Moreover, they view them as less effective and less worthy of support. Although participants found a moral mind changer especially hypocritical when they disagreed with the new view, the effect persisted even among participants who fully endorsed the new view. We draw these conclusions from analyses and meta-analyses of 15 studies (total N = 5,552), using recent statistical advances to verify the robustness of our findings. In several of our studies, we also test for various possible moderators of these effects; overall we find only 1 promising finding: some evidence that 2 specific justifications for moral mind changes—citing a personally transformative experience, or blaming external circumstances rather than acknowledging opinion change—help moral leaders appear more courageous, but no less hypocritical. Together, our findings demonstrate a lay belief that moral views should be stable over time; they also suggest a downside for leaders in using moral framings.

61,Materialism across the life span: An age-period-cohort analysis,"This research examined the development of materialism across the life span. Two initial studies revealed that (a) lay beliefs were that materialism declines with age and (b) previous research findings also implied a modest, negative relationship between age and materialism. Yet, previous research has considered age only as a linear control variable, thereby precluding the possibility of more intricate relationships between age and materialism. Moreover, prior studies have relied on cross-sectional data and thus confound age and cohort effects. To improve on this, the main study used longitudinal data from 8 waves spanning 9 years of over 4,200 individuals (16 to 90 years) to examine age effects on materialism while controlling for cohort and period effects. Using a multivariate multilevel latent growth model, it found that materialism followed a curvilinear trajectory across the life span, with the lowest levels at middle age and higher levels before and after that. Thus, in contrast to lay beliefs, materialism increased in older age. Moreover, age effects on materialism differed markedly between 3 core themes of materialism: acquisition centrality, possession-defined success, and acquisition as the pursuit of happiness. In particular, acquisition centrality and possession-defined success were higher at younger and older age. Independent of these age effects, older birth cohorts were oriented more toward possession-defined success, whereas younger birth cohorts were oriented more toward acquisition centrality. The economic downturn since 2008 led to a decrease in acquisition as the pursuit of happiness and in desires for personal growth, but to an increase in desires for achievement.

62,The role of sensation seeking in political violence: An extension of the Significance Quest Theory,"Adventure and excitement have often been invoked to explain why people engage in political violence, yet empirical evidence on the topic has thus far been anecdotal. The present research sought to fill this gap in knowledge by examining the role of sensation seeking in political violence and integrating this concept with Significance Quest Theory (Kruglanski, Chen, Dechesne, Fishman, \& Orehek, 2009; Kruglanski et al., 2013). Extending prior research on violent extremism, Study 1 found that sensation seeking mediated the relation between meaning in life and willingness to self-sacrifice and support for political violence. Study 2 established temporal precedence of the variables in the mediation model, using a longitudinal design. Studies 3 and 4 experimentally replicated findings of Studies 1 and 2. In Studies 5a and 5b, we found that sensation seeking predicts support for a real life violent activist group. In Studies 6a and 6b, the positive evaluation of a violent activist group by individuals high in sensation seeking was explained by how exciting they perceived the group to be. Finally, Study 7 introduced an intervention targeting the sensation seeking motive by presenting participants with a peaceful (less exciting vs. exciting) activism group. As hypothesized, providing individuals high in sensation seeking with a peaceful yet exciting group mitigated their support for extreme behavior.

63,"Romantic relationship status, stress, and maturing out of problematic drinking","Objective: The current study examined the unique influences of romantic relationship status and episodic and chronic stress associated with relationships in predicting changes in alcohol consumption and drinking motivations from college to post-college life. Method: Moderate to heavy college student drinkers reported their drinking level and drinking motives using an Internet-based daily diary for 30 days in college and again 5 years later. At the post-college wave, participants also completed a semi-structured phone-based interview to assess romantic relationship stress. Results: Multiple regression analysis indicated that chronic relationship stress and relationship dissolution stress were uniquely related to mean daily levels of post-college drinking to cope ({DTC}) motivation, but not to mean daily levels of enhancement motivation. Some evidence was found for the effect of relationship status, but not stress, on mean daily heavy drinking levels. We also found evidence that chronic stress moderated the effect of relationship dissolution stress, with individuals showing higher mean daily chronic stress levels displaying a stronger positive association between relationship dissolution and post-college {DTC} motivation. Conclusions: Results are discussed in terms of how negative reinforcement processes might be an important mechanism underlying commonly found associations between romantic relationship status and problematic drinking during young adulthood.

64,The social-safety system: Fortifying relationships in the face of the unforeseeable,"A model of the social-safety system is proposed to explain how people sustain a sense of safety in the relational world when they are not able to foresee the behavior of others. In this model, people can escape the acute anxiety posed by agents in their personal relational world behaving unexpectedly (e.g., spouse, child) by defensively imposing well-intentioned motivations on the agents controlling their sociopolitical relational world (e.g., President, Congress). Conversely, people can escape the acute anxiety posed by sociopolitical agents behaving unexpectedly by defensively imposing well-intentioned motivations on the agents controlling their personal relational world. Two daily diary studies, a longitudinal study of the 2018 midterm election, and a 3-year longitudinal study of newlyweds supported the hypotheses. On a daily basis, people who were less certain they could trust their romantic partner defended against acutely unforeseeable behavior in one relational world by affirming faith in the well-intentioned motivations of agents in the alternate world. Moreover, when people were more in the personal daily habit of finding safety in the alternate relational world in the face of the unexpected, those who were initially uncertain they could trust their romantic partner later evidenced greater comfort depending on their personal relationship partners.

We assumed that religious {ST} is related to exclusive identity (the distinction between ingroup and outgroup of recipient is important for decisions about help), while nonreligious {ST} is related to inclusive identity (the distinction between ingroup and outgroup of recipient is not important for decisions about help). In line with predictions, it has been shown that religious {ST} leads to increased helping ingroups, but also decreased helping outgroups. On the contrary, nonreligious {ST} leads to increased willingness to help both ingroups and outgroups. Current studies indicate that distinguishing between religious and nonreligious {ST} is important for predicting helping behaviors (declarative and actual) toward people with different group identification.

66,Honesty-humility under threat: Self-uncertainty destroys trust among the nice guys,"Recent research on humans’ prosociality has highlighted the crucial role of Honesty-Humility, a basic trait in the {HEXACO} personality model. There is overwhelming evidence that Honesty-Humility predicts prosocial behavior across a vast variety of situations. In the present contribution, we cloud this rosy picture, examining a condition under which individuals high in Honesty-Humility reduce prosocial behavior. Specifically, we propose that under self-uncertainty, it is particularly those individuals high in Honesty-Humility who reduce trust in unknown others and become less prosocial. In 5 studies, we assessed Honesty-Humility, manipulated self-uncertainty, and measured interpersonal trust or trust in social institutions using behavioral or questionnaire measures. In Study 1, individuals high (vs. low) in Honesty-Humility showed higher levels of trust. This relation was mediated by their positive social expectations about the trustworthiness of others. Inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly in individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Studies 2–5). Making use of measuring the mediator (Studies 2 and 3) and applying a causal chain design (Studies 4a and 4b), it is shown that individuals high in Honesty-Humility reduced trust because self-uncertainty decreased positive social expectations about others. We end with an applied perspective, showing that Honesty-Humility is predictive of trust in social institutions (e.g., trust in the police; Study 5a), and that self-uncertainty undermined trust in the police especially for individuals high in Honesty-Humility (Study 5b). By these means, the present research shows that individuals high in Honesty-Humility are not unconditionally prosocial. Further implications for Honesty-Humility as well as for research on self-uncertainty and trust are discussed.

67,Working safely at some times and unsafely at others: A typology and within-person process model of safety-related work behaviors,"Why do individuals choose to work safely in some instances and unsafely in others? Though this inherently within-person question is straightforward, the preponderance of between-person theory and research in the workplace safety literature is not equipped to answer it. Additionally, the limited way in which safety-related behaviors tend to be conceptualized further restricts understanding of why individuals vary in their safety-related actions. We use a goal-focused approach to conceptually address this question of behavioral variability and contribute to workplace safety research in 2 key ways. First, we establish an updated typology of safety-related behaviors that differentiates behaviors based on goal choice (i.e., safe vs. unsafe behaviors), goal-directedness (i.e., intentional vs. unintentional behaviors), and the means of goal pursuit (i.e., commission vs. omission and promotion vs. prevention-focused behaviors). Second, using an expectancy-value theoretical framework to explain variance in goal choice, we establish within-person propositions stating that safety-related goal choice and subsequent behaviors are a function of the target of safety-related behaviors, the instrumentality and resource requirement of behaviors, and the perceived severity, likelihood, and immediacy of the threats associated with behaviors. Taken together, we define what safety-related behaviors are, explain how they differ, and offer propositions concerning when and why they may vary within-persons. We explore potential between-person moderators of our theoretical propositions and discuss the practical implications of our typology and process model of safety-related behavior.

68,When acute adversity improves psychological health: A social–contextual framework,"Human beings are routinely exposed to varying forms of acute adversity. Our responses take varying forms too, ranging from chronic distress to resilience. Although this pronounced variability is widely recognized, one possible outcome of acute adversity has been invariably, though understandably, ignored: an improvement in psychological and social functioning. In this analysis, I argue that, under some conditions, people can experience marked psychological improvement after acute adversity. I describe this response pattern as psychosocial gains from adversity ({PGA}) and define it as favorable and reliable change on an index of psychological functioning from before to after exposure to adversity. In the present article, first I distinguish {PGA} from traditional perspectives on growth after adversity on the basis of key conceptual differences. I then review empirical evidence for {PGA} as a replicable response pattern following different forms of adversity, including bereavement, military deployment, and mass trauma. I propose a multilevel theoretical model for {PGA} that focuses on automatic prosocial affiliative behaviors and group-level contextual factors that are conditioned by acute adversity. I describe moderators and boundary conditions at different levels of analysis that will enhance or detract from the likelihood of {PGA}. I conclude with the implications of {PGA} for theory and empirical research on postadversity outcomes and outline a research agenda to better understand it.

69,Together they are Troy and Chase: Who supports demonetization of gay content on {YouTube}?,"{YouTube} content creators often depend on advertising revenue for funding their channels. Recent changes by {YouTube} to curb extremists has resulted in many creators of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender content losing their ability to earn advertising revenue (termed demonetization), which we view as a form of censorship by proxy. The present study explored individuals’ support for the demonetization of gay {YouTube} content in a sample of 247 U.S. residents who viewed a demonetized video from the channel Troy and Chase. Results found that support for demonetization was predicted by homonegativity, conservative ideology, and perceptions that gay {YouTube} content had a negative impact on the self and others. Response surface modeling revealed qualified evidence for a severity first-person effect (the self more negatively impacted than others) being related to increased demonetization support.

In this article, we review research on group-based emotion regulation, focusing on the role of motivation and distinguishing between different emotion regulation motives in the group context. For that purpose, we first define group-based emotions and their effects on both intragroup and intergroup processes. We then review motives for group-based emotion regulation, suggesting 3 classes of group-based motives: (a) intragroup motives pertaining to what I want to be in relation to the group (e.g., increase sense of belongingness), (b) intergroup motives pertaining to what I want my group’s relationship with other groups to be (e.g., preserve the status quo), and (c) meta group motives pertaining to what I want my group to be (e.g., perceive the ingroup more positvely). We discuss the implications of these different motives for group-based emotion regulation and how they might inform scholars in the field.

71,The road to extremism: Field and experimental evidence that significance loss-induced need for closure fosters radicalization,"The present studies examined the hypothesis that loss of personal significance fuels extremism via the need for cognitive closure. Situations of significance loss—those that make one feel ashamed, humiliated, or demeaned—are inconsistent with the desire for a positive self-image, and instill a sense of uncertainty about the self. Consequently, individuals become motivated to seek certainty and closure that affords the restoration of personal significance. Extremist ideologies should thus increase in appeal, because they promise clear-cut strategies for such restoration. These notions were supported in a series of studies ranging from field surveys of political extremists imprisoned in the Philippines (Study 1) and Sri Lanka (Study 2) to experiments conducted with American samples (Studies 3–4). Implications of these findings are considered for the psychology of extremism, and for approaches to counterradicalization, and deradicalization.

73,Security versus growth: Existential tradeoffs of various religious perspectives,"Religion serves many social and existential functions. In 3 studies (N = 1,197), we examine how religious belief orientations involve tradeoffs that prioritize either existential security or tolerance toward religiously different groups. In Study 1 (N = 205), security-focused beliefs were related to greater meaning in life and lower tolerance, whereas growth-focused religious beliefs were related to lower meaning in life and greater tolerance. In Study 2 (N = 298), we found that a security-focused religious belief orientation (i.e., defensive theological beliefs) was associated with existential well-being, and religious commitment enhanced this relationship. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 694), using an experimental priming manipulation, we found that meaning threats resulted in greater existential anxiety for those with growth-focused beliefs (i.e., quest religion). Together, this research highlights how religious beliefs may prioritize either (a) existential security (i.e., security-oriented), or (b) ability to span ideological differences to form alliances (i.e., growth-oriented).

74,Ontological insecurity as an emergent phenomenon: Bottom-up securitization of migration in Serbia,"One of the central debates in Ontological Security Studies ({OSS}) has been about the level-of-analysis. While some authors focus on individuals, others have scaled up the concept and applied it to collectives such as states as the main ontological security seekers. In this article, we contribute to the level-of-analysis debate in {OSS} by providing a novel argument in defense of scaling up. By drawing on the literatures on complexity and securitization, we conceptualize ontological security as an emergent phenomenon. It arises from the ground-up and is driven by feedback loops in a non-linear and spontaneous fashion from horizontal micro-interactions and securitizations from below, ultimately reaching a tipping point. We illustrate this argument in a case study of anti-immigrant mobilization in Serbia since the outbreak of the European migration crisis (2015–2020). At the outset of the crisis, state officials interpreted the migration crisis as a manageable and temporary situation, adopted an 'open door' policy and even banned far-right extremist demonstrations against migration. Over time, however, ontological insecurity over the migrant threat has gradually emerged from the bottom-up through a cascade of rumors, connective action, and everyday securitizing acts. While it might be too early to conclude that the national tipping point has been reached, this case study clearly shows why ontological insecurity merits to be studied as an emergent phenomenon.

75,"The central role of social identity in oppression, discrimination and social-structural violence: Collective identity stressors and traumas, their dynamics and mental health impact","Development-based trauma framework ({DBTF}) identified collective identity stressors and traumas ({CISTs}) and other trauma types, such as personal identity traumas ({PITs}), physical identity or survival trauma ({PISTs}), preidentity such as attachment traumas, and postidentity or secondary trauma ({IST}). We utilized pooled data from 9 samples from different minorities, refugees, and other victims of {CIST} (N = 2471) that used measures of cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}), cumulative trauma disorders ({CTDs}), and existential anxieties ({EAAs}). {PROCESS} macro (Models 4, 6, and 7) was used to analyze {CIST} direct, mediated, and moderated effects, and the serial trajectories of its mediators. We found significant direct effects of {CIST} on {PTSD}, {CTD}, and {EAA}, in addition to mediated indirect effects via {PIST} and {PIT}. Secondary and attachment traumas moderated its mediated effects. The study validated the integrated conceptual model of {CIST}.

76,Does the awareness of mortality shape people's openness to violence and conflict? An examination of terror management theory,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) proposes that evoking death‐related thoughts (mortality salience; {MS}) in individuals or groups can lead to stronger worldview defence and greater support for extremist violence. In three experiments, we tested whether an {MS} manipulation, and associated moderators, increased support for extremist violence. In Australian university students, Study 1 found no statistically significant main or moderated effects for {MS} on measures of extremist violence. However, participants exposed to the {MS} manipulation reported increases in conservative religiosity (belief in divine power). In Study 2, the {MS} manipulation had no significant effect on support for extremist violence for Australian university students primed with an antiviolent extremism norm. And in young Australian Jewish people (Study 3), the {MS} manipulation did not increase support for violence against migrants. However, there was an increase in support for policies that act to fight against violent extremism in Iraq and Syria in those exposed to the {MS} manipulation. Across three studies, we find little support for the hypothesis that {MS} results in increased support for violent extremism. Larger more methodological sound studies are needed to address inconsistencies in the evidence surrounding {TMT} and the {MS} hypothesis, at least in regards to violence and extremism.

77,Blowing in the (social) wind: Implications of extrinsic esteem contingencies for terror management and health,"In 4 studies, the role of extrinsic esteem contingencies in adjusting to shifting health-relevant standards when managing existential fears was examined. Study 1 demonstrated that after reminders of death, higher dispositional focus on extrinsic self-esteem contingencies predicted greater interest in tanning. Using a more domain-specific approach, Study 2 showed that, after being reminded of death, the more individuals smoke for social esteem reasons, the more compelling they find an antismoking commercial that exposes adverse social consequences of smoking. Study 3 explored how situational factors (i.e., priming a contingent relational schema) that implicate extrinsic contingencies facilitated the impact of shifting standard primes on tanning intentions after mortality salience. Finally, Study 4 found that mortality salience led to increased endorsement of exercise as a basis of self-worth when participants who derive self-esteem from extrinsic sources visualized someone who exercises. Together, these studies demonstrate that reminders of death interact with prevalent social standards to influence everyday health decisions.

78,The memory remains: How heavy metal fans buffer against the fear of death,"Heavy metal music is often associated with death and dying by nonfans whereas members of this subculture report that listening to metal music is their escape from depression and even helpful against death-related thoughts. According to terror management theory, self-esteem and cultural worldview serve as a symbolic, 2-component buffer system working against the fear of death. What remains unclear in recent research on terror management theory is if (a) the presentation of cultural goods directly after mortality salience is enough to help against the fear of death or if the buffer components still need to be activated and (b) if the activation of 1 buffer component is enough. Metal music can be seen as cultural good for fans and thereby can form part of their social identity. Two studies investigated whether heavy metal music is able to serve as a cultural worldview buffer against existential anguish by using implicit measurements. In Study 1, we found that fans had no further need to increase their cultural worldview but only if they listened to metal music after the induction of mortality salience. Results of Study 2 revealed that metal music made further support of self-esteem unnecessary for fans whereas nonfans still had the need to increase their self-esteem.

79,Enjoying life in the face of death: East–West differences in responses to mortality salience,"Five experiments explored the hypothesis that thinking about one's own death activates thoughts about enjoying one's life as moderated by culture. Given that Eastern cultures, relative to Western ones, are more holistic and endorse notions of 'yin and yang' (e.g., where 'good' and 'bad' coexist in all things), we hypothesized that East Asians would be more likely than European Americans to think about life and strive more to enjoy life when mortality salience ({MS}) is evoked. As predicted, {MS} led East Asians, but not European Americans, to (a) activate more life-related thoughts (Study 1); (b) express greater interest in enjoyable daily life activities (Study 2); and (c) report enjoying daily life activities more (Study 3). Cultural differences in holism mediated the tendency to enjoy life in the face of death (Study 4), and experimental induction of holism caused greater life enjoyment in response to {MS} (Study 5).

80,Cultural withdrawal during {COVID}-19 lockdown: Impact in a sample of 828 artists and recipients of highbrow culture in Germany,"Dealing with arts is an important predictor for psychological well-being and health. The implications of the standstill of public cultural life during the lockdown in Germany is studied among 828 producers (36\%) or consumers (36\%) of art, or subjects claiming both roles (28\%), from performative arts, music, and other forms of cultural engagement. Prelockdown frequency of visiting, respectively, acting at cultural events was on average 1 event every 8.4th day in the consumer group, 5.9 days in the producer group, and 6.1 days in the group claiming both roles. Producers reported a loss of 1 active event every 4.8th day, the producer/consumer group each 6.1 days. Receptive events cancelled during the lockdown hit all 3 groups comparably (1 event every 13.7th day). Existential threat or serious mood disorder was reported by less than 10\% in all 3 respondent groups; 38\% of the consumer group reported no cultural withdrawal and even advantages. Both other groups with active involvement in cultural events faced no negative (or even positive) impact in over 25\%. In a multivariate classification tree analysis, most prominently the size of receptive as well as active losses proved influential on successful coping. Neither sociodemographic characteristics, nor living situation or health condition could be shown to exert a direct impact. Precluding people affine to highbrow culture from attending seems to be an independent risk factor at least for well-being. Potentially resulting mental health problems have to be carefully monitored during the ongoing pandemic.

81,Why Do People Need Self-Esteem? A Theoretical and Empirical Review,"Terror management theory ({TMT}; J. Greenberg, T. Pyszczynski, \& S. Solomon, 1986) posits that people are motivated to pursue positive self-evaluations because self-esteem provides a buffer against the omnipresent potential for anxiety engendered by the uniquely human awareness of mortality. Empirical evidence relevant to the theory is reviewed showing that high levels of self-esteem reduce anxiety and anxiety-related defensive behavior, reminders of one's mortality increase self-esteem striving and defense of self-esteem against threats in a variety of domains, high levels of self-esteem eliminate the effect of reminders of mortality on both self-esteem striving and the accessibility of death-related thoughts, and convincing people of the existence of an afterlife eliminates the effect of mortality salience on self-esteem striving. {TMT} is compared with other explanations for why people need self-esteem, and a critique of the most prominent of these, sociometer theory, is provided.

82,Interviewing to elicit information: Using priming to promote disclosure,"Research on implicit cognition has found that activating mental concepts can lead people to behave in ways that are consistent with the primed concept. In a pilot study we tested the effects of priming attachment security on the accessibility of disclosure-related concepts. Subsequently, we tested whether activating disclosure concepts by priming attachment security would influence people’s forthcomingness. Participants (N = 102) delivered a flash drive to a confederate who exposed them to details of a mock eco terrorism conspiracy, which they were subsequently interviewed about. Before being interviewed, half of the participants were primed; the other half were not. Results showed that primed participants disclosed significantly more information than those who were not primed. Our findings highlight the need for further research on basic nonconscious processes in investigative interviews, as such influences can affect the outcome of the interview. The operation of nonconscious influences in such contexts has implications for practitioners, who may be able to utilize priming to facilitate disclosure.

83,Christian self-enhancement,"People overestimate themselves in domains that are central to their self-concept. Critically, the psychological status of this 'self-centrality principle' remains unclear. One view regards the principle as an inextricable part of human nature and, thus, as universal and resistant to normative pressure. A contrasting view regards the principle as liable to pressure (and subsequent modification) from self-effacement norms, thus questioning its universality. Advocates of the latter view point to Christianity’s robust self-effacement norms, which they consider particularly effective in curbing self-enhancement, and ascribe Christianity an ego-quieting function. Three sets of studies examined the self-centrality principle among Christians. Studies 1A and 1B (N = 2,118) operationalized self-enhancement as better-than-average perceptions on the domains of commandments of faith (self-centrality: Christians ≫ nonbelievers) and commandments of communion (self-centrality: Christians {\textgreater} nonbelievers). Studies 2A–2H (N = 1,779) operationalized self-enhancement as knowledge overclaiming on the domains of Christianity (self-centrality: Christians ≫ nonbelievers), communion (self-centrality: Christians {\textgreater} nonbelievers), and agency (self-centrality: Christians ≈ nonbelievers). Studies 3A–3J (N = 1,956) operationalized self-enhancement as grandiose narcissism on the domains of communion (self-centrality: Christians {\textgreater} nonbelievers) and agency (self-centrality: Christians ≈ nonbelievers). The results converged across studies, yielding consistent evidence for Christian self-enhancement. Relative to nonbelievers, Christians self-enhanced strongly in domains central to the Christian self-concept. The results also generalized across countries with differing levels of religiosity. Christianity does not quiet the ego. The self-centrality principle is resistant to normative pressure, universal, and rooted in human nature.

84,A comprehensive meta-analysis of money priming,"Research on money priming typically investigates whether exposure to money-related stimuli can affect people’s thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behaviors (for a review, see Vohs, 2015). Our study answers the call for a comprehensive meta-analysis examining the available evidence on money priming (Vadillo, Hardwicke, \& Shanks, 2016). By conducting a systematic search of published and unpublished literature on money priming, we sought to achieve three key goals. First, we aimed to assess the presence of biases in the available published literature (e.g., publication bias). Second, in the case of such biases, we sought to derive a more accurate estimate of the effect size after correcting for these biases. Third, we aimed to investigate whether design factors such as prime type and study setting moderated the money priming effects. Our overall meta-analysis included 246 suitable experiments and showed a significant overall effect size estimate (Hedges’ g = .31, 95\% {CI} [0.26, 0.36]). However, publication bias and related biases are likely given the asymmetric funnel plots, Egger’s test and two other tests for publication bias. Moderator analyses offered insight into the variation of the money priming effect, suggesting for various types of study designs whether the effect was present, absent, or biased. We found the largest money priming effect in lab studies investigating a behavioral dependent measure using a priming technique in which participants actively handled money. Future research should use sufficiently powerful preregistered studies to replicate these findings.

Using longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we investigate associations between parenting beliefs and behaviors, child temperament, and attachment security during early childhood in relation to adult political ideology and party affiliation at age 26 years (N = 1,364). Young children’s fearful temperament and anxious attachment security, as well as mothers’ authoritarian parenting beliefs in early childhood, predicted conservative political orientations at age 26. Children’s abilities to focus attention and avoidant attachment security predicted liberal orientations. These findings provide evidence that multiple aspects of early developmental experience—temperament, parenting, and infant–mother attachment—are associated with later political orientations.

87,Cognitive and personality correlates of trait disgust and their relationship to condemnation of nonpurity moral transgressions,"Past research has found that individuals who are more sensitive to physically disgusting stimuli also condemn moral transgressions more harshly. However, there is debate about whether this condemnation includes transgressions that do not involve impure behaviors. We present a meta-analysis of 6 studies (N = 1082) which suggests that trait disgust is associated with condemnation of nonpurity transgressions. This relationship was primarily explained by sensitivity toward the very core disgust stimuli that those transgressions lack. We next tested whether this relationship might be mediated by a third variable. We found that trait core disgust was associated with higher orderliness, lower deviance sensitivity, and preference for intuitive thinking; these variables also correlated with moral condemnation. Trait disgust was also associated with lower generalized social trust, but trust was not correlated with moral condemnation. Neither trait disgust nor moral condemnation were associated with ethnocentrism. Further, none of these variables mediated the relationship between trait disgust and condemnation. Taken together, our results support a role for trait disgust in moral judgments outside of the purity domain, but leave unexplained its association with condemnation of nonpurity transgressions.

88,Terror management and biculturalism: When the salience of cultural duality affects worldview defense in the face of death,"Terror management theory posits that cultural worldviews provide protection against death-related anxiety. To the extent that worldviews often encompass competing beliefs, the present research investigated the effect of the salience of an incompatibility between worldview elements. French nationals of second- or third-immigrant generation (N = 193) were exposed to compatible or incompatible aspects of their cultural identities and then induced to contemplate their own death or a neutral topic. Participants reminded of their mortality renounced their ethnic identity more in the cultural incompatibility condition, and this effect was confined to those who initially presented an integrated (or bicultural) identity. Mortality salience led to monoculturalism striving when bicultural participants considered incompatible aspects of both their cultures, hence verifying the importance of upholding a strong and unwavering cultural worldview to cope with death awareness. The role of death-thoughts accessibility and religious attitudes following participants’ efforts to shore up their cultural worldview is discussed.

89,The new identity theft: Perceptions of cultural appropriation in intergroup contexts,"Cultural appropriation has been described and discussed within academic and everyday discourse, but little research has examined its role in the psychological context of intergroup relations. We sought to examine whether minority and majority group members (i.e., Black and White Americans) would differentially judge instances of cultural exchange as cultural appropriation. Five experiments (3 were preregistered on {OSF}) using a variety of potential cases of cultural appropriation demonstrated that Black participants were more likely than White participants to view these incidents as appropriation when they involved White perpetrators appropriating Black culture (vs. scenarios of Black perpetrators appropriating White culture), an effect mediated by distinctiveness threat. Black (vs. White) participants were also more likely to perceive White actors who appropriate Black culture as harmful and as intentional. In Study 4, explicit manipulation of distinctiveness threat eliminated the participant race effect: Perceivers viewed White perpetrators as more appropriative than Black perpetrators. When actors were portrayed as using either an ingroup or outgroup cultural product (Study 5), participants perceived use of an outgroup cultural product as more appropriative. Studies 3–5 were preregistered on {OSF}. This research illuminates how group-based status interacts with and adds to perpetrator prototypically to influence perceptions of cultural appropriation, distinguishes perception of appropriation from perception of racism, and points to the importance of distinctiveness threat as a contributor to differential race-based perceptions. Implications of perceiving cultural appropriation for intergroup relations are discussed.

90,Assessing heterogeneity and power in replications of psychological experiments,"In this study, we reanalyze recent empirical research on replication from a meta-analytic perspective. We argue that there are different ways to define 'replication failure,' and that analyses can focus on exploring variation among replication studies or assess whether their results contradict the findings of the original study. We apply this framework to a set of psychological findings that have been replicated and assess the sensitivity of these analyses. We find that tests for replication that involve only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28\% to 43\%) ensembles produced heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity. Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work on designing replication studies to ensure analyses are sufficiently sensitive.

91,Understanding the diversity and fluidity of human morality through evolutionary psychology,"Evolutionary psychology promotes a functional conceptualization of human morality. A key insight from evolutionary studies on morality is that natural selection should favor both diversity and fluidity in morality. Moral diversity is evidenced by moral psychological research on within- and cross-society variations in the endorsement of moral concerns. Moral fluidity is exhibited in the conditional expression of moral hypocrisy, situational effects on intuitive versus rational moral processing, and environmental effects on the degree of prosociality. From this perspective, empirical methods and evolutionary models can be combined in future research to better explicate how morality develops and manifests in various environments.

92,Fear of death amplifies retributive justice motivations and encourages political violence,"Terror management research indicates that mortality salience ({MS}) increases support for violent solutions to conflict. The current research examines, in 4 experimental studies, whether this effect is primarily affected by rational considerations of costs of benefits, or whether a retributive justice mindset overrides a utilitarian calculus. In Study 1, justice primes increased, and utility primes decreased Palestinian citizens of Israel’s support for violence when death was salient. Study 2 replicated this effect replacing the generic death prime with a reminder of the Nakba (Palestinian catastrophe). In Studies 3 and 4, {MS} increased support for military reprisals when justice concerns were high and expected utility was low among both Israelis and South Koreans. These results from 3 distinct cultural samples underscore the role of existential concerns in fostering support for violent solutions to conflict because of the perceived justice of violence, even when such violent policies are low in pragmatic utility.

93,Transitioning fractured identities: A grounded theory of veterans’ experiences of operational stress injuries,"Combat soldiers experience operational stress injuries ({OSIs}), exacerbating mental illnesses, social difficulties, and spiritual or moral distress. Although research continues to explore {OSIs}, one of the least understood and underresearched aspects are the perspectives of veterans themselves. The purpose of this research was to determine what elements of {OSIs} veterans deemed to be most injurious to them and why and develop an explanatory theory exclusively from veterans’ perspectives. This research was conducted using classical grounded theory. Semistructured interviews were carried out with 18 Canadian combat veterans who had {OSIs} related to their military service. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and constantly compared in accordance with the grounded theory method, to discover underlying key theoretical categories. The conceptual theory emerged as transitioning fractured identities and participants deemed 2 interrelated categories as being injurious: fracturing experiences and limboizing. Fracturing experiences were nearly synonymous with the current classification of moral injury, whereas limboizing referred to the military-to-civilian transition. Veterans expressed that unresolved morally injurious experiences often began their negative mental and emotional health trajectories, which frequently culminated in a psychiatric diagnosis and being medically released from the military. In addition, a failed military-to-civilian transition may be an important and yet unrecognized component of {OSIs}, in which moral injury may play a significant role. Veterans described effective {OSIs} treatment as not just focusing on their mental illness symptomology but rather as treatments that are equally capable of addressing their emotional and spiritual distress, lack of identity, and fractured sense of self.

94,Why does ingroup identification shield people from death anxiety? The role of perceived collective continuity and group entitativity,"Research to date guided by terror management theory has demonstrated that mortality salience increases ingroup identification. However, the process that leads from death reminders to group investment has remained underinvestigated. We tested a model in which mortality salience increased the perceived continuity of the group while at the same time strengthening the perception of group entitativity. In turn, higher perceived group entitativity led to enhanced ingroup identification. Three-path mediation analysis showed that mortality salience transmitted its effects onto ingroup identification indirectly, progressing first through perceived collective continuity and then through ingroup entitativity. Moderated mediation analysis revealed that personal self-esteem and the need for closure did not moderate this effect of mortality salience on ingroup identification.

95,"Unconscious vigilance: Worldview defense without adaptations for terror, coalition, or uncertainty management","Individuals subtly reminded of death, coalitional challenges, or feelings of uncertainty display exaggerated preferences for affirmations and against criticisms of their cultural in-groups. Terror management, coalitional psychology, and uncertainty management theories postulate this 'worldview defense' effect as the output of mechanisms evolved either to allay the fear of death, foster social support, or reduce anxiety by increasing adherence to cultural values. In 4 studies, we report evidence for an alternative perspective. We argue that worldview defense owes to unconscious vigilance, a state of accentuated reactivity to affective targets (which need not relate to cultural worldviews) that follows detection of subtle alarm cues (which need not pertain to death, coalitional challenges, or uncertainty). In Studies 1 and 2, death-primed participants produced exaggerated ratings of worldview-neutral affective targets. In Studies 3 and 4, subliminal threat manipulations unrelated to death, coalitional challenges, or uncertainty evoked worldview defense. These results are discussed as they inform evolutionary interpretations of worldview defense and future investigations of the influence of unconscious alarm on judgment.

This discrepancy can be explained, if one takes into account that people define and value their self both in individual and in collective terms. Two studies (N = 367 and N = 263) examined the extent to which competence (an aspect of agency), morality, and sociability (the aspects of communion) promote high self-esteem at the individual and the collective level. In both studies, competence was the strongest predictor of self-esteem at the individual level, whereas morality was the strongest predictor of self-esteem at the collective level.

98,Mortality salience and worldview affirmation strengthen support for foreign products,"Research in terror management theory shows that, when reminded of their own death, people experience an elevated need to feel secure in their cultural worldview. This effect has consequences for consumer behavior. One unexplored possibility is that a worldview-affirming prime will buffer anxiety and actually increase willingness to purchase products representative of a foreign worldview after a death reminder. In our study, we first induced mortality or failure salience in 137 Austrian residents. Participants then read a diary entry about a holiday spent either in the mountains of Austria or in foreign countries. Finally, we measured willingness to pay a higher price for a local ('Fair Milk') versus a foreign product ('fair trade'). Analyses showed that following mortality salience (compared to failure salience) the worldview-affirming prime (a diary entry about Austrian culture) uniquely increased willingness to pay higher prices for foreign products.

99,Bored like Hell: Religiosity reduces boredom and tempers the quest for meaning,"Boredom involves a lack meaning. Conversely, religiosity offers people a sense of meaning. Accordingly, we proposed that by imbuing a sense of meaningfulness, religiosity leads people to experience less boredom. Furthermore, we hypothesized and tested that by reducing boredom, religiosity indirectly inhibits the search for meaningful engagement. In Study 1, following boring tasks, religious people experienced lower levels of boredom and were less motivated to search for meaning than nonreligious people. We found in Study 2 that religious (vs. non- or less religious) people reported higher perceived meaning in life, which was associated with a reduced tendency to feel bored, and with a reduced need to search for meaning in life. Study 3 confirmed that the meaning in life associated with religiosity was associated with reduced state boredom. Religious participants were again less inclined to search for meaning, which was explained by the relatively low levels of boredom that religious (vs. nonreligious) participants experienced.

The authors would like to thank Goran Knežević for his significant contribution to the back translation of the {VAST} and Ashley Lauren Watts for providing the procedure for calculating the D statistic. The authors regret any inconvenience or confusion this error may have caused.] The aim of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of three sadism scales: Short Sadistic Impulse Scale ({SSIS}), Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies ({VAST}, which measures direct and vicarious sadism), and Assessment of Sadistic Personality ({ASP}). Sample included 443 participants (50.1\% men) from the general population. Reliability based on internal consistency of all scales was good, and results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis ({CFA}) showed that all three scales had acceptable fit indices for the proposed structure. Results of Item Response Theory ({IRT}) analysis showed that all three scales had higher measurement precision (information) in above-average scores. Validity of the scales was supported through moderate to high positive correlations with the Dark Triad traits, especially psychopathy, as well as positive correlations with aggressiveness and negative with Honesty-Humility. Moreover, results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that all three measures of direct, but not vicarious sadism, contributed significantly above and beyond other Dark Triad traits to the prediction of increased positive attitudes toward dangerous social groups. The profile similarity index showed that the {SSIS} and the {ASP} were highly overlapping, while vicarious sadism seems distinct from other sadism scales.

101,Policy and procedure recommendations for the collection and preservation of eyewitness identification evidence,"Objective: The Executive Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) appointed a subcommittee to update the influential 1998 scientific review paper on guidelines for eyewitness identification procedures. Method: This was a collaborative effort by six senior eyewitness researchers, who all participated in the writing process. Feedback from members of {AP}-{LS} and the legal communities was solicited over an 18-month period. Results: The results yielded nine recommendations for planning, designing, and conducting eyewitness identification procedures. Four of the recommendations were from the 1998 article and concerned the selection of lineup fillers, prelineup instructions to witnesses, the use of double-blind procedures, and collection of a confidence statement. The additional five recommendations concern the need for law enforcement to conduct a prelineup interview of the witness, the need for evidence-based suspicion before conducting an identification procedure, video-recording of the entire procedure, avoiding repeated identification attempts with the same witness and same suspect, and avoiding the use of showups when possible and improving how showups are conducted when they are necessary. Conclusions: The reliability and integrity of eyewitness identification evidence is highly dependent on the procedures used by law enforcement for collecting and preserving the eyewitness evidence. These nine recommendations can advance the reliability and integrity of the evidence.

102,The art of influence: When and why deviant artists gain impact,"Some artists rise to fame, while others sink into oblivion. What determines whether artists make an impact? Considering deviance in its sociohistorical context, we propose that artists whose work deviates from their own previous style (intrapersonal deviance) and other artists’ styles (interpersonal deviance) gain greater impact than nondeviant artists, as long as deviance is directed toward a progressive style. A preliminary study showed that in western cultures nonrealistic styles are considered more progressive than realistic styles (Study 1). Five more studies provide evidence for the effects of the two types of artistic deviance on several aspects of impact (i.e., perceived influence of the artist, valuation of the artwork, and visual attention to the artwork). First, individuals considered artists who deviated from their previous style more impactful than artists who consistently followed a single style (Study 2), effects that were stronger when artists transitioned from a retrogressive style to a progressive one (Study 3). Second, artists who deviated from their contemporaries’ style were considered more impactful than artists who followed the predominant style, effects that were stronger when artists strayed from a predominant retrogressive style by using progressive means of expression (Studies 4 and 5). When the historical context prevented observers from inferring the progressiveness of the deviant artists’ expressive means, artistic deviance enhanced perceived impact regardless of the means by which the artists deviated (Study 6). Supporting our theoretical model, the effects of intrapersonal and interpersonal deviance on impact were mediated by perceived will-power (Studies 3, 5, and 6).

103,Terror management and civic engagement: An experimental investigation of effects of mortality salience on civic engagement intentions,"Stories of death flood the media, making mortality a salient theme in American news. Research shows that subconscious reminders of death influence a range of behaviors associated with charitable giving and a bolstered sense of patriotism (Burke, Martens, \& Faucher, 2010, Personality \& Social Psychology Review, 14, 155–195). Terror management theory ({TMT}) explains this relationship by positing that subconscious mortality salience motivates individuals to embrace their cultural worldviews (e.g., engaging in volunteerism or politically oriented activities). Moreover, collectivistic, relative to individualistic, self-construals motivate individuals to serve others and meet group needs. In a first-known attempt to understand the relationship between {TMT}, self-construals, and civic engagement, a 2 (mortality salience: high or low) × 2 (self-construal: individualistic or collectivistic) experiment (N = 124) revealed that counter to common findings, increased mortality salience was negatively related to civic engagement intentions. However, as predicted, collectivism was positively associated with such intentions. Results also indicated that mortality salience and self-construals may not interact to influence civic engagement.

104,Compensatory control and the appeal of a structured world,"People are motivated to perceive themselves as having control over their lives. Consequently, they respond to events and cognitions that reduce control with compensatory strategies for restoring perceived control to baseline levels. Prior theory and research have documented 3 such strategies: bolstering personal agency, affiliating with external systems perceived to be acting on the self’s behalf, and affirming clear contingencies between actions and outcomes within the context of reduced control (here termed specific structure). We propose a 4th strategy: affirming nonspecific structure, or seeking out and preferring simple, clear, and consistent interpretations of the social and physical environments. Formulating this claim suggests that people will respond to reduced control by affirming structured interpretations that are unrelated to the control-reducing condition, and even those that entail otherwise adverse outcomes (e.g., pessimistic health prospects). Section 1 lays the conceptual foundation for our review, situating the proposed phenomenon in the literatures on control motivation and threat-compensation mechanisms. Section 2 reviews studies that have demonstrated that trait and state variations in perceived control predict a wide range of epistemic structuring tendencies, including pattern recognition and causal reasoning. We posit that these tendencies reflect a common desire for a structured understanding of one’s environment. Accordingly, a new meta-analysis spanning the reviewed studies (k = 55) revealed that control reduction predicts nonspecific structure affirmation with a moderate effect size (r = .25). Section 3 reviews research on individual differences and situational moderators of this effect. The discussion addresses the interplay of compensatory control strategies and practical implications.

105,The approach-motivational nature of reactance—Evidence from asymmetrical frontal cortical activation,"Research has demonstrated that freedom restrictions evoke psychological reactance—a strong motivation to take action to regain the threatened freedom. We hypothesized that the underlying motivational state of reactance is approach-related. We used either a behavioral measure (line bisection task) or electroencephalography to assess relative left frontal brain activation, an indicator of approach motivation. We found increased approach motivation following imagined (Experiment 1), remembered (Experiment 2), and induced (Experiment 3) freedom threats. The results additionally revealed that only a self-experienced freedom threat and not a vicarious freedom threat resulted in approach motivation. Overall, the findings suggest that reactance is approach motivational.

106,Is religiousness a unique predictor of self-esteem? An empirical investigation with a diverse Israeli sample,"The current investigation aimed to test the relationship between religiousness and self-esteem. Religiousness was measured comprehensively by four indices (i.e., religious participation, positive religious coping, fundamentalism, optimistic afterlife beliefs). In addition, the study examined the key question of whether the relationships between the different indices of religiousness and self-esteem persist after controlling for the potential confounding variable dispositional optimism. The study utilized a cross-sectional design and a sample of Israeli adults (N = 451) from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds. The findings revealed weak positive zero-order correlations between all indices of religiousness and self-esteem. However, none of these indices remained predictive of self-esteem when they were entered into the regression model alongside dispositional optimism. This was true both for the sample as a whole, and for Muslim and Jewish individuals, as well as secular, traditional, and religious individuals, separately. Furthermore, dispositional optimism fully mediated the links between all religious indices and self-esteem. The findings suggest that, at least in the specific sociocultural context in which this research was conducted, religiousness does not add a unique variance in predicting self-esteem, and its link to self-esteem can be explained by nonreligious variables.

107,"Evaluating experts may serve psychological needs: Self-esteem, bias blind spot, and processing fluency explain confirmation effect in assessing financial advisors’ authority","When making financial decisions, people often use recommendations from professional advisors. However, before doing so, they must first recognize whether the experts to whom they turn for advice are competent and trustworthy. In the present article, we show that decision-makers ascribe greater authority to those financial advisors whose recommendations confirm their own opinions. We document that this confirmation effect in perceiving financial experts’ authority holds for two financial products (investment accounts and health savings accounts) and three different cultures (United States, Poland, and the United Kingdom). Most importantly, we found that the effect might be due to three distinct psychological mechanisms: self-esteem, bias blind spot, and processing fluency. The results presented in this project indicate that receiving financial advice consistent with one’s own beliefs (compared to advice inconsistent with those beliefs) is related to higher evaluations of one’s own competence in finances, higher self-esteem, and perceiving advisors as less biased and with better processing fluency, which in turn lead to ascribing greater epistemic authority to financial experts.

108,Suicide and dominant masculinity norms among current and former United States military servicemen,"Recent statistics suggest current and former United States military personnel are at a greater risk for suicide than ever before. Indeed, approximately 300 active-duty servicemen died by suicide in 2009, a population-adjusted death rate exceeding that of civilians (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). Despite a growing body of literature highlighting the adverse consequences of men's adherence to traditional masculine norms on their physical and emotional health, little attention has been paid to the contributions of compliance with these norms on current and former male military personnel's risk for suicide. The present manuscript highlights the need for greater consideration of servicemen's adherence to norms of masculinity to better understand their suicide risk. To organize this presentation, the authors discuss how current and former servicemen's adherence to social and military injunctions for masculine behavior may contribute to an unwillingness to utilize mental health services that, in turn, exacerbates their mental health and may contribute to their risk for suicide. The authors also provide specific recommendations for gender-sensitive treatment interventions and future research.

109,Changing prosocial values following an existential threat as a function of political orientation: Understanding the effects of armed conflicts from a terror management perspective,"In two related studies, we explored the joint role of being exposed to existential threat and political orientation in explaining changes in prosocial values. Drawing on Schwartz's value theory and terror management theory, we suggested existential threat causes values change. Specifically, we hypothesized that following an actual or hypothetical threat, the importance of benevolence values, which focus on the welfare of close people, would increase. We further hypothesized that universalism values, which focus on the welfare of humanity, would become more or less important depending on political orientation. We tested our premises in a field study conducted in the context of a large military operation in Israel (Study 1: N = 105, 68.2\% female) and in an experiment (Study 2: N = 54, 85.5\% female) where we manipulated mortality salience. Following an armed conflict (Study 1) or a mortality salience manipulation (Study 2), those with left and right-wing inclinations showed different patterns of change in universalism. Benevolence increased in importance regardless of political orientation, but only in the experimental study (Study 2). We discuss the idea that defense mechanisms triggered by existential threats can explain different patterns of change in prosocial values following an armed conflict.

111,"Sanitizing history: National identification, negative stereotypes, and support for eliminating Columbus Day and adopting Indigenous Peoples Day","Objectives: Despite the fact that Christopher Columbus did not discover America and was arguably one of the most brutal colonizers in recorded history, the United States continues to celebrate a holiday in his honor. A growing movement by Native American activists and allies aims to adopt Indigenous Peoples Day in lieu of Columbus Day to shed light on historical inaccuracies, acknowledge the legacy of colonialism, and celebrate Indigenous Peoples. Research suggests that national narratives, such as those undergirding Columbus Day, build on negative stereotypes about minoritized groups to help bolster national identities. We examined whether national identification and negative stereotyping of Native Americans shapes support for each holiday. Method: We conducted 2 large-scale national studies (Study 1: college students, N = 4,625; Study 2: adults, N = 2,805). Results: Across both samples, people who endorsed the continued celebration of Columbus Day and people who were least supportive of adopting Indigenous Peoples Day were those high in national identification. In contrast, people who endorsed eliminating Columbus Day and people who supported adopting Indigenous Peoples Day were relatively low in national identification who also believed that negative stereotypes about Native Americans were highly unacceptable (Studies 1 and 2) and/or inaccurate (Study 2). Conclusions: The results suggest that garnering support for eliminating Columbus Day and adopting Indigenous Peoples Day requires interrogating the roots of national identification and rejecting negative stereotypes about Native Americans. Implications for why people continue to hold onto national narratives that reify the continued subordination of minority groups are discussed.

112,Disgust sensitivity predicts defensive responding to mortality salience,"Disgust protects the physical self. The present authors suggest that disgust also contributes to the protection of the psychological self by fostering stronger defensive reactions to existential concerns. To test this idea, 3 studies examined the link between disgust sensitivity and defensive responses to mortality salience or 'terror management' processes (Greenberg, Solomon, \& Pyszczynski, 1997). Each study included an individual difference measure of disgust sensitivity, a manipulation of mortality salience, and a dependent measure of defensive responding. In Study 1, disgust sensitivity predicted increases in worldview defense in the mortality salience condition but not in the control condition. In Study 2, disgust sensitivity predicted increases in optimistic perceptions of the future in the mortality salience condition but not in the control condition. In Study 3, disgust sensitivity predicted reductions in delay discounting for those in the mortality salience condition such that those higher in disgust sensitivity discounted the future less. This pattern did not occur in the control condition. These findings highlight disgust sensitivity as a key to understanding reactions to mortality salience, and they support the view that disgust-related responses protect against both physical (e.g., noxious substances) and psychological threats.

113,Focusing on the nonreligious reveals secular mechanisms underlying well-being and prosociality,"Greater attention to secular and nonreligious individuals has provided much-needed balance as well as alternative interpretations of commonly held assumptions regarding religiosity/spirituality (R/S). Contrary to the theory that R/S provides unique benefits in areas such as prosociality and mental health, analogous secular mechanisms exist. The conflation of effects attributed to R/S together with secular effects represents a congruence fallacy. Studies often lack proper controls found in other areas of psychology (e.g., dismantling or placebo designs) that could detect when religion is acting as a proxy for more basic underlying influences. For example, an increased focus on the nonreligious has revealed that religious belief has often been confounded with factors such as strong worldview conviction, social engagement, and normative cultural fit. R/S differences co-occur with demographic, personality, cognitive, and epistemic variables that exert causal influence independent of any religious content. Experimental and treatment outcome studies featuring effects attributed to R/S often have not included equivalent secular conditions or stimuli. The association between spirituality and well-being has been artificially inflated because of conceptual blurring on assessment measures, leading to the miscategorization of some nonreligious individuals into the spirituality domain. In sum, a more specified and critical approach is needed in order to validate assumptions that religiosity and spirituality exert unique effects.

114,'A flaw in the great diamond of the world': Reflections on subjectivity and the enterprise of psychology (A diptych),"In this article, I consider the problematic nature of human subjectivity, which the philosopher Merleau-Ponty (borrowing from poet Paul Valéry) referred to as the 'flaw in the great diamond of the world.' We are 'self-interpreting animals' who largely create ourselves through our own modes of self-understanding, yet our own subjectivity remains enigmatic even to ourselves. I consider, in light of these facts, the status of several dominant ways of conceptualizing human existence in psychology and the psy professions: cognitive–behavioral theory, psychoanalysis, and especially existential-phenomenology. Before doing so, however, I first offer an historical sketch of the focus on subjectivity that began in the European Renaissance, notably through such figures as Shakespeare and Rembrandt. It is important to explore this advent of modern subjectivity, if only to remind us of what can be at risk in the course of cultural change. As psychologists, we are often preoccupied with practical or empirical issues. A key question to ask, however, is whether our field—which plays a formative role in contemporary culture—does sufficient justice to the forms of subjectivity and selfhood that came into focus or even into being during that crucial era of Western history.

115,Holding on to pieces of the past: Daily reports of nostalgia in a life-span sample,"Nostalgia, the fond remembrance of one’s past, is a common experience hypothesized to increase across the life span. Yet data on the specific features of nostalgia, such as daily frequency and associated affect, are scarce. This study sought to address this limitation by assessing the daily experience of nostalgia using experience-sampling methods. A life-span sample of 108 participants (47 young, 31 middle-aged, and 30 older adults) completed a 2-week, twice-daily experience-sampling study that yielded data describing the frequency and emotions of everyday nostalgia. Multilevel logistic regression analyses supported increased nostalgia frequency at every life stage: Young adults were 60\% less likely to report nostalgia compared with middle-aged adults (odds ratio [{OR}] = .40), whereas older adults were 3 times more likely than middle-aged adults to report nostalgia ({OR} = 3.05). Additionally, the experience of nostalgia was associated with significant heterogeneity in positive and negative affect. Approximately 72\% of participants experienced an increase in positive affect, and 51\% experienced an increase in negative affect. For young and middle-aged adults, a change in positive affect was associated with a 2-times-larger increase in nostalgia likelihood, whereas a change in negative affect was more strongly associated with a nostalgia experience in older adults. The current study provides increased evidence for the affectively mixed nature of nostalgia and how the affective pattern differs for adults of different ages. Greater nostalgia frequency may be instrumental during life review when individuals make meaning of their lives, fulfilling developmental goals of late adulthood.

116,"Seeing me, seeing you: Testing competing accounts of assumed similarity in personality judgments","A recurrent observation in personality judgments is that individuals’ ratings of others’ personalities are positively linked to their self-description, and that such 'assumed similarity' effects appear to be trait-specific. However, the extent of and explanations for assumed similarity have been addressed only insufficiently. To close this gap, we first provide a meta-analytic summary of evidence on assumed similarity of basic personality traits. More importantly, we then critically test different theoretical accounts of assumed similarity (i.e., lack of information, relation to personal values, and known/spurious similarity) in nine studies. Specifically, we investigated assumed similarity of the {HEXACO} personality traits among strangers, using tailored experimental tests tackling the different theoretical accounts. Across studies, we consistently found the strongest assumed similarity effects for those traits being most strongly linked to personal values: Honesty-Humility and (albeit somewhat weaker) Openness to Experience. For the remaining traits, no consistent evidence for assumed similarity occurred, even when raters had very limited information about the target person. This contradicts that assumed similarity reflects a lack-of-information effect. In turn, the findings could also neither be accounted for by actual similarity, nor by a shared group membership (i.e., spurious similarity) between rater and target. Overall, our studies support the idea that assumed similarity of basic traits is closely tied to personal values and suggest that this finding is attributable to the high personal relevance of value-related traits. This implies that assumed similarity reflects the assumption that others share basic parts of one’s identity, even if these others are complete strangers.

117,Benevolent creativity buffers anxiety aroused by mortality salience: Terror management in {COVID}-19 pandemic,"With the outbreak of the {COVID}-19 crisis, the public keeps getting epidemic-related information on the media. News reports on the increasing number of fatalities have exposed individuals to death, which causes negative emotional experiences such as tension, anxiety, and fear. This study aimed to investigate whether creativity could serve as an anxiety-buffer when mortality is salient. Based on previous findings, the present study utilized type of creative task and personal search for meaning as moderators. In Study 1, a 2 (mortality salience: absent, present) × 2 (type of creative task: benevolent, malevolent) between-subject design was utilized, and 168 subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. In Study 2, 221 subjects were recruited. The experimental procedure was similar to Study 1, except that the priming paradigm of mortality was changed and search for meaning was included as an additional moderating variable. State anxiety was measured as the dependent variable in both studies. Results of Study 1 showed that, while the benevolent creative task could buffer anxiety in the mortality salience condition, the malevolent creative task did not have the same effect. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between mortality salience, type of creative task, and search for meaning in life on anxiety. In Study 2, the buffering function of benevolent creativity was more intense for participants with a higher level of search for meaning. Together, these findings reveal the influence of different types of creative tasks on individual anxiety levels under death priming conditions and the moderating effect of search for meaning in this relationship. Further, they suggest the need to focus on the role of creativity in terror management.

118,Explicit and implicit disability attitudes of healthcare providers,"Purpose/Objective: Health care providers’ attitudes of marginalized groups can be key factors that contribute to health care access and outcome disparities because of their influence on patient encounters as well as clinical decision-making. Despite a growing body of knowledge linking disparate health outcomes to providers’ clinical decision making, less research has focused on providers’ attitudes about disability. The aim of this study was to examine providers’ explicit and implicit disability attitudes, interactions between their attitudes, and correlates of explicit and implicit bias. Research Method/Design: We analyzed secondary data from 25,006 health care providers about their disability attitudes. In addition to analyzing people’s explicit and implicit attitudes (Disability Attitudes Implicit Association Test), we used Son Hing, Chung-Yan, Hamilton, \& Zanna’s (2008) model of two-dimensional prejudice to compare provider’s explicit and implicit attitudes. Finally, we used linear regression models to examine correlates of providers’ explicit and implicit attitudes. Results: While on average, provider’s explicit attitudes (M = 4.41) indicated little prejudice, their implicit attitudes (M = 0.54) revealed they moderately preferred nondisabled people—they were aversive ableists. Correlates of providers’ explicit and implicit attitudes also included age, gender, political orientation, and having relationships with disability (friends, family, and being a person with disability). Conclusions/Implications: This study revealed that despite a majority of providers self-reporting not being biased against people with disabilities, implicitly, the overwhelming majority were biased. This study’s findings can be used to better understand how provider disability bias can contribute to inequitable health care access and health outcomes for people with disabilities.

119,Age-related differences in actual-ideal personality trait level discrepancies,"People differ from each other in their typical patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion and these patterns are considered to constitute their personalities (Funder, 2001). For various reasons, for example, because certain trait levels may help to attain certain goals or fulfill certain social roles, people may experience that their actual trait levels are different from their ideal trait levels. In this study, we investigated (a) the impact of age on discrepancies between actual and ideal Big Five personality trait levels and (b) the impact of these discrepancies on personality trait changes across a period of 2 years. We use data of a large, nationally representative, and age-diverse sample (N = 4,057, 17–94 years, M = 53 years). Results largely confirmed previously reported age effects on actual personality trait levels but were sometimes more complex. Ideal trait levels exceeded actual trait levels more strongly for younger compared with older adults. Unexpectedly, neither ideal trait levels nor their interaction with beliefs about the extent to which personality is malleable versus fixed predicted trait change over 2 years (controlling for actual trait levels). We conclude that ideal-actual trait level discrepancies may provide an impetus for change but that they appear to neither alone nor in combination with the belief that personality trait change is possible suffice to produce such change. We discuss commitment, self-efficacy, and strategy knowledge as potential additional predictors of trait change.

120,Exploring the existential function of religion: The effect of religious fundamentalism and mortality salience on faith-based medical refusals,"Decisions to rely on religious faith over medical treatment for health conditions represent an important but understudied phenomenon. In an effort to understand some of the psychological underpinnings of such decisions, the present research builds from terror management theory to examine whether reminders of death motivate individuals strongly invested in a religious worldview (i.e., fundamentalists) to rely on religious beliefs when making medical decisions. The results showed that heightened concerns about mortality led those high in religious fundamentalism to express greater endorsement of prayer as a medical substitute (Study 1) and to perceive prayer as a more effective medical treatment (Study 2). Similarly, high fundamentalists were more supportive of religiously motivated medical refusals (Study 3) and reported an increased willingness to rely on faith alone for medical treatment (Study 4) following reminders of death. Finally, affirmations of the legitimacy of divine intervention in health contexts functioned to solidify a sense of existential meaning among fundamentalists who were reminded of personal mortality (Study 5). The existential importance of religious faith and the health-relevant implications of these findings are discussed.

122,Death salience moderates the effect of trauma on religiosity,"Objective: Previous research has shown contradictory evidence for the relationship between religiosity and trauma; exposure to traumatic life events has been associated with both increases and decreases in religiosity over time. On the basis of a long theoretical tradition of linking death and religious belief and recent empirical evidence that thoughts of death may increase religiosity, we tested whether one determinant of trauma’s influence on religion is the degree to which it makes death salient. Method: Using longitudinal data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a unique population-representative birth cohort, we tested whether the relationship between trauma and religiosity depends on whether the trauma involves death. Participants reported their private, ceremonial, and public religious behaviors at ages 26 and 32 and, at age 32, whether they had experienced any of 23 traumatic life events since age 26. Results: Experiencing the death of a loved one (but not an equally traumatic event not involving death) predicted a future increase in private religious behavior (e.g., prayer) among those already practicing such behaviors, and an increase in the importance of religious ceremonies among those with relatively little prior interest in them. On the other hand, experiencing a death-unrelated trauma predicted a future reduction in public displays of religiosity among those previously so inclined. Conclusion: The study represents a significant step in understanding religious responses to trauma, and emphasizes the importance of considering not only the nature of a trauma, but also the dimensions and practices of a victim’s religiosity prior to it.

123,An existential threat model of conspiracy theories,"People endorse conspiracy theories particularly when they experience existential threat, that is, feelings of anxiety or uncertainty often because of distressing societal events. At the same time, such feelings also often lead people to support groups frequently implicated in conspiracy theories (e.g., the government). The present contribution aims to resolve this paradox by proposing an Existential Threat Model of Conspiracy Theories, which stipulates under what conditions existential threat does versus does not stimulate conspiracy theories. The model specifically illuminates that feelings of existential threat increase epistemic sense-making processes, which in turn stimulate conspiracy theories only when antagonistic outgroups are salient. Moreover, once formed conspiracy theories are not functional to reduce feelings of existential threat; instead, conspiracy theories can be a source of existential threat in itself, stimulating further conspiracy theorizing and contributing to a generalized conspiracist mindset. In the discussion, I discuss implications of the model, and illuminate how one may base interventions on the model to breaks this cyclical process and reduce conspiracy beliefs.

124,A quiet ego quiets death anxiety: Humility as an existential anxiety buffer,"Five studies tested the hypothesis that a quiet ego, as exemplified by humility, would buffer death anxiety. Humility is characterized by a willingness to accept the self and life without comforting illusions, and by low levels of self-focus. As a consequence, it was expected to render mortality thoughts less threatening and less likely to evoke potentially destructive behavior patterns. In line with this reasoning, Study 1 found that people high in humility do not engage in self-serving moral disengagement following mortality reminders, whereas people low in humility do. Study 2 showed that only people low in humility respond to death reminders with increased fear of death, and established that this effect was driven uniquely by humility and not by some other related personality trait. In Study 3, a low sense of psychological entitlement decreased cultural worldview defense in response to death thoughts, whereas a high sense of entitlement tended to increase it. Study 4 demonstrated that priming humility reduces self-reported death anxiety relative to both a baseline and a pride priming condition. Finally, in Study 5, experimentally induced feelings of humility prevented mortality reminders from leading to depleted self-control. As a whole, these findings obtained from relatively diverse Internet samples illustrate that the dark side of death anxiety is brought about by a noisy ego only and not by a quiet ego, revealing self-transcendence as a sturdier, healthier anxiety buffer than self-enhancement.

125,Hot pursuit: The affective consequences of organization-set versus self-set goals for emotional exhaustion and citizenship behavior,"An unintended side effect of the goal-setting literature’s focus on cognitive dynamics has been an insufficient acknowledgment of how employees affectively experience high-performance goals. This is potentially a crucial oversight, considering the substantial body of research that has demonstrated the impact of employees’ affective states on organizationally relevant attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on cognitive–motivational–relational theory (Lazarus, 1991), we explore the discrete affective states elicited by high-performance goals. We suggest that a key to understanding these affective states is the source of the performance goal. The literature has largely considered whether goals are organization-set or self-set to be a peripheral aspect of a goal’s impact on employees. From an affective perspective, however, an employee’s self-set performance goals may be appraised and experienced quite differently than performance goals assigned by the organization. We build a theoretical model that suggests high organization-set goals will elicit anxiety due to an appraisal characterized by uncertainty and threat, whereas high self-set goals will elicit enthusiasm due to an appraisal characterized by positive expectations and benefit. We propose that these affective states will have diverging effects on employees’ emotional exhaustion and, subsequently, their extrarole performance. We support our model both in the field via a 4-wave study conducted with police officers and their supervisors and in the laboratory via an experiment in which we manipulated goal source during a performance task.

126,"Life history and the cultural evolution of parenting: Pathogens, mortality, and birth across the globe","Life history theory predicts that parents in adverse environments adopt faster reproductive strategies. Supporting this idea, a global study of more than 150 nations showed that in nations with higher pathogen loads, and thus higher infant mortality rates, the average woman begins having children at a younger age and gives birth to more children. These findings hold true after controlling for demographic variables such as national wealth (per capita {GDP}). Historical pathogen loads and recent infant mortality rates also predict changes in reproductive strategies over 6 decades. Furthermore, consistent with Schmitt (2005), nations in which women are in the statistical minority relative to men also exhibit slower reproductive strategies and higher parental investment. Presumably, this last finding is due to the greater social power women have in their marriages under such conditions. This report supports key predictions of life history theory and parental investment theory in the most comprehensive, methodologically rigorous global tests yet conducted.

127,An ecological-systemic approach to resilience: A view from the trenches,"This article is the edited transcript of an interview with Rony Berger by Charles Figley regarding trauma resilience. It is part of a special issue focusing on resilience and the results of a panel study. Because, as Berger has noted, resilience as a concept is a socially constructed and culturally bounded concept and saturated with political and ethical aspects, he provides examples. First, this article outlines the major components of both individual and community resilience factors, according to this author. Next, he broadens its scope with such markers as quality of life, values, and identity issues. Resilience, therefore, is not simply 'bouncing back to previous level of functioning,' it is a matter of incorporating trauma into their personal and collective narratives. Based on his many humanitarian trips, he is opposed to governments abdicating their responsibilities to their citizens by neglecting to establish a trauma preparedness program before major disasters strike. The author offers the following definition of a resilient society: 'The capacity of a community to deal with a major crisis by adapting and growing while minimizing casualties and preserving a fair quality of life for all its citizens and maintaining its core values and identity.'

128,Being present in the face of existential threat: The role of trait mindfulness in reducing defensive responses to mortality salience,"Terror management theory posits that people tend to respond defensively to reminders of death, including worldview defense, self-esteem striving, and suppression of death thoughts. Seven experiments examined whether trait mindfulness—a disposition characterized by receptive attention to present experience—reduced defensive responses to mortality salience ({MS}). Under {MS}, less mindful individuals showed higher worldview defense (Studies 1–3) and self-esteem striving (Study 5), yet more mindful individuals did not defend a constellation of values theoretically associated with mindfulness (Study 4). To explain these findings through proximal defense processes, Study 6 showed that more mindful individuals wrote about their death for a longer period of time, which partially mediated the inverse association between trait mindfulness and worldview defense. Study 7 demonstrated that trait mindfulness predicted less suppression of death thoughts immediately following {MS}. The discussion highlights the relevance of mindfulness to theories that emphasize the nature of conscious processing in understanding responses to threat.

Yet the explanations offered by Becker and Milgram are strikingly different. In this essay, brief biographical records of their lives are provided. Differences in their research methods and theories are then examined and traced to relevant differences in their lives, education, and careers. Especially important in this regard were their personal experiences of evil and the scholarly practices and traditions of social scientific and humanities scholarship that characterized their graduate education and scholarly work. The final parts of the essay are devoted to a comparative and integrative analysis of their respective approaches to the question of evil, especially as manifest during the Holocaust, and a brief exegesis of their disciplinary commitments.

130,From system acceptance to embracing alternative systems and system rejection: Tipping points in processes of radicalization,"This article focuses on the psychological process of radicalization and proposes a model that examines when people stop accepting the status quo and instead start embracing alternative social systems, unconventional worldviews, and countercultural norms and associated organizations. Specifically, complementary to earlier approaches, the article puts forward that emotional and behavioral system rejection are important in understanding growing radicalization. Building on literatures on social injustice, investment models, collective action theories, emotional reactions to injustice, the justification of violence, and system justification theory, the model proposes that perceptions of injustice are central to the process of radicalization. It is assumed that these perceptions can lead to system rejection tendencies of the dominant social system. That is, when there is no alternative system available, people can only show emotional system rejection. However, when an alternative system is available (such as when membership of a radical group or terrorist organization is a viable alternative), the scale may tip from emotional system rejection to behavioral system rejection, resulting in significantly higher levels of radicalization. In this way, the model identifies under what conditions tipping points may arise that can tilt people from system acceptance or emotional system rejection to active behavioral rejection of the societal system. Implications of this tipping point model are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Bal, Michèlle and van den Bos, Kees",0,,130
131,Desire to work as a death anxiety buffer mechanism,"Four studies were conducted to examine the death anxiety buffering function of work as a terror management mechanism, and the possible moderating role of culture. In Study 1, making mortality salient led to higher reports of participants’ desire to work. In Study 2, activating thoughts of fulfillment of the desire to work after mortality salience reduced the accessibility of death-related thoughts. In Study 3, activating thoughts of fulfillment of the desire to work reduced the effects of mortality salience on out-group derogation. In Study 4, priming thoughts about obstacles to the actualization of desire to work led to greater accessibility of death-related thoughts. Although two different cultures with contrasting work values were examined, the results were consistent, indicating that the desire to work serves as a death anxiety buffer mechanism in both cultures.

132,"Mortality salience, effort, and cardiovascular response to a bar‐press challenge: Remarkably nuanced effects of a death prime on heart performance","We presented participants with a bar‐pressing challenge relevant to their identity after having exposed them to a prime that made their mortality more or less salient. For some participants, difficulty was low; for others, it was high; for the rest, it was unfixed. As expected, heart pre‐ejection period responses—reflecting heart contraction force—were (a) stronger under high‐salience conditions when difficulty was high and unfixed, but (b) low regardless of salience when difficulty was low. Findings bear out conceptually and extend results from a previous experiment. In doing so, they add substantively to a new line of support for terror management theory and document the predictive utility of a proposed blended analysis of associated effort processes. The blended analysis speaks to the way in which motives to manage existential terror should convert into active goal striving and to the impact that existential threat might have on aspects of autonomic arousal.

134,"Homonegativity, perceived free speech protections, and perceptions of harm predict judgments of hateful acts motivated by sexual prejudice","Violence against sexual minorities is a significant public health concern; hate crime charges offer enhanced sentences for such acts in recognition of the injury that extends beyond the target to other members of the target’s group. The current work examined the relationship between homonegativity and judgments of criminal acts involving gay- versus heterosexual-targeted hate speech as hate crimes, as well as the factors that influence support for hate crime charges. Two potential factors are (a) perception of the act as protected by free speech rights, which enables justification of the act; and (b) perception of the harmfulness of the act, which is a key legal element in hate crime designations. Participants (N = 235) read about a criminal act targeting gay men or heterosexual persons. Participants low in homonegativity viewed the gay-targeted act as (a) more warranting a hate crime charge, (b) less protected by free speech rights, and (c) more harmful when compared to those high in homonegativity and when compared to those at all levels of homonegativity who read about a heterosexual-targeted act. Perceived harmfulness, but not perceived free speech protections, accounted for the interactive effect of participant homonegativity levels and act target on support for hate crime charges. Theoretical implications for understanding antigay attitudes and practical implications for the legal system and for current public discourse on the importance of free speech are discussed.

135,Belief in a just God (and a just society): A system justification perspective on religious ideology,"Theoretical approaches that treat religiosity as an evolutionary byproduct of cognitive mechanisms to detect agency may help to explain the prevalence of superstitious thinking, but they say little about the social–motivational (or ideological) functions of religious beliefs or the specific contents of religious doctrines. To address these omissions, we develop the thesis that religion provides an ideological justification for the existing social order, so that prevailing institutions and arrangements are perceived as legitimate and just, and therefore worth obeying and preserving. We summarize empirical evidence revealing that (a) religiosity is associated with the same set of epistemic, existential, and relational needs that motivate system justification; (b) religiosity is associated with the endorsement of the belief in a just world, Protestant work ethic, fair market ideology, opposition to equality, right-wing authoritarianism, political conservatism, and other system-justifying belief systems; and (c) religious ideology appears to serve the palliative function of making people happier or more satisfied with the way things are. Although most major religious texts and movements contain progressive as well as conservative elements, belief in God is more often than not system-justifying in terms of its motivational antecedents, manifestations, and consequences.

136,Empathetic collective angst predicts perpetrator group members’ support for the empowerment of the victimized group,"Although victimized groups have a need to recover diminished power, perpetrator groups are often reluctant to support actions that may undermine their own systemic advantages. We hypothesized that perpetrator group members’ experience of empathetic collective angst—a group-based emotion focused on concern for the future vitality of an outgroup—mediates the relation between the perception of threat to the future of the victimized group and support for policies that may satisfy the group’s empowerment. Across 5 studies and 3 distinct intergroup contexts (victimization of Aboriginal Canadians by non-Aboriginal Canadians, Native Americans by non-Native Americans, and French Canadians by Anglophone Canadians), we showed that perpetrator group members who perceive (Study 1) or are manipulated to perceive (Studies 2–5) that the victimized group is under existential threat (vs. secure) experience greater empathetic collective angst for the victimized group. In no study did perceived existential threat to the victimized group influence collective guilt—a group-based emotion focused on illegitimate harms committed against an outgroup. Empathetic collective angst mediated the relation between perceived existential threat and support for victimized group empowerment (e.g., self-determination). Study 4 found that the relation between empathetic collective angst and support for victimized group empowerment was stronger among perpetrator group members than bystander group members. A synthesis of the findings showed that the indirect effect was statistically significant across studies. Results suggest that, in the aftermath of victimization, empathetic collective angst motivates perpetrator group members to support policies that may satisfy victims’ power needs.

137,The regulating role of mindfulness in enacted workplace incivility: An experience sampling study,"Incivility at work poses a problem, both for individuals who are the targets of incivility and for organizations. However, relatively little is known about what drives or hinders individuals to engage in incivility, and how they respond to their own uncivil behavior. Adopting a self-regulation perspective, we link theories explaining enacted incivility as self-regulatory failure with research about the self-regulatory benefits of mindfulness. We develop and investigate a conceptual model on the role of trait mindfulness in antecedent- and consequent-based processes of enacted workplace incivility. Data from an experience-sampling study across 5 work days provided support for the majority of our hypotheses. Individuals high in trait mindfulness not only showed generally low levels of enacted incivility, but they also displayed less variability in enacted incivility over time. Specifically, while enacted incivility was entrained to the work week and systematically decreased from Monday to Friday for individuals low in mindfulness, enacted incivility remained stable over the course of the work week for individuals high in mindfulness. Furthermore, employees high in trait mindfulness reacted in a more morally mature manner and experienced guilt when having engaged in uncivil behavior compared to their low mindful counterparts. However, increases in guilt for high mindful individuals did not translate into lower levels of enacted incivility the following work day.

138,Terror management and attitudes toward immigrants: Differential effects of mortality salience for low and high right-wing authoritarians,"Previous terror management theory research has shown that mortality salience ({MS}; a death reminder) leads to the derogation of those who are perceived to be threats to or violators of one’s cultural worldview. Immigrants may be viewed as such a threat, but not necessarily to all majority group members of the culture. The studies presented here tested the hypothesis that, depending upon the nature of the participants’ worldview, {MS} would either increase or decrease liking of an immigrant. After being reminded of their mortality or a control topic, French and American college students evaluated an immigrant. To assess differences in worldview, participants completed a measure of right-wing authoritarianism ({RWA}). Consistent across two studies, {MS} led to more negative evaluations of an immigrant among those high in {RWA}, but more positive evaluations for those low in {RWA}. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for understanding the interplay of mortality concerns and {RWA} in determining attitudes toward immigrants.

139,Drawing attention to global climate change decreases support for war,"Three studies showed that focus on the shared human threat of global climate change can encourage peaceful coexistence and discourage support for war in the face of existential threat. In Study 1, mortality salience ({MS}) increased Americans' support for international peace-building after imagining the consequences of global climate change, but not after imagining a localized catastrophe. Conversely, in Study 2, {MS} increased Americans' support for war against Iran after imagining a localized catastrophe, but imagining global climate change completely eliminated this effect. Study 3 was conducted among Arab citizens of Israel during the January 2009 Israeli invasion of Gaza. For those high in perceptions of shared humanity, {MS} increased support for peaceful coexistence with Israeli Jews after imagining global climate change but not a localized catastrophe that would affect both Muslims and Jews. Taken together, these studies suggest that reminders of global climate change short-circuit the increased support for violence that often occurs in response to existential threat and increase support for peaceful reconciliation.

140,Existentially threatening stimuli increase religious cognitive dissonance among the less intrinsically religious,"Religion is a primary coping resource during adversity. However, at such times, people can experience dissonance in their religious attitudes and experience. For example, people of varying religiousness may differ in how they view God doctrinally and experience God relationally (i.e., head–heart discrepancy), especially when navigating existentially threatening situations. An experiment (N = 149) examined whether the centrality of religious belief—as indicated by intrinsic religiousness—moderated the effects of existentially threatening stimuli (e.g., disaster video footage) on religious cognitive dissonance. Results revealed that exposure to existentially threatening stimuli increased head–heart discrepancy regarding God’s benevolence among participants low in intrinsic religiousness. Those for whom religion is central appear to be better suited to integrating existentially threatening situations into their belief systems in ways that do not elicit religious cognitive dissonance and thereby help them maintain psychological equanimity.

141,Political psycholinguistics: A comprehensive analysis of the language habits of liberal and conservative social media users,"For nearly a century social scientists have sought to understand left–right ideological differences in values, motives, and thinking styles. Much progress has been made, but—as in other areas of research—this work has been criticized for relying on small and statistically unrepresentative samples and the use of reactive, self-report measures that lack ecological validity. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we employed automated text analytic methods to investigate the spontaneous, naturally occurring use of language in nearly 25,000 Twitter users. We derived 27 hypotheses from the literature on political psychology and tested them using 32 individual dictionaries. In 23 cases, we observed significant differences in the linguistic styles of liberals and conservatives. For instance, liberals used more language that conveyed benevolence, whereas conservatives used more language pertaining to threat, power, tradition, resistance to change, certainty, security, anger, anxiety, and negative emotion in general. In 17 cases, there were also significant effects of ideological extremity. For instance, moderates used more benevolent language, whereas extremists used more language pertaining to inhibition, tentativeness, affiliation, resistance to change, certainty, security, anger, anxiety, negative affect, swear words, and death-related language. These research methods, which are easily adaptable, open up new and unprecedented opportunities for conducting unobtrusive research in psycholinguistics and political psychology with large and diverse samples.

142,Temporal individual differences and creativity: An exploratory investigation,"Creativity is a temporally laden construct. However, the role of time remains an understudied concept with creativity, especially with how people differ in the ways they think about time. We explore the role these individual differences, called temporal individual differences, have with creativity, offering initial hypotheses for four traits: time urgency, pacing style, temporal focus, and polychronicity. We examined whether these traits relate to creativity similarly across multiple domains, different conceptualizations of creativity, and whether these relationships are linear or curvilinear. Adults from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (N = 214) completed a number of temporal individual difference measures, three conceptualizations of creativity (self-perceptions, activity, and achievement), and Big Five traits. The results indicate that temporal traits did not differentially relate to creativity across domains, but did with regard to different conceptualizations of creativity. These relationships were both linear and curvilinear, depending on the temporal trait. The results highlight that temporal individual differences impact creativity in unique ways, warranting further investigation.

143,Asians and Asian Americans’ experiences of racial discrimination during the {COVID}-19 pandemic: Impacts on health outcomes and the buffering role of social support,"Reports of racially discriminatory behaviors toward Asians in the United States have surged during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The current study examined self-reported racial discrimination toward Asians and Asian Americans living in the United States in relation to four mental and physical health outcomes: anxiety, depressive, and physical symptoms and sleep difficulties. The moderating role of social support was also examined. In addition, participants were asked to describe a specific instance of discrimination that had happened during the pandemic. Four hundred ten participants (Mage = 26.5 years, {SD} = 7.8; 47\% female) responded via online survey from all across from the country. Nearly 30\% reported an increase in discrimination since the pandemic, and over 40\% reported an increase in anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep difficulties. The four multiple regressions were each significant, with higher levels of discrimination and lower levels of social support predicting more health problems for each outcome. Social support significantly buffered the effect of discrimination on depressive symptoms and marginally buffered the effect on physical symptoms. Conventional content analysis was used to identify multiple themes within the three broad categories of personal experiences with discrimination, experiences with a stigmatizing anti-Asian racist culture, and prevention of exposure to discrimination. Results indicate that Asians have experienced elevated racial discrimination during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, including hate crimes, microaggressions, and vicarious discrimination, and these experiences are associated with poorer self-reported mental and physical health.

144,Religion vs the welfare state—the importance of cultural context for religious schematicity and priming,"Prior research, using correlational and self-report methodologies, suggests that religion and public welfare function as alternate security/insurance systems. Consequently, in countries with more expansive public welfare systems people report less religiosity. The present studies expand this field by utilizing experimental methodology and by replicating and extending two previous experiments in both a secular/welfare state context (Sweden) and a religious/nonwelfare state context (the United States). In the first set of experiments, we tested if cognitive access to religious and welfare-related mental schemas differ depending on context. We also tested whether previous findings indicating that people cognitively turn to religion when exposed to threat replicate and extend to the welfare system. In the second set of experiments, we tested whether religious and welfare reminders lead to increased risk taking in these contexts. Our findings show that participants in the secular/welfare state context had lower cognitive access to religious schemas and were less willing to take risks after religious reminders. However, our findings did not replicate those from previous studies; our participants did not have increased cognitive access to religion, nor public welfare, after threat primes. Similarly, our participants were generally not more prone to risk taking after reminders of religion (or public welfare), although such an effect was obtained specifically on high-religious participants. We conclude that cultural context is important to consider when studying psychological functions of religion, and we suggest that the failed replications may be due to cultural, contextual factors. Finally, religious reminders may have contradictory influences on risk taking.

145,Terror management and religion: Evidence that intrinsic religiousness mitigates worldview defense following mortality salience,"Terror management theory suggests that people cope with awareness of death by investing in some kind of literal or symbolic immortality. Given the centrality of death transcendence beliefs in most religions, the authors hypothesized that religious beliefs play a protective role in managing terror of death. The authors report three studies suggesting that affirming intrinsic religiousness reduces both death-thought accessibility following mortality salience and the use of terror management defenses with regard to a secular belief system. Study 1 showed that after a naturally occurring reminder of mortality, people who scored high on intrinsic religiousness did not react with worldview defense, whereas people low on intrinsic religiousness did. Study 2 specified that intrinsic religious belief mitigated worldview defense only if participants had the opportunity to affirm their religious beliefs. Study 3 illustrated that affirmation of religious belief decreased death-thought accessibility following mortality salience only for those participants who scored high on the intrinsic religiousness scale. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that only those people who are intrinsically vested in their religion derive terror management benefits from religious beliefs.

147,The role of control motivation in mortality salience effects on ingroup support and defense,"Terror management research has shown that mortality salience ({MS}) leads to increased support and defense of cultural ingroups and their norms (i.e., worldview defense, {WD}). The authors investigated whether these effects can be understood as efforts to restore a generalized sense of control by strengthening one's social ingroup. In Studies 1-3, the authors found that {WD} was only increased following pure death salience, compared with both dental pain salience and salience of self-determined death. As both the pure death and the self-determined death conditions increased accessibility of death-related thoughts (Study 4), these results do not emerge because only the pure death induction makes death salient. At the same time, Study 5 showed that implicitly measured control motivation was increased in the pure death salience condition but not under salience of both self-determined death and dental pain. Finally, in Study 6, the authors manipulated {MS} and control salience ({CS}) independently and found a main effect for {CS} but not for {MS} on {WD}.

Specifically, the current theory describes military training and culture focused on promoting survival and mission completion through developing an effective, context-relevant cognitive-appraisal system. The same useful cynical social-cognitive-affective appraisal processes that promote instinctive decisions and behaviors in combat environments also serve as a distal defense in the wake of combat experience by providing a meaning-making lens, in-group cohesion among fellow combat veterans, and cognitive clarity amid social-reintegration obstacles. Maladaptive consequences of postcombat cynicism are also detailed, emphasizing dynamic interactions associated with psychopathology, meaningful living, social relationships, economic disparity, and engagement in the health-care system. Conclusions focus on applications of this perspective in treatment in addition to future research directions. The ultimate goal of our perspective is to re-purpose cynicism from its traditional operationalization in personality psychology to provide a clinically useful and empowering conceptualization that can improve the lives of struggling {OEF}/{OIF}/{OND} veterans.

149,Screening for dark personalities: The Short Dark Tetrad ({SD}4),"Consensus is emerging that the constellation of dark personalities should include the sadistic personality. To build a four-factor measure, we modified and extended the Short Dark Triad ({SD}3) measure to include sadism. A series of three studies yielded the Short Dark Tetrad ({SD}4), a four subscale inventory with 7 items per construct. Study 1 (N = 868) applied exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) to a diverse 48-item pool using data collected on {MTurk}. A 4-factor solution revealed a separate sadism factor, as well as a shifted Dark Triad. Study 2 (N = 999 students) applied {EFA} to a reduced 37-item set. Associations with adjustment and sex drive provided insight into unique personality dynamics of the four constructs. In Study 3 (N = 660), a confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) of the final 28 items showed acceptable fit for a four-factor solution. Moreover, the resulting 7-item subscales each showed coherent links with the Big Five and adjustment. In sum, the four-factor structure replicated across student and community samples. Although they overlap to a moderate degree, the four subscales show distinctive correlates – even with a control for acquiescence. We also uncovered a novel link between sadism and sexuality, but no association with maladjustment.

150,Religiosity and perceived religious discrimination as predictors of support for suicide attacks among Muslim Americans,"Some argue that religiosity is one of the main causes of religious extremist violence, such as suicide attacks, while others propose that adverse circumstances associated with religiosity like perceived religious discrimination are responsible. Directly comparing these two perspectives, we investigated how religiosity (personal importance of religion, prayer frequency, religious service attendance, religious fundamentalism) and perceived religious discrimination predict support for suicide attacks in 2 samples of Muslim Americans (N₁ = 1,050; N₂ = 1,033). We found that most participants did not support religious extremist violence. Perceived religious discrimination, but no aspect of religiosity, was associated with increased support for suicide attacks. Therefore, support for suicide attacks among Muslim Americans does not seem to be predicted by religiosity but, rather, by perceived religious discrimination, which might be experienced at a greater rate by religious minorities. Reducing discrimination might be an effective general strategy to prevent religious radicalization.

151,Developing an evidence-based perspective on interrogation: A review of the {US} government’s high-value detainee interrogation group research program,"Interrogation practices in the United States have been roundly criticized both for their accusatorial ethos, at times leading to false confessions by the innocent, and for a history of applying physical and psychological coercion in law enforcement, military, and intelligence contexts. Despite decades of psychological research demonstrating the failures of such approaches and despite recent positive advances in countries such as the United Kingdom moving to an information-gathering framework, little change has occurred in the training or practice of U.S. interrogation professionals over the past 50 years. This article describes recent historical events that have led to the development of the first unclassified, government-funded research program on the science of interviewing and interrogation. Since 2010, the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group ({HIG}) research program has identified effective approaches for developing cooperation and rapport, eliciting information, challenging inconsistencies by presenting evidence or information strategically, and assessing credibility using cognitive cues and strategic questioning tactics. The program has also examined the influence of culture and language, and has facilitated the translation of research from the laboratory to the field. In this context, we review the significant contributions of psychologists to understanding and developing ethical, legal, and effective interrogation practices, and we describe important future directions for research on investigative interviewing and interrogation.

152,Increasing skepticism toward potential liars: Effects of existential threat on veracity judgments and the moderating role of honesty norm activation,"With the present research, we investigated effects of existential threat on veracity judgments. According to several meta-analyses, people judge potentially deceptive messages of other people as true rather than as false (so-called truth bias). This judgmental bias has been shown to depend on how people weigh the error of judging a true message as a lie (error 1) and the error of judging a lie as a true message (error 2). The weight of these errors has been further shown to be affected by situational variables. Given that research on terror management theory has found evidence that mortality salience ({MS}) increases the sensitivity toward the compliance of cultural norms, especially when they are of focal attention, we assumed that when the honesty norm is activated, {MS} affects judgmental error weighing and, consequently, judgmental biases. Specifically, activating the norm of honesty should decrease the weight of error 1 (the error of judging a true message as a lie) and increase the weight of error 2 (the error of judging a lie as a true message) when mortality is salient. In a first study, we found initial evidence for this assumption. Furthermore, the change in error weighing should reduce the truth bias, automatically resulting in better detection accuracy of actual lies and worse accuracy of actual true statements. In two further studies, we manipulated {MS} and honesty norm activation before participants judged several videos containing actual truths or lies. Results revealed evidence for our prediction. Moreover, in Study 3, the truth bias was increased after {MS} when group solidarity was previously emphasized.

153,Terrorism—A (self) love story: Redirecting the significance quest can end violence,"Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s concepts of self-love (amour propre) and love of self (amour de soi même) are applied to the psychology of terrorism. Self-love is concern with one’s image in the eyes of respected others, members of one’s group. It denotes one’s feeling of personal significance, the sense that one’s life has meaning in accordance with the values of one’s society. Love of self, in contrast, is individualistic concern with self-preservation, comfort, safety, and the survival of self and loved ones. We suggest that self-love defines a motivational force that when awakened arouses the goal of a significance quest. When a group perceives itself in conflict with dangerous detractors, its ideology may prescribe violence and terrorism against the enemy as a means of significance gain that gratifies self-love concerns. This may involve sacrificing one’s self-preservation goals, encapsulated in Rousseau’s concept of love of self. The foregoing notions afford the integration of diverse quantitative and qualitative findings on individuals’ road to terrorism and back. Understanding the significance quest and the conditions of its constructive fulfillment may be crucial to reversing the current tide of global terrorism.

154,Mind-body dualism and health revisited: How belief in dualism shapes health behavior,"Does a sound mind require a sound body? Whether or not lay people subscribe to this notion depends on their belief in mind-body dualism and critically shapes their health-related behaviors. Six studies (N = 1,710) revisit the relation between dualism and health. We replicate the negative correlation between belief in dualism and health behavior (Study 1) and extend it to behavior in the field (Study 2). Studies 3a and 3b investigate how belief in dualism shapes intuitions about the material origin of psychological well-being, while Studies 4a and 4b examine how these intuitions determine health-related outcomes. In sum, construing minds as different from bodies entails the intuition that mental well-being has little material substrate which in turn attenuates health-sustaining behaviors.

155,God rest our hearts: Religiosity and cognitive reappraisal,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 19(7) of Emotion (see record [rid]2019-57835-001[/rid]). In the article, in Table 1, an asterisk indicating statistical significance (p =.047) should have been included to indicate statistical significance of the correlation between religiosity and age. In Study 2A, participants were 57\% female (rather than 54\%). In Study 2B, participants were 48\% female (rather than 52\%). In Table 6, the mean reappraisal frequency was 4.68 (rather than 5.68). In Study 4, findings for motivation to regulate should have been Ms=4.35 vs. 3.01 (rather than Ms=4.36 vs. 3.03).] Although religiosity is often accompanied by more intense emotions, we propose that people who are more religious may be better at using 1 of the most effective emotion regulation strategies—namely, cognitive reappraisal. We argue that religion, which is a meaning-making system, is linked to better cognitive reappraisal, which involves changing the meaning of emotional stimuli. Four studies (N = 2,078) supported our hypotheses. In Study 1, religiosity was associated with more frequent use of cognitive reappraisal in 3 distinct religions (i.e., Islam, Christianity, Judaism). In Studies 2A–2B, we replicated these findings using 2 indices of cognitive reappraisal and in a large representative sample. In Studies 3–4, individuals more (vs. less) religious were more effective in using cognitive reappraisal in the laboratory. We discuss how these findings inform our understanding of the psychology of religion and of emotion regulation.

156,Intergroup conflict self-perpetuates via meaning: Exposure to intergroup conflict increases meaning and fuels a desire for further conflict,"We investigated whether violent conflict provides individuals with a sense of meaning that they are hesitant to let go of, thus contributing to the perpetuation of intergroup conflict. Across a wide variety of contexts, we found that making intergroup conflict salient increased the meaning people found in conflict and, in turn, increased support for conflict-perpetuating beliefs, ideologies, policies, and behaviors. These effects were detected among participants exposed to reminders of intergroup conflict (the American Revolutionary War and the U.S.-led campaign against {ISIS}; Studies 1A and 1B), participants living through actual intergroup conflict (the 2014 Israel–Gaza war; Study 2), and participants who perceived actual intergroup conflicts to be larger versus smaller in scope (the November 2015 Paris attacks; Studies 3 and 4). We also found that directly manipulating the perceived meaning in conflict (in the context of the 2014 {NYC} 'hatchet attack'; Study 5) led to greater perceived meaning in life in general and thereby greater support for conflict escalation. Together, these findings suggest that intergroup conflict can serve as a source of meaning that people are motivated to hold on to. We discuss our findings in the context of the meaning making and threat compensation literatures, and consider their implications for perspectives on conflict escalation and resolution.

157,American individualism rises and falls with the economy: Cross-temporal evidence that individualism declines when the economy falters,"Past work has shown that economic growth often engenders greater individualism. Yet much of this work charts changes in wealth and individualism over long periods of time, making it unclear whether rising individualism is primarily driven by wealth or by the social and generational changes that often accompany large-scale economic transformations. This article explores whether individualism is sensitive to more transient macroeconomic fluctuations, even in the absence of transformative social changes or generational turnover. Six studies found that individualism swelled during prosperous times and fell during recessionary times. In good economic times, Americans were more likely to give newborns uncommon names (Study 1), champion autonomy in children (Study 2), aspire to look different from others (Study 3), and favor music with self-focused language (Study 4). Conversely, when the economy was floundering, Americans were more likely to socialize children to attend to the needs of others (Study 2) and favor music with other-oriented language (Study 4). Subsequent studies found that recessions engendered uncertainty (Study 5) which in turn tempered individualism and fostered interdependence (Study 6).

158,The effects of {COVID}-19 and collective identity trauma (intersectional discrimination) on social status and well-being,"To understand how the {COVID}-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting minorities’ victims of discrimination, we examined its impact as traumatic stress, coupled with intersected discriminations, on socioeconomic status and well-being. We used previously collected data from 1,374 participants from seven Arab countries. The data included measures of {COVID}-19 traumatic stress, collective identity trauma (intersected discrimination), socioeconomic status, well-being, existential status and death anxieties, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and general anxiety. We analyzed the data using path analysis and multigroup invariance. Results indicated that {COVID}-19 traumatic stress coupled with collective identity traumas (intersected discrimination) increased existential status and death anxieties and contributed significantly to lower social status and reduced well-being, and increased posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. The conclusion is that {COVID}-19 creates a vicious cycle, with disparities/inequalities increasing infection and death from {COVID}-19, and {COVID}-19 increasing disparities/inequalities further. We found that these relationships’ path model is strictly invariant across gender and strongly invariant across the country groups tested. We discussed the conceptual, clinical, and social justice implications and limitations of the study.

Participants’ levels of {MHBs} were positively associated with their support for war and aggressive security policies (Studies 1 and 2), as well as beliefs in pure evil and perceptions of the world as a competitive jungle (Study 2), and they were negatively associated with their support for peacemaking (Study 2) even after controlling for participants’ levels of social desirability, conservatism, and trait aggression (Study 1); sex (Studies 1 and 2); and beliefs in pure evil and pure good (Study 2).

160,Reminders of a stigmatized status might help smokers quit,"As members of a devalued group, it is not surprising that smokers experience stigmatization and discrimination. But it is not clear whether smokers react to these experiences by moving toward or away from their group membership and identity as smokers. Guided by the identity threat model of stigma (Major \& O’Brien, 2005), we examined the process of stigmatization and its emotional, cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral consequences. We experimentally examined how reading a stigmatizing newspaper article or a control article (Experiment 1) and recalling one’s experience with smoking discrimination or a control prompt (Experiment 2) affected smokers’ responses. We also examined the role of cultural contexts (United States vs. Denmark; only in Experiment 1) and smoking identity. In Experiment 1, we used a community sample of smokers from the United States (N = 111) and Denmark (N = 111). We found that reading the stigmatizing article (compared with the control) caused more rejection sensitivity (U.S. participants only) and more intentions to quit smoking (both U.S. and Danish participants) for smokers low in smoking identity. In Experiment 2, we used an online sample of 194 U.S. smokers and found that recalling instances of mistreatment made smokers more stressed, rejection sensitive, and interested in smoking cessation when smokers appraised the stigma cue as threatening. Thus, we generally found that identity threat moved smokers toward leaving their stigmatized group (e.g., quitting smoking) rather than away from it. Our studies highlight the importance of understanding the psychological process by which smokers distance themselves from their spoiled identity.

161,The dramaturgical perspective in relation to self and culture,"Social scientists have studied human behavior from the dramaturgical perspective ({DP}), through which society is viewed as an elaborate play or game in which individuals enact different roles. The {DP} is more than a theoretical construct; members of individualist, secular societies occasionally adopt the {DP} with relation to their own lives. The current research examined the consequences of adopting the {DP} for evaluations of the self and conceptions of reality at large. Study 1 examined the attitudinal correlates of {DP} endorsement to test our claim that the {DP} is situated in an ideological context of individualism and secular modernism. Supporting our claim that the {DP} invalidates external information about the self’s value, in Studies 2A and 2B individuals endorsed the {DP} to a greater extent after a self-esteem threat, and Studies 2C and 3 showed that exposure to the {DP} (but not a direct system threat) buffered self-esteem threats. Examining moderators of the {DP}’s influence on self-esteem, Study 4 showed that taking the {DP} with regard to the ultimate value (vs. concrete experience) of a social role decreased self-esteem and investment in that role. Studies 5A and 5B examined the {DP}’s consequences for perceived moral objectivism. Adopting the {DP} decreased moral objectivism and moralization of various behaviors but not when the intrinsic self was dispositionally or situationally salient. The latter finding suggests that although contemporary individuals can and occasionally do adopt a reflective stance toward their place within social reality, they nevertheless continue to believe in a true, core self that transcends that precarious drama.

162,The psychology of right-wing terrorism: A text-based personality analysis,"Objectives: Despite its growing importance, few quantitative studies on right-wing terrorism exist. This study develops and tests the implications of a novel theory of right-wing terrorism. It hypothesizes that the right-wing terrorist personality is uniquely characterized by vengefulness and a perception that the world is fundamentally chaotic. Method: Using recently developed approaches in computational personality assessment, a large corpus of texts—by right-wing terrorists (N = 12), Islamist terrorists (N = 12), and controls (N = 9,660)—is analyzed to test whether those written by right-wing terrorists are associated with the proposed personality features. Results: Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results show that there is a statistically significant relationship between preoccupation with revenge and chaos and right-wing terrorism. Further analysis reveals that the proposed personality features assist in accurately classifying texts written by right-wing terrorists. Conclusion: Results reveal that right-wing terrorists have unique personality features that differ from the general population and other terrorists. Future research is needed to typologize different forms of terrorism based on their personality profiles. Additionally, the method here is shown useful for screening large quantities of text for potential extremists.

163,Quid pro quo: The effect of individuals' exchange orientation on prosocial behavior and the moderating role of mortality salience,"Individuals high in exchange orientation expect immediate and comparable rewards in order to establish exchange equality after they have provided rewards for others. Therefore, such individuals should be less likely than individuals low in exchange orientation to behave prosocially because doing such usually leads to exchange inequality (i.e., postponement of reciprocal expectations). However, research on terror management theory has indicated that an adherence to prosocial norms increases after mortality salience, especially in situations where those norms are prescribed and cognitively focused. Based on this, we predicted and found evidence that when participants who were high (vs. low) in exchange orientation were directly asked in a face-to-face interaction to donate their participation payment to a charity, they were less likely to donate unless they had first been reminded of their own death.

165,The processes underlying the quality of contact with the primary out-group and in-group importance on support for the Syrian resettlement in a post-accord context,"The current sociopolitical climate of Northern Ireland presents an intriguing setting to examine how, following a 30-year period of sectarian violence, individuals in a society of protracted intergroup conflict respond to other victimized groups. Syrian refugees were identified as the novel out-group due to the 2,000 Syrians refugees to be resettled in Northern Ireland through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme. This article was interested in understanding if the perceptions one has about the primary out-group in Northern Ireland, generalize to a novel out-group entering the setting. It was hypothesized that higher quality of contact with the primary out-group would be positively related to support for Syrian resettlement in Northern Ireland, whereas high in-group importance would be negatively related to this outcome. Moreover, the authors wanted to identify potential mechanisms through which the predictor variables influenced support for the Syrian resettlement. Participants (N = 378; M = 27.40, {SD} = 11.31 years; 70\% female; 58\% Catholic, 42\% Protestant) were recruited from community groups, local businesses, and universities. The results of the chain mediation models indicated the quality of contact with the primary out-group and in-group importance were related (positively and negatively, respectively) with support for the Syrian resettlement via perspective taking and intergroup attitudes. These findings highlight that interventions to improve intergroup attitudes may facilitate support prior to and during resettlement.

166,"Cultural norm fulfillment, interpersonal belonging, or getting ahead? A large-scale cross-cultural test of three perspectives on the function of self-esteem","What is the function of self-esteem? We classified relevant theoretical work into 3 perspectives. The cultural norm-fulfillment perspective regards self-esteem a result of adherence to cultural norms. The interpersonal-belonging perspective regards self-esteem as a sociometer of interpersonal belonging. The getting-ahead perspective regards self-esteem as a sociometer of getting ahead in the social world, while regarding low anxiety/neuroticism as a sociometer of getting along with others. The 3 perspectives make contrasting predictions on the relation between the Big Five personality traits and self-esteem across cultures. We tested these predictions in a self-report study (2,718,838 participants from 106 countries) and an informant-report study (837,655 informants from 64 countries). We obtained some evidence for cultural norm fulfillment, but the effect size was small. Hence, this perspective does not satisfactorily account for self-esteem’s function. We found a strong relation between Extraversion and higher self-esteem, but no such relation between Agreeableness and self-esteem. These 2 traits are pillars of interpersonal belonging. Hence, the results do not fit the interpersonal-belonging perspective either. However, the results closely fit the getting-ahead perspective. The relation between Extraversion and higher self-esteem is consistent with this perspective, because Extraversion is the Big Five driver for getting ahead in the social world. The relation between Agreeableness and lower neuroticism is also consistent with this perspective, because Agreeableness is the Big Five driver for getting along with others.

It is important to examine the psychological processes that link boredom and impulsiveness to understand this relationship. We propose that heightened impulsiveness in response to boredom partly stems from people’s attempts to deal with meaninglessness when bored. In Studies 1–2, we found that perceived meaninglessness, characteristic of boredom, mediated the relationship between boredom and impulsiveness. In Study 3, we additionally hypothesized that self-awareness serves as a catalyst of boredom-induced impulsiveness by highlighting meaninglessness. Accordingly, Study 3 showed that manipulated boredom promoted impulsiveness through meaninglessness, particularly at greater levels of self-awareness. These studies support our hypothesis that impulsiveness is a response to boredom and the meaninglessness that boredom signals.

169,Making the {CASE} for shadow creativity,"In this article we focus on systematically overlooked forms of creative expression and propose the {CASE} model to account for them and the reasons why they often go unrecognized. This model points us to four main reasons why creative outcomes can easily remain in the shadows or go unrecognized even if they demonstrate novelty and usefulness to different degrees. These are: lack of capital (C); lack of awareness of being creative or doing creative work (A); lack of spark or of having the original creative idea (S); and lack of exceptionality or the property of visibly standing out from other productions (E). Each one of these is discussed and exemplified given that lacking one or more of the above dimensions significantly decreases the chances of the contributions being considered creative, or even potentially creative, by the outside world or even the creator. We conclude with some reflections on why appreciating shadow creativities can foster personal development as well as increase social justice for the benefit of all.

170,A theoretical and empirical review of the death-thought accessibility concept in terror management research,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) highlights the motivational impact of thoughts of death in various aspects of everyday life. Since its inception in 1986, research on {TMT} has undergone a slight but significant shift from an almost exclusive focus on the manipulation of thoughts of death to a marked increase in studies that measure the accessibility of death-related cognition. Indeed, the number of death-thought accessibility ({DTA}) studies in the published literature has grown substantially in recent years. In light of this increasing reliance on the {DTA} concept, the present article is meant to provide a comprehensive theoretical and empirical review of the literature employing this concept. After discussing the roots of {DTA}, the authors outline the theoretical refinements to {TMT} that have accompanied significant research findings associated with the {DTA} concept. Four distinct categories (mortality salience, death association, anxiety-buffer threat, and dispositional) are derived to organize the reviewed {DTA} studies, and the theoretical implications of each category are discussed. Finally, a number of lingering empirical and theoretical issues in the {DTA} literature are discussed with the aim of stimulating and focusing future research on {DTA} specifically and {TMT} in general.

Analyzing a stratified sample of Philippine respondents, we investigate how anger and fear interact with memberships in low- and high-power classed and regional groups in predicting support for populist President Rodrigo Duterte and various policies of his regime. Lower levels of regional and classed power intensified the association between emotions and populist support. Power-laden complications were also detected on the policy level.

172,Different physiological reactions when observing lies versus truths: Initial evidence and an intervention to enhance accuracy,"Humans consistently face the challenge of discerning liars from truth-tellers. Hundreds of studies in which observers judge the veracity of laboratory-created lies and truths suggest that this is a difficult task; in this context, lie-detection accuracy is notoriously poor. Challenging these findings and traditional methodologies in lie-detection research, we draw upon the somatic marker hypothesis and research on interoception to find that: (a) people experience physiological reactions indicating increased sympathetic arousal while observing real, high-stakes lies (vs. truths), and (b) attending to these physiological reactions may improve lie-detection accuracy. Consistent with the tipping point framework, participants demonstrated more physiological arousal and vasoconstriction while observing real crime liars versus truth-tellers, but not mock crime liars versus truth-tellers (Experiment 1; N = 48). Experiment 2 replicated this effect in a larger sample of participants (N = 169). Experiment 3 generalized this effect to a novel set of stimuli; participants demonstrated more physiological arousal to game show contestants who lied (vs. told the truth) about their intention to cooperate in a high-stakes economic game (N = 71). In an intervention study (Experiment 4; N = 428), participants were trained to attend to their physiological signals; lie-detection accuracy increased relative to a control condition. Experiment 5 (N = 354) replicated this effect, and the addition of a bogus training condition suggested that increased accuracy was not simply attributable to self-focused attention. Findings highlight the limitations of relying on laboratory-created lies to study human lie-detection and suggest that observers have automatic, physiological reactions to being deceived.

173,Is dissonance reduction a special case of fluid compensation? Evidence that dissonant cognitions cause compensatory affirmation and abstraction,"Cognitive dissonance theory shares much in common with other perspectives that address anomalies, uncertainty, and general expectancy violations. This has led some theorists to argue that these theories represent overlapping psychological processes. If responding to dissonance and uncertainty occurs through a common psychological process, one should expect that the behavioral outcomes of feeling uncertain would also apply to feelings of dissonance, and vice versa. One specific prediction from the meaning maintenance model would be that cognitive dissonance, like other expectancy violations, should lead to the affirmation of unrelated beliefs, or the abstraction of unrelated schemas when the dissonant event cannot be easily accommodated. This article presents 4 studies (N = 1124) demonstrating that the classic induced-compliance dissonance paradigm can lead not only to a change of attitudes (dissonance reduction), but also to (a) an increased reported belief in God (Study 2), (b) a desire to punish norm-violators (Study 1 and 3), (c) a motivation to detect patterns amid noise (Study 3), and (d) polarizing support of public policies among those already biased toward a particular side (Study 4). These results are congruent with theories that propose content-general fluid compensation following the experience of anomaly, a finding not predicted by dissonance theory. The results suggest that dissonance reduction behaviors may share psychological processes described by other theories addressing violations of expectations.

174,The effect of visualizing healthy eaters and mortality reminders on nutritious grocery purchases: An integrative terror management and prototype willingness analysis,"Objective: To use insights from an integration of the terror management health model and the prototype willingness model to inform and improve nutrition-related behavior using an ecologically valid outcome. Method: Prior to shopping, grocery shoppers were exposed to a reminder of mortality (or pain) and then visualized a healthy (vs. neutral) prototype. Receipts were collected postshopping and food items purchased were coded using a nutrition database. Results: Compared with those in the control conditions, participants who received the mortality reminder and who were led to visualize a healthy eater prototype purchased more nutritious foods. Conclusion: The integration of the terror management health model and the prototype willingness model has the potential for both basic and applied advances and offers a generative ground for future research.

175,Mortality salience and the spreading activation of worldview-relevant constructs: Exploring the cognitive architecture of terror management,"Seven experiments assessed the hypothesis derived from terror management theory that reminding people of their mortality would increase accessibility of constructs central to their worldview. Experiment 1 found that mortality primes, relative to control primes, increased accessibility of nationalistic constructs for men but not for women. Experiment 2 replicated this finding and also found that mortality salience increased romantic accessibility for women but not for men. Four subsequent experiments supported the role of unconscious death-related ideation in producing these effects. A final experiment demonstrated that situational primes can increase the accessibility of nationalistic constructs for women after mortality salience. The roles of situational cues and individual differences in the effects of exposure to death-related stimuli on worldview-relevant construct accessibility are discussed.

176,Conceptual priming and context reinstatement: A test of direct and indirect interview techniques,"Recent findings suggest that priming may be useful for facilitating disclosure in investigative interviews; however, the effects of priming on behavioral outcomes have been mixed. The current studies attempted to replicate the increase in information disclosure when the concept of 'openness' is primed. We assessed the separate and combined influence of context reinstatement instructions and activation of the concept of openness (via lexical primes in Experiment 1, via contextual and embodiment primes in Experiment 2) on information disclosure. In doing so, we introduced a novel paradigm to investigate factors contributing to the elicitation of sensitive personal information that participants provided in written (Experiment 1) or verbal (Experiment 2) form. Participants (Experiment 1: N = 173; Experiment 2: N = 194) completed a checklist of illegal behaviors and misdeeds, then engaged in an unrelated task that was used to administer the priming manipulation (either the concept of 'open' or 'closed,' or a neutral prime). Participants then described a life event related to the most serious illegal behavior to which they had admitted, following either a direct request for information or a context reinstatement instruction. Across both experiments, context reinstatement led to robust increases in information disclosure. Although we failed to replicate prior effects of priming on disclosure, our observed effect sizes fell within the confidence intervals of previous studies. A meta-analytic assessment of priming across the two studies suggested a small but significant increase in information elicitation, suggesting that investigators are best served using evidence-based interviewing tactics during investigative interviews.

177,Managing others like you were managed: How prevention focus motivates copying interpersonal norms,"In 5 studies, we investigated the relation between regulatory focus and the tendency to copy a role model's managing behavior after one experiences this behavior as its recipient and later takes on the same managing role. Because enacting role-related behaviors fulfills interpersonal norms that fit prevention concerns, we predicted a stronger tendency to copy among individuals with a stronger prevention focus on duties and obligations ('oughts') but not among those with a stronger promotion focus on aspirations and advancements (ideals). We also predicted that individuals with a stronger prevention focus would tend to copy a managing behavior regardless of their earlier hedonic experience with this behavior as its recipient. These predictions were first supported in 2 experimental studies, where a stronger prevention focus was measured as a chronic disposition (Study 1) and experimentally induced as a temporary state (Study 2). Further, we tested the mechanism underlying the relation between stronger prevention and stronger copying and found that concerns about the normativeness, but not the effectiveness, of a managing behavior motivated copying for individuals with a strong prevention focus (Studies 3 and 4). We generalized these experimental results to the field by surveying a sample of superior-subordinate dyads in real world organizations (Study 5). Across all studies, we found that individuals with a stronger prevention focus tend to copy more a role model's managing behavior—independent of their hedonic satisfaction with the behavior as its recipient and their perception of its effectiveness.

178,The impact of organizational performance on the emergence of Asian American leaders,"Despite remarkably high levels of education and income, Asian Americans remain underrepresented at the top of the organizational hierarchy. Existing work suggests that a mismatch between the prototypical characteristics of business leaders (e.g., dominance) and stereotypes associated with Asian Americans (e.g., submissiveness) lowers the likelihood that Asian Americans will emerge as leaders. We predict that this reluctance to appoint Asian Americans will be attenuated when organizations experience performance decline because decision makers believe Asian Americans are inclined to sacrifice their self-interest to improve the welfare of others. We found support for these predictions using a multimethod approach. In an archival study of 4,951 {CEOs} across five decades, we find that Asian Americans were appointed almost two-and-a-half times more often during decline than nondecline (Study 1). Then, in three studies, we show that this pattern occurs because evaluators (a) prefer self-sacrificing leaders more when organizations are experiencing decline than success (Study 2); (b) expect Asian Americans leaders to behave in self-sacrificing ways in general (Study 3); and, consequently, (c) perceive that Asian Americans are better equipped to be leaders during decline than success (Study 4). We consider these findings in tandem with a set of exploratory analyses. This includes our finding that organizations experience decline only 12\% of the time, suggesting that evaluators deem Asian Americans to be suitable leaders in circumstances that occur infrequently and are short-lived.

179,When private reporting is more positive than public reporting: Pluralistic ignorance towards atheists,"Across three studies, we assessed the impact of perceived social norms on attitudes and positive behavioral intentions towards atheists and religious believers. Reported attitudes, reported acceptability of expressing positive and negative attitudes, and reported positive behavioral intentions disproportionately favored religious believers over atheists. However, participants reported a higher likelihood of engaging in positive behaviors towards atheists when the threat of public scrutiny was limited, indicating that the social norm in the {US} may be suppressing privately held, positive behavioral intentions that would otherwise support atheists, creating a state of pluralistic ignorance. Individuals also reported having more positive attitudes and a higher level of positive behavioral intentions towards religious believers relative to others. Finally, estimates of the prevalence of religious believers in the population also tied directly to one’s perception of the acceptability of expressing positive and negative attitudes towards these groups.

180,"Trio of terror (pregnancy, menstruation, and breastfeeding): An existential function of literal self-objectification among women","Research and theorizing suggest that objectification entails perceiving a person not as a human being but, quite literally, as an object. However, the motive to regard the self as an object is not well understood. The current research tested the hypothesis that literal self-objectification can serve a terror management function. From this perspective, the female body poses a unique existential threat on account of its role in reproduction, and regarding the self as an object is posited to shield women from this threat because objects, in contrast to humans, are not mortal. Across 5 studies, 3 operationalizations of literal self-objectification were employed (a denial of essentially human traits to the self, overlap in the explicit assignment of traits to the self and objects, and implicit associations between self and objects using an implicit association test) in response to 3 aspects of women’s bodies involved in reproduction (pregnancy, menstruation, and breastfeeding). In each study, priming mortality led women (but not men, included in Studies 1, 3, 4, and 5) to literally self-objectify in conditions where women’s reproductive features were salient. In addition, literal self-objectification was found to mediate subsequent responsiveness to death-related stimuli (Study 4). Together, these findings are the first to demonstrate a direct link between mortality salience, women’s role in reproduction, and their self-objectification, supporting an existential function of self-objectification in women.

Two large-scale experiments (Ns = 248 and 1,115) investigated how American adults interpret reports of crimes committed by either a Christian or Muslim, and how these interpretations depend on political ideology. Results show liberals attributing crimes more to religion for Christian rather than Muslim offenders, with the opposite effect for conservatives. Importantly, these biases also influenced how people communicated the news report to others. Additionally, evidence suggests that attitudes toward Islam and not toward Muslims may explain these effects. Implications for how political ideology affects interpretation and communication of media portrayals of Muslims are discussed.

182,"Fake news, fast and slow: Deliberation reduces belief in false (but not true) news headlines","What role does deliberation play in susceptibility to political misinformation and 'fake news'? The Motivated System 2 Reasoning ({MS}2R) account posits that deliberation causes people to fall for fake news, because reasoning facilitates identity-protective cognition and is therefore used to rationalize content that is consistent with one’s political ideology. The classical account of reasoning instead posits that people ineffectively discern between true and false news headlines when they fail to deliberate (and instead rely on intuition). To distinguish between these competing accounts, we investigated the causal effect of reasoning on media truth discernment using a 2-response paradigm. Participants (N = 1,635 Mechanical Turkers) were presented with a series of headlines. For each, they were first asked to give an initial, intuitive response under time pressure and concurrent working memory load. They were then given an opportunity to rethink their response with no constraints, thereby permitting more deliberation. We also compared these responses to a (deliberative) 1-response baseline condition where participants made a single choice with no constraints. Consistent with the classical account, we found that deliberation corrected intuitive mistakes: Participants believed false headlines (but not true headlines) more in initial responses than in either final responses or the unconstrained 1-response baseline. In contrast—and inconsistent with the Motivated System 2 Reasoning account—we found that political polarization was equivalent across responses. Our data suggest that, in the context of fake news, deliberation facilitates accurate belief formation and not partisan bias.

Results: Men reacted to death primes by emotionally withdrawing from a {PWD} and reporting less compassion, whereas women exhibited more compassionate responses. These differences in compassion were reflected in the death-related cognitions and fears sparked by physical disability.

184,A meta-analytic investigation of the relation between interpersonal attraction and enacted behavior,"We present a meta-analysis that investigated the relation between self-reported interpersonal attraction and enacted behavior. Our synthesis focused on (a) identifying the behaviors related to attraction; (b) evaluating the efficacy of models of the relation between attraction and behavior; (c) testing the impact of several moderators, including evaluative threat salience, cognitive appraisal salience, and the sex composition of the social interaction; and (d) investigating the degree of agreement between the meta-analytic findings and an ethnographic analysis. Using a multilevel modeling approach, an analysis of 309 effect sizes (N = 5,422) revealed a significant association (z = .20) between self-reported attraction and enacted behavior. Key findings include: (a) that the specific behaviors associated with attraction (e.g., eye contact, smiling, laughter, mimicry) are those behaviors research has linked to the development of trust/rapport; (b) direct behaviors (e.g., physical proximity, talking to), compared with indirect behaviors (e.g., eye contact, smiling, mimicry), were more strongly related to self-reported attraction; and (c) evaluative threat salience (e.g., fear of rejection) reduced the magnitude of the relation between direct behavior and affective attraction. Moreover, an ethnographic analysis revealed consistency between the behaviors identified by the meta-analysis and those behaviors identified by ethnographers as predictive of attraction. We discuss the implications of our findings for models of the relation between attraction and behavior, for the behavioral expressions of emotions, and for how attraction is measured and conceptualized.

We used a combined five data sets that included participants from Egypt, Turkey, Kuwait, Syria, and the United Kingdom (N = 1,566). We used measures of {WTELS}, resilience, emotion regulation, identity salience, {PTG}, interfaith spirituality, {PTSD}, and poor health. We used path analysis to test a model of the effects of {WTELS} and {CST} on {PTG} and {PTSD} as mediated by resilience, interfaith spirituality, emotion regulation (reappraisal), and identity salience. Further, we used {PROCESS} macro to test the direct and indirect effects of {WTELS} through the mediators. Additionally, we used curve estimation regression to explore the linear and nonlinear relationships among the predictor variables: {WTELS}, {CST}, and the outcome variables of {PTG} and {PTSD}. {WTELS} was found to have moderate direct positive effects on {PTG}, reappraisal, and resilience. It had strong direct and significant indirect negative effects on {PTSD}. The direct effects of {WTELS} on {PTG} were more than twice its indirect effects. Emotion regulation (reappraisal) had the highest effect size as a mediator responsible for its indirect effects on {PTG}, followed by the resilience and interfaith spirituality. Although {WTELS} was associated with {PTG} more linearly, {CST} and {PTG}, {CST} and {PTSD}, and {PTSD} and {PTG} were associated more nonlinearly.

186,Systematic review of mental health symptoms in firefighters exposed to routine duty-related critical incidents,"Due to high rates of potentially traumatic exposure ({PTE}) within the firefighting profession, a large body of literature concerning firefighters’ mental health has developed over recent decades. However, given variable prevalence outcomes and the largely descriptive nature of most studies, it is unclear whether the prevalence of trauma-related mental disorders in firefighters is elevated in comparison with the general population. The present systematic review examined literature on prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety in firefighters exposed to routine, duty-related {PTEs} to synthesize prevalence outcomes across the literature. Systematic search of 6 databases was conducted to review eligible articles published between 1980 and 2017 in any language. In all, 40 articles concerned firefighters exposed to routine work-related {PTE}. We report that strong evidence exists to suggest that the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression is elevated in firefighters compared with the general population of Canada, whereas moderate evidence exists for the elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders. However, measurement tool is a substantial source of variability in prevalence estimates across the literature, and few predictive factors bear consistent relationships to posttraumatic stress disorder across samples. Future work should focus on measurement variance and examine possible interactions between commonly assessed predictive factors for disorder risk in firefighters.

In the Terman sample (Study 1), Protestant men and women who had sexual problems related to anxieties about taboos and depravity had greater creative accomplishments, as compared to those with sexual problems unrelated to such concerns and to those reporting no sexual problems. Two laboratory experiments (Studies 2 and 3) found that Protestants produced more creative artwork (sculptures, poems, collages, cartoon captions) when they were (a) primed with damnation-related words, (b) induced to feel unacceptable sexual desires, or (c) forced to suppress their anger. Activating anger or sexual attraction was not enough; it was the forbidden or suppressed nature of the emotion that gave the emotion its creative power. The studies provide possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and suggest a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms.

Terror Management Theory seeks to explain how reminders of death lead individuals to react violently, harshly, and defensively to threats against their worldviews. Perspective taking is an interpersonal skill which involves an individual empathically viewing a situation from the perspective of another person (Ozer \& Benet-Martinez, 2006). Individuals with disabilities are discriminated against and blamed for their disabilities, even when their disabilities are purely due to circumstance. The present study aimed to examine the effects of mortality salience on individuals' victim blaming tendencies (independent variable 1) and whether or not perspective taking reduces such an effect(independent variable 2).

192,Toward a greater understanding of the emotional dynamics of the mortality salience manipulation: Revisiting the 'affect-free' claim of terror management research,"The experimental manipulation of mortality salience ({MS}) represents one of the most widely used methodological procedures in social psychology, having been employed by terror management researchers in hundreds of studies over the last 20 years. One of the more provocative conclusions regarding this task is that it does not produce any reliable changes in self-reported affect, a view that we refer to as the affect-free claim. After reviewing 336 published studies that used the standard version of the {MS} task, we suggest that the evidence on which this claim is based may be less definitive than is commonly supposed. Moreover, we propose that the {MS} manipulation can, in fact, produce significant and meaningful changes in affect once one employs the appropriate measures and experimental design. In support of this position, we report 4 experiments, each of which demonstrates reliable activation of negative affect, especially with respect to fear-/terror-related sentiments.

Five studies examined the relation between threats of violence and agreeableness at the level of nations, individuals, and situations. People living in countries with higher military spending (Study 1) and those who chronically perceive threats from others (Study 2) were more agreeable. However, this threat-linked agreeableness was selective (Studies 3–5). Participants primed with threat were more agreeable and willing to help familiar others but were less agreeable and willing to help unfamiliar others. Additionally, people from large families, for whom affiliation may be a salient response to threat, were more likely than people from small families to shift in agreeableness. Returning to the national level, military spending was associated with increased trust in ingroup members but decreased trust in outgroups. Together, these findings demonstrate that agreeableness is selectively modulated by threats of violence.

195,Shared reality makes life meaningful: Are we really going in the right direction?,"We propose that evaluating a life as meaningful or significant is the outgrowth of a critical human motivation—the motivation to have others verify that what is going on in one’s life, others’ lives, and the world really matters and makes sense. A meaningful life is one that is judged to be 'going in the right direction,' with a current life trajectory that is moving toward worthwhile goals—a trajectory that reveals the underlying truth of that life. For these ends to be experienced as ends that really matter, they need to be verified by others as being the right ends, thereby making them objectively worthwhile. Thus, shared reality, which transforms the subjective to objective through fundamental epistemic and social motives (Hardin \& Higgins, 1996), is essential for a meaningful life and a meaningful world. Importantly, our use of shared reality in meaning-making has both costs and benefits, including ideological conflicts on the one hand and moral altruism on the other. Nonetheless, it is an essential part of human psychology. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Cornwell, James F. M. and Franks, Becca and Higgins, E. Tory",0,,195
196,A justification-suppression model of the expression and experience of prejudice,"The authors propose a justification-suppression model ({JSM}), which characterizes the processes that lead to prejudice expression and the experience of one's own prejudice. They suggest that 'genuine' prejudices are not directly expressed but are restrained by beliefs, values, and norms that suppress them. Prejudices are expressed when justifications (e.g., attributions, ideologies, stereotypes) release suppressed prejudices. The same process accounts for which prejudices are accepted into the self-concept. The {JSM} is used to organize the prejudice literature, and many empirical findings are recharacterized as factors affecting suppression or justification, rather than directly affecting genuine prejudice. The authors discuss the implications of the {JSM} for several topics, including prejudice measurement, ambivalence, and the distinction between prejudice and its expression.

197,Need depriving effects of financial insecurity: Implications for well-being and financial behaviors,"Evidence suggests that experiencing financial insecurity lowers well-being and increases problematic financial behaviors. The present article employs a self-determination theory ({SDT}; R. M. Ryan \& Deci, 2000a) perspective to understand the mechanisms by which experiencing financial insecurity contributes to these detrimental outcomes. Informed by {SDT}, we expected that the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness would drive these effects. Studies were concerned with individuals’ general experiences of financial insecurity (using community samples; Studies 1 and 2), and employed manipulations involving self-reflection (Study 3) and hypothetical scenarios (Study 4). Findings demonstrated that financially insecure conditions undermined basic psychological needs and lowered well-being (measured in terms of self-esteem, depression, and anxiety). In addition, lower satisfaction of basic psychological needs linked financial insecurity to a greater likelihood of engaging in financial cheating (Studies 2 and 3) and risky financial decisions (Study 4). Importantly, this pattern of effects remained in evidence across socioeconomically diverse samples and income levels. We discuss implications for future interventions to improve the wellness of individuals in financially insecure circumstances.

198,To be or not to be tolerant? A terror management perspective exploring the ideological dilemma of tolerance and prejudice,"Tolerance has been identified as a way to reduce prejudice. However, tolerance has also been posited as an ideological dilemma and may have its limits. The present research explores this idea, utilizing insights from Terror Management Theory. Three studies were conducted using online samples. Study 1 found that a tolerance prime led to less discrimination towards Muslims after being reminded of death, but increased discrimination when reminded of terrorism. Additionally, tolerance did not affect levels of affective prejudice. Study 2 found that reading an essay that threatened the norm of tolerance led to increased levels of death‐thought accessibility and worldview defence, particularly amongst liberal participants. Study 3 found that a tolerance prime attenuated mortality salience decreasing support for author rights, but not if the worldview critic was intolerant. Taken together, the present findings suggest that using tolerance to reduce prejudice and foster more positive intergroup relations has its boundaries. If others are perceived to not be tolerant themselves, then people may be more motivated to defend, rather than uphold the norm of tolerance.

199,Remembering the real me: Nostalgia offers a window to the intrinsic self,"Seven studies reveal that nostalgia, a sentimental affection for the past, offers a window to the intrinsic self-concept—who people think they truly are. In Study 1, state nostalgia was associated with higher authenticity and lower extrinsic self-focus (concern with meeting extrinsic value standards). In Study 2, experimentally primed nostalgia increased perceived authenticity of the past self, which in turn predicted reduced current extrinsic self-focus. Study 3 showed that nostalgia increased the accessibility of the intrinsic self-concept but not the everyday self-concept. Study 4 provided evidence for a moderator suggested by our theoretical analysis: Recalling a nostalgic event increased felt nostalgia and positive affect, but this effect was attenuated if participants were prompted to recognize external factors controlling their behavior during that event. Next we treated nostalgia as an outcome variable and a moderator to test whether nostalgia is triggered by, and buffers against, threats to the intrinsic self. Using a mediation approach, Study 5 showed that participants primed to feel blocked in intrinsic self-expression responded with increased nostalgia. In Study 6, intrinsic self-threat reduced intrinsic self-expression and subjective well-being for participants who were not given an opportunity to respond with nostalgia but not for participants who were allowed to reflect on a nostalgic memory. In line with the experimental findings, correlational data from Study 7 indicated that dispositional nostalgia positively predicted intrinsic self-expression and well-being. Understanding nostalgia as a window to the intrinsic self points to new directions for research on nostalgia’s antecedents, moderators, and consequences for well-being.

200,The moderating role of executive functioning in older adults' responses to a reminder of mortality,"In previous research, older adults responded to mortality salience ({MS}) with increased tolerance, whereas younger persons responded with increased punitiveness. One possible explanation for this is that many older adults adapt to challenges of later life, such as the prospect of mortality, by becoming more flexible. Recent studies suggest that positively oriented adaptation is more likely for older adults with high levels of executive functioning. Thus, we hypothesized that the better an older adult's executive functioning, the more likely {MS} would result in increased tolerance. Older and younger adults were randomly assigned to {MS} or control conditions, and then evaluated moral transgressors. As in previous research, younger adults were more punitive after reminders of mortality; executive functioning did not affect their responses. Among older adults, high functioning individuals responded to {MS} with increased tolerance rather than intolerance, whereas those low in functioning became more punitive.

201,Self-concept clarity lays the foundation for self-continuity: The restorative function of autobiographical memory,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology on Sep 9 2019 (see record [rid]2019-54516-001[/rid]). In the article, the first phrase of the second sentence of Study 1 should appear as 'This study begins to test H1'. The third sentence of the Participants and design section of Study 5 should read as follows: We excluded seven participants for not completing the study, and 13 for not following instructions (on participant in the autobiographical memory condition wrote: 'Future of the country,' 'Childrens future,' 'Economy,' 'Finances,' 'Finding a job I enjoy,' 'Health,' 'Comfort,' 'I would talk about my travels,' 'My experience with family issues'). In the Manipulation check section of Study 6 and Study 7, participants instead reported lower self-concept clarity. In the third sentence in the second paragraph of the Low self-concept clarity, autobiographical memory, and self-continuity section of Study 6, the first instance of the word participants should be deleted. The third sentence of the Procedure and material section of Study 7 should read as follows: 'in the control condition, they wrote in favor of environmental protection.' Additional corrections are provided in the erratum. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The current research concerns the relations among self-concept clarity, autobiographic memory, and self-continuity. We hypothesized, and tested in 7 studies, that low self-concept clarity would disrupt self-continuity, but resorting to autobiographic memory would counter this disruption, thus restoring self-continuity. In Studies 1 and 2, low or threatened self-concept clarity was associated with decreased, or led to a decrease of, self-continuity. In Study 3, participants low (vs. high) in self-concept clarity manifested a stronger preference for an autobiographical memory task (but not for a control task). In Study 4, a suppressed mediational model of autobiographical memory received empirical backing: Threatened self-concept clarity decreased self-continuity, but also increased the propensity to evoke autobiographical memory, which fostered self-continuity. By manipulating autobiographical memory in different ways, Studies 5 through 7 provided additional direct evidence for the capacity of autobiographical memory to restore self-continuity. Taken together, the results converge in support of the hypothesis.

202,The implications of death for health: A terror management health model for behavioral health promotion,"This article introduces a terror management health model ({TMHM}). The model integrates disparate health and social psychology literatures to elucidate how the conscious and nonconscious awareness of death can influence the motivational orientation that is most operative in the context of health decisions. Three formal propositions are presented. Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities. In the context of each proposition, moderators are proposed, research is reviewed, and implications for health promotion are discussed.

203,"Societal threat, authoritarianism, conservatism, and {US} state death penalty sentencing (1977-2004)","On the basis of K. Stenner's (2005) authoritarian dynamic theory, it was hypothesized that the number of death sentences and executions would be higher in more threatened conservative states than in less threatened conservative states, and would be lower in more threatened liberal states than in less threatened liberal states. Threat was based on state homicide rate, violent crime rate, and non-White percentage of population. Conservatism was based on state voter ideological identification, Democratic and Republican Party elite liberalism-conservatism, policy liberalism-conservatism, religious fundamentalism, degree of economic freedom, and 2004 presidential election results. For 1977-2004, with controls for state population and years with a death penalty provision, the interactive hypothesis received consistent support using the state conservatism composite and voter ideological identification alone. As well, state conservatism was related to death penalties and executions, but state threat was not. The temporal stability of the findings was demonstrated with a split-half internal replication using the periods 1977-1990 and 1991-2004. The interactive hypothesis and the results also are discussed in the context of other threat-authoritarianism theories and terror management theory.

204,The religiosity as social value hypothesis: A multi-method replication and extension across 65 countries and three levels of spatial aggregation,"Are religious people psychologically better or worse adjusted than their nonreligious counterparts? Hundreds of studies have reported a positive relation between religiosity and psychological adjustment. Recently, however, a comparatively small number of cross-cultural studies has questioned this staple of religiosity research. The latter studies find that religious adjustment benefits are restricted to religious cultures. Gebauer, Sedikides, and Neberich (2012) suggested the religiosity as social value hypothesis ({RASV}) as one explanation for those cross-cultural differences. {RASV} states that, in religious cultures, religiosity possesses much social value, and, as such, religious people will feel particularly good about themselves. In secular cultures, however, religiosity possesses limited social value, and, as such, religious people will feel less good about themselves, if at all. Yet, previous evidence has been inconclusive regarding {RASV} and regarding cross-cultural differences in religious adjustment benefits more generally. To clarify matters, we conducted 3 replication studies. We examined the relation between religiosity and self-esteem (the most direct and appropriate adjustment indicator, according to {RASV}) in a self-report study across 65 countries (N = 2,195,301), an informant-report study across 36 countries (N = 560,264), and another self-report study across 1,932 urban areas from 243 federal states in 18 countries (N = 1,188,536). Moreover, we scrutinized our results against 7, previously untested, alternative explanations. Our results fully and firmly replicated and extended prior evidence for cross-cultural differences in religious adjustment benefits. These cross-cultural differences were best explained by {RASV}.

205,{COVID}-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society,"The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., \#{BoomerRemover}) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults’ mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from {COVID}-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

206,Something’s going on here: Psychological predictors of belief in conspiracy theories,"Research on individual-difference factors predicting belief in conspiracy theories has proceeded along several independent lines that converge on a profile of conspiracy believers as individuals who are relatively untrusting, ideologically eccentric, concerned about personal safety, and prone to perceiving agency in actions and profundity in bullshit. The present research represents the first attempt at an integrative approach to testing the independent contributions of these diverse factors to conspiratorial thinking. Two studies (N = 1,253) found that schizotypy, dangerous-world beliefs, and bullshit receptivity independently and additively predict endorsement of generic (i.e., nonpartisan) conspiracy beliefs. Results suggest that 'hyperactive' agency detection and political orientation (and related variables) might also play a role. The studies found no effects of situational threats (mortality salience or a sense of powerlessness) – though it remains to be seen whether real-world instantiations of situational threats might move some people to seek refuge in conspiratorial ideation.

207,The dynamics of death and meaning: The effects of death-relevant cognitions and personal need for structure on perceptions of meaning in life,"Do reminders of mortality increase or decrease perceptions of life’s meaning? The authors propose that death-relevant thought has divergent effects on meaning perceptions depending on individuals’ personal need for structure ({PNS}) or dispositional desire for structured knowledge. In prior research, high-{PNS} individuals primed with mortality-related stimuli were found to employ clearly structured conceptions of reality. Consequently, these individuals were expected to show stable or even bolstered perceptions of meaning when death thought was heightened. Low-{PNS} individuals did not show this tendency and were therefore expected to show decreased meaning under heightened death-thought activation. The results of Studies 1a–1d supported these hypotheses. Studies 2 and 3 sought to identify how low-{PNS} individuals might reaffirm meaning and found that death thought increased their willingness to explore novelty. Studies 4 and 5 directly tested the meaning-conferring function of novelty seeking among low-{PNS} individuals, showing that the consideration of novel interpretations of the world and their experiences affirmed a sense of meaning in life following reminders of death. Discussion focuses on the relationship between meaning and death and the unique ways low-{PNS} individuals respond to mortality concerns.

208,Time capsule: Nostalgia shields psychological wellbeing from limited time horizons,"Nostalgia is a bittersweet—albeit predominantly positive—self-relevant and social emotion that arises from reflecting on fond and meaningful autobiographical memories. Nostalgia might facilitate successful aging by serving as a socioemotional selectivity strategy in the face of limited time horizons. Four studies tested the role of nostalgia in maintaining psychological wellbeing across the adult life span and across differing time perspectives. In Study 1, community adults (N = 443, age 18–91) completed measures of nostalgia proneness and 6 psychological wellbeing dimensions. Age was more positively related to wellbeing for those high than low on nostalgia proneness: High-nostalgic individuals showed a maintenance or increase in psychological wellbeing with age, whereas low-nostalgic individuals did not. In Study 2 (N = 35, age 18–25), experimentally inducing a limited time perspective—a core trigger of socioemotional selectivity—in young adults prompted greater nostalgia. In Study 3 (N = 93, age 18–33) and Study 4 (N = 376, age 18–55), experimentally inducing a limited time perspective reduced some aspects of wellbeing among those who recalled an ordinary (Study 3) or lucky (Study 4) autobiographical memory, but this effect was eliminated among those who recalled a nostalgic memory. Nostalgia buffers perceptions of limited time and facilitates the maintenance of psychological wellbeing across the adult life span.

209,Self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships across time,"Research on the longitudinal association between self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships has led to ambiguous conclusions regarding the temporal order and strength of this relation. Existing studies have examined this association across intervals ranging from days to years, leaving it unclear as to what extent differences in timing may explain differences across studies. In the present study, we used continuous time structural equation models (i.e., {CT}-{SEM}) to examine cross-lagged relations between the constructs, and also distinguished between-person differences from within-person processes (i.e., {RI}-{CT}-{SEM}). We analyzed 10 years of annual data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies of the Social Sciences (N = 14,741). When using {CT}-{SEM}, we found a bidirectional positive relation between self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships, with larger effects over longer intervals. When using {RI}-{CT}-{SEM}, we found the largest effects of self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships across intervals of 1 year, with smaller effect sizes at both shorter and longer intervals. In addition, the effect of fluctuations in people’s satisfaction with social relationships on fluctuations in their self-esteem was greater than the reverse effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering time when examining the relation between self-esteem and interpersonal outcomes and likely psychological constructs in general.

210,Anxiety responses to the unfolding {COVID}-19 crisis: Patterns of change in the experience of prolonged exposure to stressors,"An immense amount of work has investigated how adverse situations affect anxiety using chronic (i.e., average) or episodic conceptualizations. However, less attention has been paid to circumstances that unfold continuously over time, inhibiting theoretical testing and leading to possible erroneous conclusions about how stressors are dynamically appraised across time. Because stressor novelty, predictability, and patterns are central components of appraisal theories, we use the {COVID}-19 crisis as a context to illustrate how variation in the phenomenon’s patterns of change (specifically, total cases [average level] but also the rate of linear [velocity] and nonlinear growth [acceleration] in cases) influence anxiety. We also show the implications of anxiety for next-day functioning at work. These effects are tested in data drawn from a sample of employed adults in a daily diary study conducted in four overlapping waves. The data span the emergence, exponential rise, and initial tapering of the virus in the United States (February 10, 2020 to April 28, 2020). Our results show that although the impact of level of {COVID}-19 cases on anxiety decreases over time, the effect of change in cases (velocity and acceleration) increases over time. Anxiety is then associated with next-day work functioning (engagement, performance, and emotional exhaustion).

In 3 studies, Italian (Studies 1 and 2) and American (Study 3) participants humanized their own group more when their mortality was salient. In Study 3, humanizing the ingroup also functioned to reduce the accessibility of death thoughts.

We reported findings on a newly developed Connection of Soul ({COS}) scale reflecting 3 dominant worldviews conceptualizing a soul’s life after death, involving 2 perspectives of literal immortality and 1 secular perspective. Study 1 supported the scale’s tri-partite structure consisting of secular, God-centered, and cosmic-spiritual dimensions, using factor analysis. Study 2 assessed the scale’s construct validity with measures of death perspectives and religious orientation and tested the differential effects of mortality salience on the {COS} subscales. Study 3 replicated the structure and properties of the {COS} scale and extended previous studies involving measures of personality functioning, everyday life tasks, New Age beliefs, and self-transcendence. The implications of the findings for the conceptualization of beliefs in an afterlife are discussed.

213,Impact of of religiosity and level of acculturation on cultural alignment: An exploration of terror management mechanisms among Muslim American women,"Background: Terror management theory ({TMT}) is based upon the notion that human beings require ongoing psychological protection from the unyielding, existential threat of death. A large body of evidence has shown that human beings manage death-related terror by aligning with and endorsing the dominant views of their cultural worldviews. Notably, as immigrants experience a new culture, worldviews become rearticulated to incorporate elements of host and heritage cultures. However, it is unclear how individuals with prolonged bicultural exposure effectively buffer death-related fears. Few studies in the vast {TMT} literature have been conducted with immigrant populations and the terror management defenses of Muslim American women, in particular, have yet to be investigated. As such, the purpose of this dissertation was to extend {TMT} research by examining the ways in which Muslim American women negotiate diverse aspects of their cultural worldviews to secure terror management benefits.Objectives: The current investigation examined the terror management defenses employed by Muslim American women in the context of elevated death anxiety and tested the potential moderating effects of acculturation and religiosity. In accordance with the mortality salience ({MS}) hypothesis of {TMT}, heightened death awareness was predicted to intensify support of the cultural worldview, such that participants would produce more positive evaluations of a worldview-supporting essay and more negative evaluations of a worldview-threatening essay. The association between increased death salience and worldview defense was also predicted to vary as a function of level of acculturation to U.S. society and religious commitment to Islam.Participants and Methods: The sample included 53 Muslim American female undergraduate students. Following random assignment to the {MS} prime condition or control group, participants read and evaluated two essays that were ostensibly written by Muslim American women in response to an image of a Muslim woman wearing an American flag hijab. The essays were designed to activate either secular or religious defensive responses to messages that challenged American and Islamic values, respectively. Measures of affect, death-thought accessibility, religiosity, acculturation, discrimination-related stress, and collective and personal self-esteem were also included.Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to test the main effect of {MS} and the moderating effects of acculturation and religiosity on worldview defense (i.e., composite essay score). Contrary to expectations, the study's predictor hypotheses were not supported. Heightened death anxiety did not result in the typical increase in worldview defense. Furthermore, the relationship between {MS} and worldview defense was not moderated by acculturation or religiosity.Conclusions: Taken together, the results of the present study did not support our hypotheses. In light of strong empirical support for the effects of heightened death awareness on worldview defense in prior studies, our findings were interpreted with caution. Alternative explanations for our results, limitations of our study design and sample, and avenues for future research with Muslim American women were discussed.

214,Exploring potential prejudice toward older adult mobility device users,"Many older adults require assistive technology to maintain mobility (e.g., canes, walkers, wheelchairs, or scooters), but concerns about experiencing prejudice because of mobility devices can deter use. We explore this potential prejudice in a sample recruited through online crowdsourcing. Overall, prejudice toward older adult mobility device users was not observed. Older adult mobility device users were evaluated more positively than common prejudice target groups. However, heightened prejudice toward older adult mobility device users was observed among those higher in authoritarianism or social dominance orientation. This was explained by perceptions that older adult mobility device users are a greater threat to resources (e.g., health care spending, time, attention) among those higher in these qualities. This pattern was present at all ages assessed but was stronger for those who were younger versus older. Relationships between ideology and heightened threat from older adult mobility device users were not present for those older than 60 years of age. Our results demonstrate that concerns about this prejudice are not completely unwarranted.

215,Influence of mortality salience on effort-related cardiovascular response to an identity-relevant challenge,"Participants were presented a task relevant to their identity after having been exposed to a prime that made mortality more or less salient. For half, difficulty was fixed at a low level; for the rest, difficulty was unfixed. Blending logic from terror management theory ({TMT}) and an analysis concerned with determinants and cardiovascular ({CV}) correlates of effort, we predicted that effort and associated {CV} responses would be (a) greater under high salience conditions when the challenge was unfixed, but (b) low regardless of salience when the challenge was fixed. Findings for systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) confirmed this, with responses for heart rate ({HR}), diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}), and mean arterial pressure ({MAP}) following. Results document uniquely a key {TMT} implication. They also tell us how mortality reminders should affect existential striving and suggest that existential terror should affect {CV} responses indirectly by affecting striving.

216,The namesaking of children as an investment strategy for managing kin relations and bonding fathers to their children,"Namesaking—the naming of a child after a parent or other person, usually a relative—is 1 of the most enduring of human traditions, and its importance is much underestimated in discussions of parenting behaviors. This review and synthesis of namesaking patterns across different times and places makes the argument that the namesaking of a child has long been employed as an adaptive strategy for advertising personal and group identity, for optimally positioning a child within the historical and political framework of the kinship group, and for bonding fathers more strongly to their children. Studies comparing namesaking patterns in adoptive versus nonadoptive families have been especially valuable for our understanding of how namesaking works. Given that most of the research by psychologists on namesaking has been conducted in the United States, there is a clear need for more cross-cultural work on this issue.

217,Art as communication: Fulfilling Gricean communication principles predicts aesthetic liking,"Positive aesthetic experiences plausibly involve viewers’ ability to construct meaning by regarding art as a communicative process. Here we develop and analyze results of a survey extending the Gricean communication framework from language to visual art. Operationalizing the 4 Gricean maxims and an index of intent, we assessed their predictive power for artists’ and nonartists’ aesthetic liking of paintings varying in level of abstraction. Results showed that perceived maxim fulfillment was positively related to increased aesthetic liking and that most maxims maintained consistent predictive power across raters. Comparisons of artists’ and nonartists’ ratings on highly abstract versus representational paintings showed a consistent strong effect for painting type, with representational paintings receiving generally higher ratings on each maxim, intent, and liking by both groups. The Gricean framework is a fruitful means of capturing perceived artistic communication and aesthetic liking, and we discuss ways of developing this model, for instance, in distinguishing maxim fulfillment from understanding nonfulfillment as intentional.

Goldenberg \& J. Arndt, 2008), the authors examined tanning outcomes as a function of priming tanning-relevant standards for attractiveness after reminders of death. Design: Study 1 consisted of 101 female college students recruited from a midwestern university; Study 2 consisted of 53 female participants recruited from a beach in south Florida. In both experiments, participants answered questions about their mortality or a control topic, and were presented with a fashion article that highlighted either the attractiveness of tanned (just in Study 1), pale, or natural-looking skin. Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported suntan intentions (Study 1) and sunscreen intentions (Study 2). Study 2 also assessed participants’ interest in various sun protection products. Results and Conclusions: Study 1 demonstrated that mortality salience led to higher tanning intentions when the association between tanned skin and physical attractiveness was made salient and reduced intentions when the attractiveness of paler skin was highlighted. In Study 2, beachgoers, after reminders of death, reported greater preference for high sun protection sunscreen after reading an article about the attractiveness of paler skin tones. These findings contribute to an emerging understanding of how mortality concerns can influence health-related judgment and behavior.

219,Animalistic dehumanization of older people by younger ones: Variations of humanness perceptions as a function of a target’s age,"The present work investigated associations of older people with humanness. Focusing on complementary approaches (attribute-based, metaphor-based, and target-based), 4 studies tested the hypothesis that older people are the targets of animalistic dehumanization. Using an emotional attribution task, Study 1 (N = 112) explored infrahumanization and shows that young participants attributed more uniquely human emotions to young people than to older ones. No such effect occurred with regards to nonuniquely human emotions. Results of Study 2 (N = 62) replicated this result using a lexical-decision task. Using the metaphor-based approach, Study 3 (N = 99) confirmed that older people’s dehumanization is restricted to its animalistic form and does not extend to the mechanistic one. Finally, in Study 4 (N = 167), we used a target-based approach and showed that characteristics initially attributed to older people are perceived as denoting lesser humanness than when these same characteristics are associated with younger people. Results of the 4 studies provide evidence for an animalistic form of dehumanization of older people by younger ones. Limits, implications, and future research are discussed.

220,The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment,"Research on moral judgment has been dominated by rationalist models, in which moral judgment is thought to be caused by moral reasoning. The author gives 4 reasons for considering the hypothesis that moral reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather, moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached. The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it deemphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals and emphasizes instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions). The model is more consistent than rationalist models with recent findings in social, cultural, evolutionary, and biological psychology, as well as in anthropology and primatology.

221,"Gender dichotomization at the level of ingroup identity: What it is, and why men use it more than women","In 5 studies (N = 756), we show that men’s relative to women’s gender ingroup identities are characterized by greater levels of gender dichotomization, a tendency to distance masculine from feminine traits. We demonstrate further that men’s gender dichotomization is motivated, in part, by a need to eschew femininity from their ingroup identity to bolster a precarious gender status. Studies 1–3 establish and replicate the basic effect, and rule out alternative explanations (positivity, projection, status striving) for men’s tendency to dichotomize more than women. Studies 4 and 5 demonstrate the motivated nature of gender dichotomization by establishing that men, but not women, dichotomize more strenuously when reminded of the precariousness of their gender status, and report stronger motivation to restore their gender status upon learning that their ingroup is becoming less dichotomized. Across 3 studies, strength of identification with their gender group moderates men’s dichotomization tendencies. Discussion considers the implications of these findings for understanding the precarious nature of manhood and identifies practical applications of gender dichotomization in the interpersonal realm.

222,Working for a living: A terror management approach to finding meaning in vocation,"Many individuals spend approximately a third of their lives either working, receiving training or education for work or otherwise engaged in their career. While the current literature attempts to discern the many roles that work can play in our lives, it only scantly explore the existential nature of work in relation to death and mortality. Terror Management Theory provides a framework explaining how increases in awareness of our mortality influences our behavior and beliefs. By studying work constructs from the lens of Terror Management Theory, we seek to gain insight on the potential role that work plays in bolstering psychological resilience again existential stressors. We use an experimental design to observe power, work social-connectedness, self-determination, and work meaning as they relate to death anxiety between an experimental and control group. An experimental group received a mortality salience cue while the control group received a benign cue. Death anxiety was negatively correlated with work social-connectedness, self-determination and work meaning, but not perceived socio-economic status. None of the observed work constructs significantly moderated the magnitude of reported death anxiety. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Frazier, Julian T",1,,222
223,The heterogeneity of victim impact statements: A content analysis of capital trial sentencing penalty phase transcripts,"Victim impact statements ({VISs}) are controversial in capital sentencing proceedings largely due to their questionable relevance to sentencing, the concern that characterizations of the victim may lead to arbitrary sentencing judgments, and the belief that the emotional nature of this evidence may be inflammatory. A sample of 192 capital trial {VIS} transcripts was analyzed for content as well as a linguistic analysis of emotionality. The findings reveal that these statements are highly varied, including their format, length, and relation between the witness and the victim. Despite a legislative mandate that they address the emotional, financial, and physical suffering experienced by victim survivors, testimony of this nature occurs in a minority of the cases. Most commonly, these statements tend to characterize the victim and their qualities, relay the witness’ shock at first learning of the victim’s death (i.e., trauma narratives), and address the significance of the deceased to the family unit. In approximately one third of the transcripts reviewed, the witness made mention of the defendant, but this rarely included any mention of a desire for vengeance or recommended punishment. Linguistic analysis revealed that emotional content was prevalent throughout the testimony, with sadness emerging as more pervasive than anger. However, the degree of emotional language contained in these statements was not particularly high—and was comparable to that typically encountered in everyday life (e.g., newspapers, novels). Implications, particularly with regard to the potential for {VISs} to be considered inflammatory, are discussed.

224,"On the benign qualities of behavioral disinhibition: Because of the prosocial nature of people, behavioral disinhibition can weaken pleasure with getting more than you deserve","This article focuses on social situations in which people are surprised about what is happening and inhibited about how to respond to the situation at hand. We study these situations by examining a classic topic in social psychology: how people respond to receiving better outcomes than are deserved. In these situations, the actions of an authority or a coworker push in the direction of accepting and enjoying the unfair outcome, whereas personal values for most people push in the direction of rejecting or being displeased with the outcome. This conflict may inhibit people's response to the advantageous but unfair outcomes. If people are indeed inhibited about how to respond to these kinds of outcomes, then lowering behavioral inhibition by reminding people of having acted in the past without inhibitions (in a manner that is unrelated to the outcomes participants subsequently receive) should affect reactions to the outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesize that because many people are prosocial and want to adhere to principles of fairness, reminders of behavioral disinhibition will lead to less pleasure with the unfairly obtained outcomes. The results of 8 experiments (conducted both inside and outside the psychology laboratory) revealed evidence for this benign disinhibition effect on various reactions to outcomes that are better than deserved. In further accordance with our line of reasoning, the effect is particularly pronounced among those who adhere to a prosocial orientation or who have adopted a prosocial mindset and is not observed among those with proself orientations or mindsets.

The results revealed that individuals high in body esteem responded to mortality salience manipulations with increased identification with their physical bodies in Study 1 and with increased interest in sex in Study 2. Study 3 showed that reminders of death led to decreased appearance monitoring among appearance-oriented participants who were low in body esteem. These findings provide insight into why people often go to extreme lengths to meet cultural standards for the body and its appearance.

226,Appealing to fear: A meta-analysis of fear appeal effectiveness and theories,"Fear appeals are a polarizing issue, with proponents confident in their efficacy and opponents confident that they backfire. We present the results of a comprehensive meta-analysis investigating fear appeals’ effectiveness for influencing attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. We tested predictions from a large number of theories, the majority of which have never been tested meta-analytically until now. Studies were included if they contained a treatment group exposed to a fear appeal, a valid comparison group, a manipulation of depicted fear, a measure of attitudes, intentions, or behaviors concerning the targeted risk or recommended solution, and adequate statistics to calculate effect sizes. The meta-analysis included 127 articles (9\% unpublished) yielding 248 independent samples ({NTotal} = 27,372) collected from diverse populations. Results showed a positive effect of fear appeals on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, with the average effect on a composite index being random-effects d = 0.29. Moderation analyses based on prominent fear appeal theories showed that the effectiveness of fear appeals increased when the message included efficacy statements, depicted high susceptibility and severity, recommended one-time only (vs. repeated) behaviors, and targeted audiences that included a larger percentage of female message recipients. Overall, we conclude that (a) fear appeals are effective at positively influencing attitude, intentions, and behaviors; (b) there are very few circumstances under which they are not effective; and (c) there are no identified circumstances under which they backfire and lead to undesirable outcomes.

227,Vicarious belongingness: Effects of socioemotional commercials under mortality salience,"There is empirical evidence that mortality salience ({MS}) influences effects of advertisements. For instance, mere exposure to high-value goods can enhance cultural worldview and self-esteem and thus act as a buffer against existential anguish. Besides cultural worldview and self-esteem, close relationships can help to reduce existential anguish. Drawing upon terror management theory ({TMT}), the current study addressed the question of whether {MS} combined with emotional commercials influences perception of the ads as well as further behavior. We compared the effects of socioemotional versus informational ads after {MS} induction, measuring perceived emotionality of the ads, evaluation of ads and products, recall, and buying intention. Significant effects were found in all outcome variables, except for recall, supporting the hypothesis that under {MS} induction, commercials with a socioemotional content can enhance advertisement impact.

228,One size fits all? Contextualizing family-supportive supervision to help employees with eldercare responsibilities,"Eldercare can pose significant challenges for both employees and organizations wherein supervisors serve as critical linchpins. To better inform practitioners on how to assist employees with eldercare responsibilities, we investigated important work outcomes of eldercare-supportive supervision ({ESS}), a specific form of family-supportive supervision. Drawing on the job demands–resources model and social information processing theory, we framed {ESS} as a critical informational cue and an important job resource in employees’ immediate work environment that shapes employee work attitudes and behaviors. For this important segment of the workforce, we hypothesized that {ESS} could relate to employees’ job performance and time banditry through work engagement, and that caregiver burden would moderate these relationships such that the beneficial effects of {ESS} would be stronger for employees with high caregiver burden. Using a vignette-based experimental (between-person) design, Study 1 (N = 70) found that employees reported significantly higher work engagement in the high (vs. low) {ESS} condition. Study 2 supported the indirect effects of {ESS} on employee job performance and time banditry via work engagement in a field sample (N = 162) of nurses with eldercare responsibilities. In Study 3 (N = 257), using a 3-wave time-lagged design, we replicated our findings and further demonstrated the incremental validity of {ESS} above and beyond other relevant supports. Finally, we demonstrated that the effect of {ESS} on work engagement and the indirect effects of {ESS} on job performance and time banditry were stronger for employees with high (vs. low) caregiver burden. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Peng, Yisheng and Xu, Xiaohong and Matthews, Russell and Ma, Jie",0,,228
229,"Meaning is about mattering: Evaluating coherence, purpose, and existential mattering as precursors of meaning in life judgments","When people judge their lives as meaningful, what is this judgment about? Drawing on recent tripartite theoretical accounts of meaning in life ({MIL}), we tested the separate contributions of coherence (or comprehension), purpose, and existential mattering (or significance) as potential precursors of people’s self-reported evaluations of {MIL}. In Study 1 (N = 314 social media users), we developed brief acquiescence-free measures of these constructs, confirming that sense of coherence, purpose, mattering, and {MIL} judgments were distinct from each other and from related constructs (sense of control, belonging, self-esteem, self-competence, mood). In Study 2 (N = 168 students) and Study 3 (N = 442 Prolific Academic respondents; preregistered), we collected longitudinal data to test temporal relationships between coherence, purpose, mattering, and {MIL} judgments over a 1-month time lag. In both studies, sense of mattering consistently emerged as a significant precursor of {MIL} judgments, whereas sense of purpose and coherence did not. We conclude that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to the relatively neglected dimension of existential mattering, beyond their more common emphases on coherence or purpose as bases of meaningfulness.

230,"'Will to Exist, Live and Survive' ({WTELS}): Measuring its role as master/metamotivator and in resisting oppression and related adversities","The person’s agentic 'Will to Exist/Live and Survive' ({WTELS}) is overlooked in the literature. We proposed a measure as well as a conceptual predictive model for {WTELS}. The conceptual model included oppression and cumulative life adversities and {WTELS} as independent variables, existential annihilation anxieties ({EAA}), emotion regulation strategies, and self-esteem as mediating variables and psychopathology and posttraumatic growth ({PTG}) as outcome variables. The sample included 490 participants (age range: 14 to75, M = 26.03, {SD} = 10.90, 20.4\% adolescents, 58.6\% females) from three Egyptian cities that represented different regional cultures. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses tested the structural validity of the measure, Path analysis supplemented by {PROCESS} macro was used to test the predictive validity of the measure and the effect size for each mediator. Multigroup invariance analysis tested the invariance of the measurement and structural models. The developed measure was found to have good reliability, stability, and structural validity. Path analysis validated its predictive validity and indicated that {WTELS} had strong direct negative effects on {EAA} and the direct and indirect negative effects on psychopathology. Self-esteem and emotion regulation (reappraisal) were mediators of its indirect effects. {WTELS} had direct positive effects on {PTG} and direct and indirect positive effects on emotion regulation. {WTELS} had direct and indirect positive effects on self-esteem. Its indirect effects on self-esteem were mediated by reappraisal. The results indicated that both the measurement and the structural models of {WTELS} were strictly invariant across gender, regional, age, and religious groups. We further discussed the importance of developing {WTELS}-focused intervention and prevention programs.

231,Nostalgia and well-being in daily life: An ecological validity perspective,"Nostalgia is a mixed emotion. Recent empirical research, however, has highlighted positive effects of nostalgia, suggesting it is a predominantly positive emotion. When measured as an individual difference, nostalgia-prone individuals report greater meaning in life and approach temperament. When manipulated in an experimental paradigm, nostalgia increases meaning in life, self-esteem, optimism, and positive affect. These positive effects may result from the specific experimental procedures used and little is known about daily experiences that covary with nostalgia. To address this gap, we aimed to measure nostalgia in ecologically valid contexts. We created and validated the Personal Inventory of Nostalgic Experiences ({PINE}) scale (Studies 1a–1d) to assess both trait and state-based nostalgic experiences. When measured as an individual difference, the nomological net was generally negative (Study 2). When measured in daily life (Studies 3 and 4), nostalgia as a state variable was negatively related to well-being. Lagged analyses showed that state nostalgia had mixed effects on well-being at a later moment that day and negative effects on well-being on the following day. To reconcile the discrepancies between these studies and the positive effects of nostalgia from previous research, we showed that experimentally induced nostalgic recollections were rated more positively and less negatively than daily experiences of nostalgia (Study 5). These studies show that nostalgia is a mixed emotion; although it may be predominantly positive when nostalgic memories are generated on request, it seems predominantly negative when nostalgia is experienced in the course of everyday life.

232,Reactance to (or acceptance of) stereotypes: Implicit and explicit responses to group identity threat,"We propose that reactance to threats to individual freedom can be broadened to include threats to group identity and its associated values and norms. In two studies we primed women and men with (counter) stereotypical roles and measured implicit activation of reactance versus acceptance goals, task persistence, and support for system justification beliefs and collective action. Although we found no direct evidence of reactance activation, men activated acceptance when primed with gender stereotypes, whereas women did not. Further, traditional women legitimize the system after counter-stereotypical exposure, whereas progressive women (feminist identifiers) persist more in solving a task stereotypically favoring men under these conditions (Study 1). Finally, nonsexist women show higher support for collective action after stereotypical exposure when threat to their identity is blatant (Study 2). We argue that reactions to identity threats depend on the content of that identity so that the specific form reactance takes may depend on the group norms being threatened.

233,The impact of resource valence on children’s other-regarding preferences,"Given its importance for the emergence of intergroup conflict, the development of other-regarding preferences toward in-group and out-group members has received increasing attention from various disciplines. The present study investigates children’s other-regarding preferences toward in-group and out-group members when allocating resources with positive and negative valence. The 6- and 8-year-olds’ (N = 92) task was to allocate resources to themselves versus to an in-group or an out-group member. They demonstrated prosociality more frequently toward in-group than toward out-group recipients and more frequently when positive rather than negative resources were involved. Whereas the importance of the recipient’s group membership increased with participants’ age, the importance of resource valence decreased. Furthermore, older children, but not younger ones, were more prosocial toward in-group than out-group members in the allocation of negative resources. These findings help to understand the psychological determinants and the ontogenetic origins of other-regarding preferences toward in-group versus out-group members and, hence, individual engagement in intergroup conflict.

234,A terror management perspective on the role of death-related anxiety in psychological dysfunction,"Building on previous existential theorizing, terror management theory provides a unique approach to conceptualizing the development, maintenance, and impact of psychological disorders. The theory suggests that awareness of mortality creates the potential for anxiety, which is managed by an anxiety-buffering system consisting of one's cultural worldview, self-esteem, and interpersonal attachments. The pursuit of meaning, personal value, and interpersonal connections that motivates much human behavior is driven, in part, by the need to control this potential for death-related anxiety. This article provides an overview of terror management theory and a discussion of its implications for understanding clinical conditions, along with a review of research exploring the roles of death-related anxiety and the anxiety-buffering system in anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression.

235,Systems of meaning and transference: Implicit significant-other activation evokes shared reality,"Evidence shows that representations of significant others ({SOs}) are used in interpersonal relations—for example, in the social–cognitive process of transference (see Andersen \& Chen, 2002), a process that is assumed to serve meaning-making functions (Glassman \& Andersen, 1999b). Five studies tested the more specific notion that implicit activation of an {SO} representation in transference should indirectly activate the worldview shared with the {SO}, leading to its active pursuit, validation, and protection. Shared worldviews were assessed beforehand, both idiographically, as values (Studies 1 and 4), and nomothetically, as political ideology or religious beliefs (Studies 2, 3, and 5). In each experiment, participants learned about new persons, one subtly resembling their own {SO}. Transference was assessed (memory bias; positive evaluation; see Andersen, Reznik, \& Manzella, 1996) and, crucially, as predicted, when considering the new person resembling their {SO} (vs. the control persons), participants showed faster response latencies in a lexical decision task to words reflecting the worldview shared with the {SO} (vs. held only personally, Studies 1–3, or only by the {SO}, Study 3). With this person, they also anticipated a more meaningful interaction and actively socially tuned to the {SO}-shared worldview, selecting conversation topics reflecting the {SO}-shared worldview (vs. personally held or {SO}-held topics, Studies 1–3). Finally, threatening the {SO}-shared worldview with this person (vs. threatening personally held, {SO}-held, or irrelevant worldviews) prompted goal activation to restore the disrupted meaning (Studies 4 and 5), assessed by response latency in a lexical decision task. Transference thus evokes shared meaning systems and serves epistemic functions.

236,Faces in the face of death: Effects of exposure to life-threatening events and mortality salience on facial expression recognition in combat and noncombat military veterans,"Soldiers in war zones often experience life-threatening events that put their lives at stake. The present study examined how these exposures shape soldiers' social behavior, manifested by recognition of facial expressions. In addition, we investigated how explicit awareness of one's eventual death affects sensitivity to facial expressions. Veterans of elite military combat units were exposed to conditions of mortality or pain salience and later requested to label the emotions depicted in threatening and nonthreatening faces. Combat veterans were more accurate than noncombat veterans in identifying threatening expressions, both in mortality or pain salience induction (Experiment 1) or under no induction at all (Experiment 2). In addition, noncombat veterans primed with mortality salience identified fear expressions more accurately than those primed with pain salience. Finally, mortality salience improved accuracy for nonthreatening expressions for all veterans. The present results demonstrate that fear of death, resulting from exposure to concrete life-endangering perils or from thoughts on human's inevitable death, influences perception of facial expressions, which is critical for successful interpersonal communication.

237,Mining Twitter to detect hotspots in psychology,"For identifying psychological hotspot topics, a mere focus on bibliometric data suffers from a publication delay. To overcome this issue, we introduce Twitter mining of ongoing online communication among scientists for the detection of psychological research topics. Specifically, we collected the entire 69,963 tweets posted between August 2007 and July 2020 from 139 accounts of psychology professors, departments, and research institutes from the German-speaking countries, as well as sections of the German Psychological Society ({DGPs}). To examine whether Twitter topics are hotspots in terms of indicating future publication trends, 346,361 references in the {PSYNDEX} database were extracted. For determining the additional value of our approach in contrast to traditional conference analysis, we gathered all available conference programs of the {DGPs} and its sections since 2010 and compared dates of topic emergence. Results revealed 21 topics addressing societal issues (e.g., {COVID}-19), methodology (e.g., machine learning), scientific research (e.g., replication crisis), and different areas of psychological research. Ten topics indicated an increasing publication trend, particularly topics related to methodology or scientific transparency. Seven Twitter topics emerged earlier on Twitter than at conferences. A total of four topics could be expected neither by bibliometric forecasting nor conference contents: 'methodological issues in meta-analyses', 'playfulness', 'preregistration', and 'mobile brain/body imaging'. Taken together, Twitter mining is a worthwhile endeavor for identifying psychological hotspot topics, especially regarding societal issues, novel research methods, and research transparency in psychology. In order to get the most comprehensive picture of research hotspots, Twitter mining is recommended in addition to bibliometric analyses of publication trends and monitoring of conference topics.

238,The siren's call: Terror management and the threat of men's sexual attraction to women,"Why do sexually appealing women often attract derogation and aggression? According to terror management theory, women's sexual allure threatens to increase men's awareness of their corporeality and thus mortality. Accordingly, in Study 1 a subliminal mortality prime decreased men's but not women's attractiveness ratings of alluring women. In Study 2, mortality salience ({MS}) led men to downplay their sexual intent toward a sexy woman. In Study 3, {MS} decreased men's interest in a seductive but not a wholesome woman. In Study 4, {MS} decreased men's but not women's attraction to a sexy opposite-sex target. In Study 5, {MS} and a corporeal lust prime increased men's tolerance of aggression toward women.

In 2 experiments the current research explores how perceived threats to values affect antiatheist prejudices. In Experiment 1 we found that atheists were perceived to pose significantly greater threats to values, and elicit greater moral disgust, than other groups also perceived to pose values-related threats (gay men, Muslims). In Experiment 2 we randomly assigned participants to read either a news story detailing moral decline—priming values threats—or a control story. Following the values-threat prime, participants reported increased negative affect and greater discriminatory intentions toward atheists, but not toward students or other groups (gay men or people with {HIV}). Together, these experiments suggest that perceptions of threats to values are associated with, and negatively affect, antiatheist prejudice. We discuss our findings’ theoretical implications for a sociofunctional, threat-based approach to prejudice.

Building on cognitive priming research, we expose experimental groups to reminders of historical events and a control group to neutral pictures and captions. Attitudes of interest are assessed afterward. Differences between experimental and control groups indicate the current impact of thoughts of the event. Study 1 assessed how Muslims' political attitudes in Malaysia, Cameroon, and Israel are affected by the violent Iranian government crackdown following the 2009 presidential election and by President Obama's outreach to Islam (T. Holzman, June 4, 2009, Obama seeks 'New Beginning' with Muslim world. Washington, {DC}, National Public Radio). Study 2 assessed whether primes of Arab Spring uprisings (the wave of prodemocratic demonstrations and protests that occurred across the Arab World in early 2011) increased support for democracy among Tunisian Muslims. Both studies demonstrated effects of these events, supporting the utility of this method.

242,The relationship between materialism and personal well-being: A meta-analysis,"This meta-analysis investigates the relationship between individuals’ materialistic orientation and their personal well-being. Theoretical approaches in psychology agree that prioritizing money and associated aims is negatively associated with individuals’ well-being but differ in their implications for whether this is invariably the case. To address these and other questions, we examined 753 effect sizes from 259 independent samples. Materialism was associated with significantly lower well-being for the most widely used, multifaceted measures (materialist values and beliefs, r = −.19, ρ = −.24; relative importance of materialist goals, r = −.16, ρ = −.21), more than for measures assessing emphasis on money alone (rs = −.08 to −.11, ρs = −.09 to −.14). The relationship also depended on type of well-being outcome, with largest effects for risky health and consumer behaviors and for negative self-appraisals (rs = −.28 to −.44, ρs = −.32 to −.53) and weakest effects for life satisfaction and negative affect (rs = −.13 to −.15, ρs = −.17 to −.18). Moderator analyses revealed that the strength of the effect depended on certain demographic factors (gender and age), on value context (study/work environments that support materialistic values and cultures that emphasize affective autonomy), and on cultural economic indicators (economic growth and wealth differentials). Mediation analyses suggested that the negative link may be explained by poor psychological need satisfaction. We discuss implications for the measurement of materialist values and the need for theoretical and empirical advances to explore underlying processes, which likely will require more experimental, longitudinal, and developmental research.

243,Wiser reasoning and less disgust have the potential to better achieve suicide prevention,"Background: High school and university teachers need to advise students against attempting suicide, the second leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds. Aims: To investigate the role of reasoning and emotion in advising against suicide. Method: We conducted a study with 130 students at a university that specializes in teachers' education. Participants sat in front of a camera, videotaping their advising against suicide. Three raters scored their transcribed advice on 'wise reasoning' (i.e., expert forms of reasoning: considering a variety of conditions, awareness of the limitation of one's knowledge, taking others' perspectives). Four registered psychologists experienced in suicide prevention techniques rated the transcripts on the potential for suicide prevention. Finally, using the software Facereader 7.1, we analyzed participants' micro-facial expressions during advice-giving. Results: Wiser reasoning and less disgust predicted higher potential for suicide prevention. Moreover, higher potential for suicide prevention was associated with more surprise. Limitations: The actual efficacy of suicide prevention was not assessed. Conclusion: Wise reasoning and counter-stereotypic ideas that trigger surprise probably contribute to the potential for suicide prevention. This advising paradigm may help train teachers in advising students against suicide, measuring wise reasoning, and monitoring a harmful emotional reaction, that is, disgust.

244,Imagine all the forces: The impact of threatening news coverage on the willingness to militarily engage in the resurgence of the East versus West conflict,"A world divided into East versus West: The so-called Ukraine crisis has once more summoned outdated patterns of political thinking. Simultaneously, media discourses have flared up debating diplomatic and military solutions as possible policy responses. A majority of Germans, however, have remained hesitant to advocate any escalation of military conflict. We were interested in how far reputable journalism concerning the Ukraine crisis might activate a disposition toward military engagement. To evaluate the supposed impact of actual news coverage, we used explicit existential threats (mortality salience; {MS}) as a comparative measure. Typical effects of {MS} were derived from terror management theory ({TMT}), which predicts that the awareness of existential threats amplifies the efforts to defend one’s own culture, even by military means. We used a 2 × 2 factorial design (N = 112) with the factors article (original bellicose vs. neutral, nonmilitant depiction) and salience condition ({MS} vs. control). Results revealed a strong impact of the original, bellicose article, with increased willingness to deploy German forces at the Russian border, independently of the salience condition. Additional existential threats did not add further effects, as values for willingness were already very high. Classic effects regarding {TMT} were observed when people had read the Non-Militant article. Here, the willingness to deploy forces only increased after a confrontation with existential threats. We conclude that threatening news coverage on the Ukraine crisis has the ability to alter willingness for first-step military action at the Russian border by inducing effects that are – at least in their outcome – comparable to explicit existential threats.

245,The interactive effect of mortality reminders and tobacco craving on smoking topography,"Objective: Although fatal consequences of smoking are often highlighted in health communications, the question of how awareness of death affects actual smoking behavior has yet to be addressed. Two experiments informed by the terror management health model were conducted to examine this issue. Previous research suggests that the effects of mortality reminders on health-related decisions are often moderated by relevant individual difference or situational variables. Thus, a moderated effect was hypothesized here, and cigarette cravings were tentatively explored in this regard. Methods: In both studies, relatively light smokers completed a brief questionnaire about cigarette cravings, were reminded of their mortality or a control topic, and then smoked five puffs from a cigarette while the topography (i.e., volume, duration, and velocity) of their inhalations was recorded. Results: Significant craving × death reminder interactions emerged in both experiments. After reminders of mortality, stronger cravings predicted greater smoking intensity. Further, reminders of mortality increased smoking intensity for those with stronger cravings in both studies, and there was also some indication that mortality reminders decreased smoking intensity for those with weaker cravings. Conclusions: Although there are limitations in the present research's utilization of light smokers as opposed to heavy smokers, these findings indicate a nuanced effect of mortality reminders on smoking intensity and suggest that careful consideration needs to be given to when and how reminders of death are used in communications about smoking. The discussion also highlights the benefits of social psychologically informed theory for understanding health and smoking behavior.

246,Stereotypes and terror management: Evidence that mortality salience enhances stereotypic thinking and preferences,"If stereotypes function to protect people against death-related concerns, then mortality salience should increase stereotypic thinking and preferences for stereotype-confirming individuals. Study 1 demonstrated that mortality salience increased stereotyping of Germans. In Study 2, it increased participants' tendency to generate more explanations for stereotype-inconsistent than stereotype-consistent gender role behavior. In Study 3, mortality salience increased participants' liking for a stereotype-consistent African American and decreased their liking for a stereotype-inconsistent African American; control participants exhibited the opposite preference. Study 4 replicated this pattern with evaluations of stereotype-confirming or stereotype-disconfirming men and women. Study 5 showed that, among participants high in need for closure, mortality salience led to decreased liking for a stereotype-inconsistent gay man.

247,Opposing standards within the cultural worldview: Terror management and American women's desire for uniqueness versus inclusiveness,"Two different standards within American women's overall cultural worldview were examined in two studies: standing out and fitting in. American culture prescribes and values uniqueness, yet gender norms for women prescribe and value inclusiveness. Thus, unlike American men, American women encounter incongruent cultural norms that make it unclear which she will uphold when faced with thoughts of death. We hypothesized that, for women (and not men), gender salience would moderate worldview adherence. Using standard terror management manipulations, American women were subjected to a self or gender prime (Study 1) as well as a non-gender-group prime and compared to men (Study 2). Results showed that under mortality salience, women primed with gender identified more with their gender group, were more likely to behave inclusively, and were more likely to desire affiliation. In contrast, those primed with the self, a non-gender-group prime, as well as men, were more likely to desire uniqueness. These findings suggest that, for an American woman, both inclusiveness and uniqueness are responses to mortality salience, depending on her momentary reference point.

248,Does moral cleansing moderate the effect of evolutionary altruism on helping intention? An exploratory study,"There is strong evidence for social evolutionary motivations for helping (e.g., reciprocal altruism) and also growing support for the influence of the social cognitive theory of moral cleansing on prosociality. Where the former motivation is interpersonal, the latter is intrapersonal. This experimental study hypothesized that, in addition to main effects of evolutionary altruism and moral cleansing on helping intention, an interaction would occur between these theoretical motivations. Using three situational helping scenarios as dependent measures, the effect of participants’ morally-valenced recalled behavior (moral/immoral/achievement/failure) and the effect of their social proximity to a helping target (cousin/colleague/stranger) on helping intention was determined. Overall, 616 Australian participants (90.1\% female) completed the online experiment. Two-way {ANOVA} demonstrated a consistent main effect of social proximity on helping intention across all three helping scenarios, supporting evolutionary social psychological explanations for helping. However, instead of moral self-regulation effects, moral identity consistency effects were induced by the moral behavior recall manipulation. A main effect of behaviour recall on helping intention occurred, with moral recall increasing helping intention. The problem of theoretical ambiguity regarding moral identity consistency and moral self-regulation is discussed, as is the useful role of null result publications in informing effective experimental design.

249,Development of the Motivation to Participate in Psychological Research Scale,"In a series of four studies, I developed and found evidence supporting the validity of a new measure, the Motivation to Participate in Psychological Research Scale ({MPPRS}). Based upon the tenets of Self-Determination Theory and aimed at measuring motivation in undergraduate students, the scale demonstrated a three-factor structure in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (Study 1: N = 238, Study 2: N = 264, Study 3: N = 297). Factors corresponded to autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation. Preliminary evidence supported the validity of {MPPRS} scores, and subscales differentiated psychology majors from non-majors, as well as associated with the timing of research participation during the semester. Examining student motivation with the {MPPRS} has possible implications for data quality, as a moderator of research findings, and might be used to track changes in students’ interest regarding psychological research. However, future research is needed to assess the predictive validity of the {MPPRS}. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Freng, Scott",0,,249

We tracked changes in how different participants responded to dissimilar others from the night of bin Laden’s death for five weeks. Liberal participants reported lower worldview defense (i.e., a defensive reaction to uphold one’s cultural worldview) immediately after bin Laden’s death but then increased over time. Conservative participants reported greater worldview defense during each point of the study and did not significantly change over time. These temporal differences between liberals and conservatives were only present in the year of bin Laden’s death and not in a comparison sample (N = 329) collected 1 year prior. These findings demonstrate that the attitudes of liberals and conservatives may change in theoretically predictable ways following a major societal event.

Table 3 contained formatting errors. Minus signs used to indicate negative statistical estimates within the table were inadvertently changed to m-dashes. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The purpose of this meta-analysis was to address unanswered questions regarding the associations between personality and workplace safety by (a) clarifying the magnitude and meaning of these associations with both broad and facet-level personality traits, (b) delineating how personality is associated with workplace safety, and (c) testing the relative importance of personality in comparison to perceptions of the social context of safety (i.e., safety climate) in predicting safety-related behavior. Our results revealed that whereas agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively associated with unsafe behaviors, extraversion and neuroticism were positively associated with them. Of these traits, agreeableness accounted for the largest proportion of explained variance in safety-related behavior and openness to experience was unrelated. At the facet level, sensation seeking, altruism, anger, and impulsiveness were all meaningfully associated with safety-related behavior, though sensation seeking was the only facet that demonstrated a stronger relationship than its parent trait (i.e., extraversion). In addition, meta-analytic path modeling supported the theoretical expectation that personality’s associations with accidents are mediated by safety-related behavior. Finally, although safety climate perceptions accounted for the majority of explained variance in safety-related behavior, personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism) still accounted for a unique and substantive proportion of the explained variance. Taken together, these results substantiate the value of considering personality traits as key correlates of workplace safety.

252,A new approach to mortality salience: Can psychological flexibility mitigate death anxiety?,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) has showed that people respond to reminders of mortality by suppressing their thoughts about death, or denying their vulnerability, and then enhancing their sense of self-esteem and adhering to cultural worldviews that provide a sense of meaning in life. These mechanisms are effective, however, they are avoidance-based strategies, which can ultimately reinforce the very same death anxiety that people try to defend against. The present study proposed that another way in which the effects of mortality salience on death anxiety can be buffered is through psychological flexibility, which is the opposite of experiential avoidance. No previous study has assessed whether this acceptance-based mechanism moderates death anxiety. The present study examined the hypothesis that people with higher psychological flexibility (i.e. who avoid less), experience less death anxiety when reminded of their death. After measuring the psychological flexibility of 470 participants, they were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition (mortality salience) or control condition (dental pain salience). Then, their death anxiety was assessed. The first analyses showed the manipulation was not successful because measuring death anxiety, which entailed direct questions about death; ultimately reminded all participants of their mortality. Therefore the data was collapsed across conditions, which revealed that as predicted, participants with higher psychological flexibility experienced less death anxiety. Theoretical and applied clinical applications of these findings are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Valle Alerh and , Axel",1,,252
253,Cancer and the threat of death: The cognitive dynamics of death-thought suppression and its impact on behavioral health intentions,"Five studies examined the cognitive association between thoughts of cancer and thoughts of death and their implication for screening intentions. Study 1 found that explicit contemplation of cancer did not increase death-thought accessibility. In support of the hypothesis that this reflects suppression of death-related thoughts, Study 2 found that individuals who thought about cancer exhibited elevated death-thought accessibility under high cognitive load, and Study 3 demonstrated that subliminal primes of the word cancer led to increased death-thought accessibility. Study 4 revealed lower levels of death-thought accessibility when perceived vulnerability to cancer was high, once again suggesting suppression of death-related thoughts in response to conscious threats associated with cancer. Study 5 extended the analysis by finding that after cancer salience, high cognitive load, which presumably disrupts suppression of the association between cancer and death, decreased cancer-related self-exam intentions. Theoretical and practical implications for understanding terror management, priming and suppression, and responses to cancer are discussed.

254,Content validation guidelines: Evaluation criteria for definitional correspondence and definitional distinctiveness,"Several reviews have been critical of the degree to which scales in industrial/organizational psychology and organizational behavior adequately reflect the content of their construct. One potential reason for that circumstance is a tendency for scholars to focus less on content validation than on other validation methods (e.g., establishing reliability, performing convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validation, and examining factor structure). We provide clear evaluation criteria for 2 commonly used content validation approaches: Anderson and Gerbing (1991) and Hinkin and Tracey (1999). To create those guidelines, we gathered all new scales introduced in Journal of Applied Psychology, Academy of Management Journal, Personnel Psychology, and Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes from 2010 to 2016. We then subjected those 112 scales to Anderson and Gerbing’s (1991) and Hinkin and Tracey’s (1999) approaches using 6,240 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk with detailed, transparent, and replicable instructions. For both approaches, our results provide evaluation criteria for definitional correspondence—the degree to which a scale’s items correspond to the construct’s definition—and definitional distinctiveness—the degree to which a scale’s items correspond more to the construct’s definition than to the definitions of other orbiting constructs.

255,Parental attachment and internalizing and externalizing problems of Israeli school-goers and homeschoolers,"The increased scope and percentage of children being homeschooled raise questions about the impact of this framework on the child’s world. One of the issues that has not been adequately studied with regard to homeschooling is whether the emotional and personal problems of parents have greater impact on children who are homeschooled. The present research, conducted in Israel, examined this question from the perspective of attachment theory, which focuses on how people relate to intimate relationships. Previous research has shown an association between the attachment of parents and emotional and behavioral characteristics of their children. Against this background, the present research compared a group of homeschooling mothers and children with a group of mothers who sent their children to school (a total of 101 children; mean age, 9.2 years). These groups did not differ in age and socioeconomic status. The comparison focused on variables beyond these and also considered the degree of structure of the homeschooling practiced. The findings indicated a correlation between mother’s attachment anxiety and internalizing and externalizing problems of the child. However, no correlation was found between attachment avoidance and these problems, and no difference was found between the two groups in terms of these correlations. The results contribute, among other things, to understanding the association between homeschooling and behavioral and emotional problems.

256,"The relationship between elevation, connectedness, and compassionate love in meaningful films","Expanding on the research of meaningful entertainment media and its effects, this study investigated the relationship between experiences related to elevation responses to film. Whereas research thus far has focused primarily on portrayals of altruism to elicit elevation, the results of this study show that portrayals of connectedness, love, and kindness in meaningful films are also able to elicit feelings of elevation. Moreover, elevation mediated the relationship between meaningful films and feelings of connectedness toward the transcendent, close others, and toward one’s family; compassionate love toward close others; and compassionate motivation to love and be good to humanity. The study demonstrates the potential of meaningful films to increase experiences of connectedness to the transcendent, which ultimately can enhance our concern about the well-being of others, and motivation to be more compassionate even to strangers.

257,The quest for significance motivates self-sacrifice,"The present research examined the motivational underpinnings of self-sacrifice. Based on the quest for significance theory, we argue that individuals are propelled to self-sacrifice for a cause to achieve a sense of self-worth, particularly after experiencing a loss of significance. Results from 6 studies yielded support for this hypothesis. Using a correlational design, Study 1 found that decreases in significance were associated with greater readiness for self-sacrifice. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that experiences implicating negative self-worth increased the propensity for self-sacrifice controlling for positive and negative affect. Study 3 extended findings from Study 2 to a different context, and Study 4 demonstrated that failures in an important rather than a trivial domain increased individuals’ willingness to self-sacrifice for a cause. Study 5 found evidence that the search for significance mediates the relationship between significance loss and willingness to self-sacrifice. Finally, Study 6 provided evidence that self-sacrifice increased significance more than did pleasurable experiences, suggesting it is instrumental to significance restoration after loss. Findings are discussed in light of extant self-sacrifice literature and the quest for significance theory.

258,Crisis of meaning predicts suicidality in youth independently of depression,"Background: At times, the question for meaning comes to nothing and a crisis of meaning ensues. This state is very painful, but difficult to account. Both those who suffer from it and care professionals find themselves at a loss for words. Aims: This study introduces an operationalization of a crisis of meaning. It aims to distinguish the concept from depression, and to investigate whether a crisis of meaning can explain suicidality beyond the known protective and risk factors self-esteem, family functioning, life-event load, and depression. Method: Final-year school pupils in Ecuador (N = 300) completed questionnaires assessing the above variables. Data were analyzed using chi-square, hierarchic multiple regression, serial mediation, and moderator analyses. Results: Crisis of meaning was distinguished from depression. It explained a significant amount of variance in suicidality beyond the mentioned protective and risk factors. For males, crisis of meaning was the only significant risk factor, and the strongest predictor overall. The acute risk factors depression and crisis of meaning mediated the effects of the baseline factors self-esteem, family functioning, and life-event load on suicidality. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional; assessed factors predicted variance in suicidal thoughts, plans, and past suicide attempts, while their relevance cannot be generalized to actual future suicide attempts. Conclusion: A crisis of meaning is an important factor to take into account in further research on the prevention and treatment of people at risk of suicide.

Participants (N = 113) were randomly assigned to imagine themselves attending a religious small group that was ideologically homogeneous or diverse, and then they rated the amount of belonging and meaning they anticipated receiving from the group, as well as their level of intellectual humility. Being in an ideologically diverse small group was negatively associated with belonging and meaning, but intellectual humility moderated these relationships, such that the relationships were weaker at higher levels of intellectual humility. Thus, intellectual humility preserved a sense of meaning and belonging when individuals interacted with ideologically dissimilar others.

Fearful-avoidant individuals are characterized by both high anxiety and high avoidance. This study examines the response of individuals with fearful-avoidant attachment orientation to neutral, emotionally positive, or emotionally negative visual stimuli. Method: Participants included 119 undergraduate students (91 female), mean age 23.5 ± 3.6 years: 30 fearful-avoidant, 32 secure, 28 anxious-preoccupied, and 29 dismissive-avoidant. The response of individuals with fearful-avoidant attachment orientation to {IAPS} emotional and neutral pictures was measured using Event-Related Potential ({ERP}), and compared to individuals with dismissive-avoidance or anxious-preoccupied attachment orientations (with a secure attachment group as control). The study focused on early time reaction, as defined by the P1, N1, and P2 components (110–165, 165–215, and 215–280 ms poststimulus, respectively). Results: We find that individuals with fearful-avoidant attachment orientation display a reaction to emotional (positive or negative) cues, at the P1 and P2 components, that is significantly different than that of individuals with anxious-preoccupied attachment, but is similar to that of individuals with dismissive-avoidant attachment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the initial response to emotional stimuli of individuals with fearful-avoidant attachment is dominated by avoidance, rather than anxiety.

262,"The amoral atheist? A cross-national examination of cultural, motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, and their implications for morality","There is a widespread cross-cultural stereotype suggesting that atheists are untrustworthy and lack a moral compass. Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2–3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries. A consequentialist view of morality was also associated with another presumed antecedent of disbelief—analytic cognitive style.

The present study examined the impact of the selection procedure (with or without {AA}) on the perception of justice and on attitudes toward the beneficiaries of these procedures in France, where the system makes it possible to compare beneficiaries of different origins. A group of 101 French students read scenarios describing the admission of a candidate, with either a French or a North African first name, to a prestigious school, based on either a standard selection procedure or {AA}. The standard procedure and its beneficiary were more positively judged, and the beneficiary was considered more competent, than one selected with {AAP}. These results were particularly significant for participants with a high level of social dominance orientation ({SDO}). Furthermore, participants perceived both selection procedures more positively and judged the candidate as being more competent when that person had a French-sounding name.

Drawing on an analysis of the historic and current status of East Asians in North America, we study descriptive and prescriptive stereotypes of East Asians along the dimensions of competence, warmth, and dominance and examine workplace consequences of violating these stereotypes. Study 1 shows that East Asians are descriptively stereotyped as more competent, less warm, and less dominant than Whites. Study 2 shows that only the descriptive stereotype of East Asians as less dominant than Whites is also a prescriptive stereotype. Study 3 reveals that people dislike a dominant East Asian coworker compared to a nondominant East Asian or a dominant or a nondominant White coworker. Study 4 shows that East Asians who are dominant or warm are racially harassed at work more than nondominant East Asians and than dominant and nondominant employees of other racial identities.

Drawing upon literature from communication, political psychology, and humor research, we explain how the psychological profiles of conservatives may render them less motivated to process and appreciate certain forms of humor compared to liberals. We test these propositions with an experiment that employs a two condition within-subjects experiment on a national sample (N = 305) to assess appreciation and comprehension of ironic and exaggerated humor among liberals and conservatives. Mediating effects of psychological traits are tested. Findings suggest that conservatives are less appreciative of both irony and exaggeration than liberals. In both cases, the effect is explained in part by lower sense of humor and need for cognition found among conservative participants. Results are explored in terms of the implications for political discourse, political polarization, and democratic practices.

270,Feeling hangry? When hunger is conceptualized as emotion,"Many people feel emotional when hungry—or 'hangry'—yet little research explores the psychological mechanisms underlying such states. Guided by psychological constructionist and affect misattribution theories, we propose that hunger alone is insufficient for feeling hangry. Rather, we hypothesize that people experience hunger as emotional when they conceptualize their affective state as negative, high arousal emotions specifically in a negative context. Studies 1 and 2 use a cognitive measure (the affect misattribution procedure; Payne, Hall, Cameron, \& Bishara, 2010) to demonstrate that hunger shifts affective perceptions in negative but not neutral or positive contexts.

271,Moral expansiveness: Examining variability in the extension of the moral world,"The nature of our moral judgments—and the extent to which we treat others with care—depend in part on the distinctions we make between entities deemed worthy or unworthy of moral consideration—our moral boundaries. Philosophers, historians, and social scientists have noted that people’s moral boundaries have expanded over the last few centuries, but the notion of moral expansiveness has received limited empirical attention in psychology. This research explores variations in the size of individuals’ moral boundaries using the psychological construct of moral expansiveness and introduces the Moral Expansiveness Scale ({MES}), designed to capture this variation. Across 6 studies, we established the reliability, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the {MES}. Moral expansiveness was related (but not reducible) to existing moral constructs (moral foundations, moral identity, 'moral' universalism values), predictors of moral standing (moral patiency and warmth), and other constructs associated with concern for others (empathy, identification with humanity, connectedness to nature, and social responsibility). Importantly, the {MES} uniquely predicted willingness to engage in prosocial intentions and behaviors at personal cost independently of these established constructs. Specifically, the {MES} uniquely predicted willingness to prioritize humanitarian and environmental concerns over personal and national self-interest, willingness to sacrifice one’s life to save others (ranging from human out-groups to animals and plants), and volunteering behavior. Results demonstrate that moral expansiveness is a distinct and important factor in understanding moral judgments and their consequences.

272,Only believers rely on God? A new measure to investigate Catholic faith automatic associations and their relationship with psychological well-being,"Recent theorists have argued that theistic cognitions are so deeply embedded in human cultures that nearly all people experience implicit religious thoughts, even those who consider themselves as atheists or agnostics. This study aimed to evaluate the validity of a Catholic Faith Single Category Implicit Association Test ({CF} {SC}-{IAT}; Karpinski \& Steinman, 2006), the degree of implicit–explicit dissociation across different religious groups (practicing and nonpracticing Catholics, agnostics and atheists), as well as the relationships between automatic faith associations and well-being indices. The study was conducted using a Roman sample composed of 142 subjects (106 women) who were an average of 24.74 years of age ({SD} = 10.66). Results showed: (a) an adequate level of reliability and convergent and criterion validity; (b) a certain degree of implicit–explicit dissociation in terms of a different localization of mean scores with respect to the neutral scale point, a different pattern of means across the religious groups, a small correlation between them, and independent contributions in the prediction of religion-related behaviors; and (c) significant correlations between implicit Catholic faith and 3 different indices of psychological well-being. Theoretical interpretations and limitations of the study were discussed.

273,Why do people believe in a 'true self'? The role of essentialist reasoning about personal identity and the self,"Why do many people come to believe that they and others have a true self? We hypothesized that this belief emerges because people routinely rely on essentialist reasoning to understand personal identity and the self. Across eight studies, we found that (a) the features that participants attributed to the true self resembled the features typically attributed to essences (e.g., immutability, informativeness, inherence; Studies 1–4); (b) endorsement of belief in true selves correlated with endorsement of other essentialist beliefs (Study 5); and (c) experimental manipulations of essentialist beliefs in domains other than the self spilled over and affected participants’ endorsement of belief in true selves (Studies 6–8). These findings advance theory on the origins and functions of beliefs about the true self, suggesting that these beliefs are, in part, a specific downstream consequence of the broader tendency to explain phenomena in the world in terms of underlying essences.

274,"Attitude–behavior consistency, the principle of compatibility, and organ donation: A classic innovation","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 34(1) of Health Psychology (see record [rid]2014-57157-001[/rid]). The fifth sentence in the first paragraph of the Methods section should have read, 'The ethnically homogenous (7.0\% Hispanic, 8.9\% Asian-American, 0\% multiethnic, 75.4\% Caucasian, 6.7\% Black, .3\% Pacific Islander, 1.7\% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0\% other) sample consisted of mostly males (61.20\%), with an average age of 30.71 years ({SD} 11.46).' Also, in the General Discussion section, the sentence 'Specific attitudes explained between 70\% and 250\% more variance in registration behavior than general attitudes.' should have read 'Specific attitudes explained between 70\% and 150\% more variance in registration behavior than general attitudes.'] Objective: The lack of consistency between peoples’ attitudes toward organ donation and organ donation registration behavior has long perplexed scholars. Ajzen and Fishbein’s principle of compatibility offers a potential explanation for the attitude–behavior discrepancy. This principle states that attitudes will better predict behavior if the specificity of a measured attitude matches the specificity of the behavior under consideration. Method: Two studies, using different samples and different modes of data collection, measured general attitudes toward organ donation and specific attitudes toward registering as a donor, while simultaneously offering a registration opportunity. Results: Compared with general attitudes about organ donation, attitudes specific to organ donor registration were superior predictors of registration intentions and behaviors. Specific attitudes explained at least 70\% more variance in registration behaviors than general attitudes. Conclusion: The lack of attitude–behavior consistency in the organ donor domain can be partially explained by limited compliance with the principle of compatibility.

275,God and the government: Testing a compensatory control mechanism for the support of external systems,"The authors propose that the high levels of support often observed for governmental and religious systems can be explained, in part, as a means of coping with the threat posed by chronically or situationally fluctuating levels of perceived personal control. Three experiments demonstrated a causal relation between lowered perceptions of personal control and the defense of external systems, including increased beliefs in the existence of a controlling God (Studies 1 and 2) and defense of the overarching socio-political system (Study 4). A 4th experiment (Study 5) showed the converse to be true: A challenge to the usefulness of external systems of control led to increased illusory perceptions of personal control. In addition, a cross-national data set demonstrated that lower levels of personal control are associated with higher support for governmental control (across 67 nations; Study 3). Each study identified theoretically consistent moderators and mediators of these effects. The implications of these results for understanding why a high percentage of the population believes in the existence of God, and why people so often endorse and justify their socio-political systems, are discussed.

276,Mortality salience induces men's mating strategy toward body attractiveness in long-term mating context,"Sexual attitudes are influenced by social norms, with an open sexual attitude in loose cultures (e.g., United States), and a conservative sexual attitude in tight cultures (e.g., China). Previous studies have found that men prefer women's face in long-term mating context and prefer women's body in short-term mating context in loose culture. However, whether men in tight culture prefer women's body in one-night stand mating context is unknown. Moreover, previous studies have shown that mortality salience has an influence on human's reproductive behaviors, however, it is unclear how mortality salience affects men's mating preferences. Experiment 1 replicated the previous findings showing that men prefer women's face in long-term mating context (girlfriend), and prefer women's body in short-term mating context (one-night stand) in tight culture. Moreover, experiment 2 found that after priming with death, men in the long-term context prefer women's body more than that in control priming group, and they also rated higher importance of body in mating selection than that in control group. Our results suggested that mortality salience induces men's mating strategy toward body attractiveness in long-term mating context.

277,Creativity and terror management: Evidence that creative activity increases guilt and social projection following mortality salience,"The present research, based on the ideas of O. Rank (1932/1989) and E. Becker (1973), was designed to test the hypotheses that engaging in creative expression after personal mortality has been made salient will lead to both increased feelings of guilt and a desire to enhance social connectedness. In Study 1, the authors used a 2 (mortality salience vs control) × 2 (creative pretask vs noncreative pretask) between Ss factorial design and measured self-report guilt. Results indicated that participants who were reminded of their death and completed the creative pretask expressed more guilt than all other participants. In Study 2 this effect was replicated with a modification of the creativity treatment. In Study 3, the same conditions leading to increased guilt also led mortality-salient creative-task participants to express higher levels of social projection, an index of perceived social connectedness. Implications of these results for creativity, the interpersonal nature of guilt, and terror management theory are briefly discussed.

Seven studies tested variations of the hypothesis that simple, benign interpretations of social information function, in part, to manage death-related anxiety. In Studies 1-4, mortality salience ({MS}) exaggerated primacy effects and reliance on representative information, decreased preference for a behaviorally inconsistent target among those high in personal need for structure ({PNS}), and increased high-{PNS} participants' preference for interpersonal balance. In Studies 5-7, {MS} increased high-{PNS} participants' preference for interpretations that suggest a just world and a benevolent causal order of events in the social world.

279,A school-based intervention for reducing posttraumatic symptomatology and intolerance during political violence,"Studies indicate that individuals who are exposed to political violence and who experience personal threat and posttraumatic distress might also develop prejudicial and exclusionist attitudes toward outgroup members. To tackle this destructive dynamics in children, the authors implemented a 2-pronged approach, combining stress-reduction interventions with strategies geared to reducing stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward the other. A teacher-delivered universal school-based program, {ERASE}-Stress-Pro-Social ({ESPS}), was designed and implemented with Jewish Israeli students exposed to the 2008 Gaza War. Two hundred students from third to sixth grade were assigned to either 16 sessions of {ESPS} intervention (n = 99) or to a regular social skills ({SS}) program as a control group (n = 101). They were assessed on posttraumatic symptomatology ({PTS}), anxiety, somatic complaints, and functional problems, as well as stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward White, Arab, and Ethiopian children at 2 time-points: before the intervention and 2 months later. Elementary school students exposed to security threats and war exhibited significant levels of {PTS} distress as well as stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward Arab and Ethiopian children. Two months after the program ended, students in the {ESPS} group showed significant reduction on all measures compared to the {SS} group. Results show a strong link between {PTS} reduction and changes in attitudes toward Arabs. The {ESPS} program might help reduce {PTS} as well as prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory tendencies toward minorities in children exposed to political violence, thereby helping to preserve the democratic values and the delicate fabric of our multicultural societies.

280,Administrator blindness affects the recording of eyewitness lineup outcomes,"Objective: We investigated the effects of administrator knowledge of suspect identity in a lineup (blind vs. nonblind), witness identification (suspect vs. filler), and witness confidence (high vs. low) on whether administrators recorded the identification as an affirmative response; whether administrators recorded qualitative notes regarding the lineup task; and the content of those qualitative notes. Hypotheses: We predicted that nonblind administrators would record more identifications of the suspect than the filler, but blind administrators would record such identifications at comparable rates. We predicted this difference would be larger in the low (vs. high) confidence condition. We examined effects on administrators’ qualitative notes in an exploratory fashion. Method: Undergraduate participant administrators (N = 488) presented a lineup to a confederate witness (who made a scripted identification decision) and completed a record of the lineup task. Results: Nonblind administrators recorded 25\% fewer identifications of fillers (vs. suspects), and evaluated witnesses less favorably in the filler (vs. suspect) identification condition (ηp² = .194). Blind administrators were not influenced by witness selection. Blind (vs. nonblind) administrators recorded more qualitative notes, confidence statements, and information relevant to witnesses’ decision processes, regardless of whether witnesses identified the suspect or the filler. Among those who recorded a confidence statement, nonblind administrators’ characterizations were biased such that independent coders judged witnesses to be more confident in their identifications of the suspect (vs. filler). Conclusion: Blind administration eliminates numerous biases associated with administrator expectations and may yield more informative lineup records. These results further support blind lineup reform recommendations. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Rodriguez, Dario N. and Berry, Melissa A.",0,,280

This study sought to examine the {TMT} approach to understanding clinical anxiety while addressing several methodological limitations associated with the existing empirical literature.{MethodSemi}-structured diagnostic interviewing was employed to recruit two groups of participants with either Social Anxiety Disorder or no anxiety diagnosis. All participants were randomly allocated to receive either mortality salience or control priming, before undertaking two tasks designed to measure social and physical anxiety symptoms, respectively.{ResultsThe} overall pattern of results failed to provide evidence in support of the novel hypotheses derived from {TMT}. Mortality salience priming did not exacerbate social anxiety symptoms for participants with Social Anxiety Disorder, but did exacerbate physical anxiety symptoms for these individuals.

282,Controlled motivational orientation and prejudice: The mediating role of dehumanization,"This research investigates the effect of controlled versus autonomous motivation on intergroup relations. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 (N = 152 Greek Cypriot undergraduate students) showed that controlled motivational orientation, measured as a personality variable, was related to more prejudicial beliefs toward outgroups, lower intrinsic motives for contact, less desire for contact, and less actual contact with outgroups. Study 2 (N = 93 Greek Cypriot undergraduate students) experimentally replicated the findings of Study 1, revealing that controlled motivation, manipulated as a social/situational variable, was related to a higher level of prejudice toward outgroups, less intrinsic motives for contact with outgroups, and less desire for contact with outgroups. Most importantly, these relationships were mediated by dehumanization (i.e., denial of uniquely human traits) of the outgroup. The findings highlight the role of interpersonal control as an important factor determining the quality of intergroup relations.

283,Terror management and attributions of blame to innocent victims: Reconciling compassionate and defensive responses,"In this article, 4 studies test the hypothesis that reminders of personal death bias the normative attribution process and increase the motivation to blame severely injured, innocent victims. In Studies 1 and 2, primes of death led to greater attributions of blame to severely injured victims but did not significantly influence attributions of blame to either mildly injured victims or negatively portrayed others. In Study 3, primes of death led to greater attributions of blame to victims of circumstance but did not influence attributions of blame to victims who were explicitly responsible for their condition. In Study 4, innocent victims who were severely injured elicited more death-related cognitions than did victims who were responsible for their condition or who were only mildly injured. These findings indicate that the predictions of normative models of attribution may be moderated, and even overturned, when observers are reminded of their personal death such that defensive needs override rational inferential processes.

284,Self-esteem and cultural worldview buffer mortality salience effects on responses to self-face: Distinct neural mediators,"Terror management theory proposes cultural worldview and self-esteem as two buffers against death anxiety. The neural mediators of these buffering effects, however, have not been fully understood. The present work investigated neural mediation mechanisms between self-esteem/cultural trait (self-construal) and mortality salience ({MS}) effects on self-face processing. We found that {MS} (vs. {NA}) priming eliminated self-face advantage in behavioral judgments of face-orientation in low self-esteem individuals and reduced self-face advantage in behavioral judgments of facial-familiarity in individuals with high interdependent self-construals. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) results showed that, following {MS} priming, insular activities mediated the relationship between self-esteem and self-face advantage in face-orientation judgments, whereas dorsal medial prefrontal activity mediated the relationship between interdependent self-construal and self-face advantage in face-familiarity judgments. Our findings suggest that distinct neural mechanisms are engaged in mediating the relationships between self-esteem/cultural trait and {MS} effects on the emotional and cognitive processes of self-relevant information.

285,'We didn’t talk about the conflict': The birthright trip’s influence on Jewish Americans’ understanding of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict,"Emerging adulthood is a time of identity exploration during which youth actively engage with beliefs and values that shape their political orientation. In this study, we examine the processes and consequences of young adults’ exploration of their Jewish identity as it is embedded in the Birthright trip (a free 10-day trip to Israel that is offered to Jewish American emerging adults). In a pretrip/posttrip survey, we found significant increases in Birthright participants’ endorsement of the Jewish root narrative on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (Jewish people want to live in peace but must defend themselves), disavowal of the Palestinian narrative and understanding of the conflict, sense of collective victimhood, and understanding of the conflict as a zero-sum game. In a separate interview study, participants’ narratives of the trip suggested that identification with the Israeli soldiers as being 'just like us' as well as border-making between safe (Jewish) and unsafe (Arab) spaces, led to an understanding of the conflict that was based on the Jewish root narrative. Our findings highlight some less examined consequences of identity exploration among emerging adults who are members of groups enmeshed in violent conflict.

286,The 5-Factor Disgust Scale: Development and validation of a comprehensive measure of disgust propensity,"For years, disgust was conceptualized as a disease-avoidance mechanism. However, research shows that socio-moral or sexual transgressions elicit disgust, too. Until now, no German-language disgust scale has covered all disgust factors discussed in the literature. Here we present an economic Five-Factor Disgust Scale (5-{FES}; Fünf-Faktoren Ekelskala) along with empirical evidence from three studies corroborating its reliability and validity. Two well-established disgust questionnaires were combined and extended with other disgust-relevant items. Using item reduction and exploratory factor analysis, death-related, moral, food-related, sexual, and pathogen disgust emerged as distinct factors (Study 1: N = 456). Confirmatory factor analysis with two large samples (Study 2: N = 997 and N = 405) demonstrated a good fit of the correlated five-factor solution. The 5-{FES} correlated weakly with neuroticism, anxiety, and social desirability. A high negative correlation between sexual disgust and sexual openness emerged. Criterion validity was shown using self-reported behaviors (Study 3: N = 203). With food-related disgust comprising items about non-spoiled but exotic foods, a new disgust domain emerged. Results indicate that the 5-{FES} is a comprehensive and psychometrically sound German-language instrument for the differentiated assessment of disgust propensity.

287,People judge male sexism more leniently when women emasculate men,"While overt sexism has become less acceptable in recent years, sexism frequently goes unchallenged by observers for a variety of reasons. In the present investigation, we propose that people may excuse men’s sexist remarks when the remarks follow a manhood threat caused by a woman. In Study 1, we found that a man’s sexist remark buffered against the emasculating effect of a threat to his masculinity from an ex-girlfriend. In Study 2, we further show that observers excuse a man’s sexist remark following a competitive loss to a woman to the extent that they perceive him as less manly as a result. We replicate this finding in Study 3 while ruling out two competing explanations. We discuss the implication that sexism prevention efforts need to identify and address gender-related contexts where sexism is excused in order for efforts to move toward its prevention.

288,Securing the future: Threat to self-image spurs financial saving intentions,"This research examines when and why a threat to self-image influences saving intentions. Data from a set of seven studies, comprising a large-scale survey and 6 experiments, show that when individuals experience a self-image threat, they generate negative expectations about their future. Consequently, these individuals show a greater propensity to save money compared with nonthreatened individuals. We demonstrate that this effect diverges from the effects of environmental threats (e.g., resource scarcity) on saving, and find that it is more likely to occur among individuals with strong rather than weak beliefs in the instrumentality of money. Finally, we observe that the relationship between self-image threat and saving intentions is attenuated under the following conditions: (a) when individuals are induced to adopt positive future expectations; (b) when individuals perceive themselves as having abundant social connections, a perception that buffers their anxiety about the future; or (c) when individuals’ attention is directed, through self-affirmation, to important aspects of their lives that are irrelevant to the threat.

289,Pain offset reduces rumination in response to evoked anger and sadness,"Four studies examined whether pain offset reduces rumination in response to anger or sadness. Past research has demonstrated that, following the offset of pain, individuals show a distinct state of relief involving both reduction in negative affect and an increase in positive affect. This response may help to explain why people sometimes seek out pain and discomfort (e.g., vigorous exercise, self-harm) to regulate negative emotion and suggests that following pain people should recover better from negative emotional states. To test this, we examined ruminative responses to anger and sadness. These negative, approach-related emotions often produce rumination; a response that is generally considered maladaptive. In Study 1, pain was manipulated through a cold pressor task, and participants were induced to experience anger through autobiographical recall. In Study 2, pain was also manipulated pain via a cold pressor task, and anger and sadness were induced through social exclusion using the Cyberball paradigm. In Study 3, pain was manipulated by squeezing exercise handgrips, and sadness was induced with imagery from a sad video. Study 4 replicated the methods of Study 3 and added measures of relief and distraction to examine whether these moderated the effect. A minimeta-analysis showed that, across all studies, individuals engaged in less rumination in the pain conditions as measured by a thought-listing task and a self-reported rumination questionnaire. These results suggest that the regulation of anger and sadness are improved following pain offset.

Four studies are presented that, combined with existing evidence, support the prediction derived from the model that threats to one component of the security system result in compensatory defensive activation of other components. Further, the authors predicted and found that individual differences in attachment style moderate the defenses. In Studies 1 and 2, attachment threats motivated worldview defense among anxiously attached participants and motivated self-enhancement (especially among avoidant participants), effects similar to those caused by mortality salience. In Studies 3 and 4, a worldview threat and a self-esteem threat caused attachment-related proximity seeking among fearful participants and avoidance of proximity among dismissing participants. The authors' model provides an overarching framework within which to study attachment, self-esteem, and worldviews.

The present research explored whether the awareness of mortality (a common theme in politics, e.g., war/terrorism, health care, abortion, and so on) and tolerance salience might influence (1) the endorsement of anti‐Islamic attitudes in American politics and (2) political orientation. Study 1 (n = 79) was conducted in lab and Study 2 (preregistered, n = 396) replicated it online; both obtained the same results. In a neutral‐value‐prime condition, American participants reminded of mortality (vs. control topic) more strongly endorsed a Congressman’s anti‐Islamic statements about Rep. Ellison. However, in a tolerance‐value‐prime condition, participants reminded of mortality maintained their acceptance of Rep. Ellison’s beliefs and practices. Political orientation was not impacted.

292,The influence of mortality reminders on cultural in‐group versus out‐group takeaway food safety perceptions during the covid‐19 pandemic,"During the early stages of the {COVID}‐19 pandemic takeaway food orders generally increased, yet sales of Chinese and Italian food declined. At this time, news sources ran stories on the safety of cuisine from these countries, frequently juxtaposed with communications on mortality‐related information related to the virus. Terror management theory suggests mortality concerns can lead people to defend against the psychological threat of death by bolstering positive evaluations of products and values of their own culture, and by disparaging products and values of other cultures. This translates to food preferences, with death reminders heightening consumption of food from one's own (vs. others’) culture. However, whether this extends to food safety perceptions has not yet been probed. In the present experimental study, we examine whether death reminders (vs. a control topic) led U.S. participants to view American takeaway food as safer to consume, relative to Chinese and Italian food. Results indicate that across conditions, American food was evaluated as safer relative to Chinese and Italian takeout. Further, American takeaway was seen as safer after mortality reminders (vs. a control topic), with no differences in safety evaluations for Chinese or Italian takeout.

Robustly, women opposed group-based hierarchy more than men did, and members of lower power ethnic/racial groups opposed group-based hierarchy more than members of higher power ethnic/racial groups did. As predicted by social dominance theory, gender differences were larger, more stable, and less variable from sample to sample than differences between ethnic/racial groups. Subordinate gender and ethnic/racial group members disagreed more with dominants in their views of group-based hierarchy in societies that can be considered more liberal and modern (e.g., emphasizing individualism and change from traditions), as well as in societies that enjoyed greater gender equality. The relations between gender and ethnic/racial groups are discussed, and implications are developed for social dominance theory, social role theory, biosocial theory, social identity theory, system justification theory, realistic group conflict theory, and relative deprivation theory.

294,"Don’t fear the reaper: Trait death anxiety, mortality salience, and occupational health","Despite multiple calls for research, there has been little effort to incorporate topics regarding mortality salience and death anxiety into workplace literature. As such, the goals of the current study were to (a) examine how trait differences in death anxiety relate to employee occupational health outcomes and (b) examine how death anxiety might exacerbate the negative effects of mortality salience cues experienced at work. In Study 1, we examined how death anxiety affected nurses in a multitime point survey. These results showed that trait death anxiety was associated with increased burnout and reduced engagement and that death anxiety further exacerbated the relationship between mortality salience cues (e.g., dealing with injured and dying patients) and burnout. These results were replicated and extended in Study 2, which examined the impact of death anxiety in firefighters. In this multitime point study, death anxiety related to burnout, engagement, and absenteeism. The results further showed that death anxiety moderated the relationship between mortality cues and burnout, where people high in trait death anxiety experience higher levels of burnout as a result of mortality cues than people lower in death anxiety. Across the 2 studies, despite differences in the methods (e.g., time lag; measures), the effect sizes and the form of the significant interactions were quite similar. Overall, these results highlight the importance of understanding death anxiety in the workplace, particularly in occupations where mortality salience cues are common. We discuss recommendations, such as death education and vocational counseling, and provide some avenues for future research.

We test this moderated mediation model with data from three studies involving different sources collected across various measurement periods. Results corroborated our predictions by showing (a) a significant association between abusive supervision and subordinates’ fear, (b) second-stage moderation effects of subordinates’ assertiveness and their individual perceptions of a climate of fear in the abusive supervision–fear–defensive silence relationship (with lower assertiveness and higher levels of climate-of-fear perceptions exacerbating the detrimental effects of fear resulting from abusive supervision), and (c) first-stage moderation effects of subordinates’ assertiveness and climate-of-fear perceptions in a model linking fear to defensive silence and abusive supervision at a later time.

Across 5 studies, all 12 {SDS} items loaded strongly onto a single factor, with peaceful diplomacy at one pole and militarism at the other. The {SDS} was associated with authoritarianism (Studies 1-4) and dogmatism (Study 4), as well as measures of religious fundamentalism, immigration attitudes, universalism, and environmentalism (Study 2). In Study 3, the {SDS} mediated the relation between just peacemaking and measures of (a) voting intentions prior to the 2008 Presidential election, (b) militarism, and (c) resistance to moral disengagement from war. The {SDS} also predicted voting behavior in the 2008 Presidential election (Study 4) and mediated the relation between political orientation and foreign policy attitudes toward Iran (Study 5).

297,"Adjusting to death: The effects of mortality salience and self-esteem on psychological well-being, growth motivation, and maladaptive behavior","This research builds on terror management theory to examine the relationships among self-esteem, death cognition, and psychological adjustment. Self-esteem was measured (Studies 1–2, 4–8) or manipulated (Study 3), and thoughts of death were manipulated (Studies 1–3, 5–8) or measured (Study 4). Subsequently, satisfaction with life (Study 1), subjective vitality (Study 2), meaning in life (Studies 3–5), positive and negative affect (Studies 1, 4, 5), exploration (Study 6), state anxiety (Study 7), and social avoidance (Study 8) were assessed. Death-related cognition (a) decreased satisfaction with life, subjective vitality, meaning in life, and exploration; (b) increased negative affect and state anxiety; and (c) exacerbated social avoidance for individuals with low self-esteem but not for those with high self-esteem. These effects occurred only when death thoughts were outside of focal attention. Parallel effects were found in American (Studies 1–4, 6–8) and Chinese (Study 5) samples.

299,The {COVID}-19 pandemic and treating suicidal risk: The telepsychotherapy use of {CAMS},"The {COVID}-19 pandemic has created profound challenges for health care systems worldwide. The exponential spread of {COVID}-19 has forced mental health providers to find new ways of providing mental health services that maintain physical distance and keeps providers and patients at home limiting possible exposure to the deadly virus. The pandemic has thus sparked a sudden interest in providing mental health services via telepsychotherapy (otherwise known as telehealth or telemedicine). Telepsychotherapy care has some inherent challenges that must always be mastered by providers to render effective care. Previous research and professional guidelines understandably note possible concerns about providing telepsychotherapy care to high-risk suicidal patients in a remote location. The coronavirus pandemic now poses all new ethical concerns about the routine practice of having an acutely suicidal patient go to an emergency department and/or admitting such patients to an inpatient psychiatric unit (if the public health goal is to limit the spread of this deadly virus). To this end, this article describes a pandemic-driven effort to rapidly provide support, guidance, and resources to providers around the world to use a suicide-focused and evidence-based intervention called the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality ({CAMS}) within a telepsychotherapy modality. Additional suicide-relevant resources are being made available to provide further guidance and support to mental health professionals worldwide. In the midst of a global pandemic, there are emerging ways to help reduce further loss of life to suicide through the medium of telepsychotherapy to provide effective clinical care that is suicide-focused and evidence-based.

300,{CAD} or {MAD}? Anger (not disgust) as the predominant response to pathogen-free violations of the divinity code,"The {CAD} triad hypothesis (Rozin, Lowery, Imada, \& Haidt, 1999) stipulates that, cross-culturally, people feel anger for violations of autonomy, contempt for violations of community, and disgust for violations of divinity. Although the disgust−divinity link has received some measure of empirical support, the results have been difficult to interpret in light of several conceptual and design flaws. Taking a revised methodological approach, including use of newly validated (Study 1), pathogen-free violations of the divinity code, we found (Study 2) little evidence of disgust-related phenomenology (nausea, gagging, loss of appetite) or action tendency (desire to move away), but much evidence of anger-linked desire to retaliate, as a major component of individuals’ projected response to 'pure' (pathogen-free) violations of the divinity code. Study 3 replicated these results using faces in lieu of words as a dependent measure. Concordant findings emerged from an archival study (Study 4) examining the aftermath of a real-life sacred violation—the burning of Korans by U.S. military personnel. Study 5 further corroborated these results using continuous measures based on everyday emotion terms and new variants of the divinity—pure scenarios featuring sacrilegious acts committed by a theologically irreverent member of one’s own group rather than an ideologically opposed member of another group. Finally, a supplemental study found the anger-dominant attribution pattern to remain intact when the impious act being judged was the judge’s own. Based on these and related results, we posit anger to be the principal emotional response to moral transgressions irrespective of the normative content involved.

301,A little piece of me: When mortality reminders lead to giving to others,"Past research demonstrates that reminders of one’s own mortality can lead to materialistic and self-serving consumer behaviors. In contrast, across five studies, we explore a condition under which mortality salience ({MS}) leads to increased tendency to give away one’s possessions—when the donation act is high in transcendence potential. We propose and find that consumers are more likely to donate their possessions to charity under {MS} (vs. comparison conditions) when the product is considered highly (vs. not highly) connected to the self. Moreover, we demonstrate that this tendency manifests only when transcendence is attainable through donation. In support of the proposition of transcendence as the underlying mechanism, the observed effects are attenuated under conditions where: (1) transcendence has already been satiated via alternative means or (2) the donated possession will not transcend the self (i.e., its physical integrity is lost by being broken down and recycled).

302,Why group apologies succeed and fail: Intergroup forgiveness and the role of primary and secondary emotions,"It is widely assumed that official apologies for historical transgressions can lay the groundwork for intergroup forgiveness, but evidence for a causal relationship between intergroup apologies and forgiveness is limited. Drawing on the infrahumanization literature, we argue that a possible reason for the muted effectiveness of apologies is that people diminish the extent to which they see outgroup members as able to experience complex, uniquely human emotions (e.g., remorse). In Study 1, Canadians forgave Afghanis for a friendly-fire incident to the extent that they perceived Afghanis as capable of experiencing uniquely human emotions (i.e., secondary emotions such as anguish) but not nonuniquely human emotions (i.e., primary emotions such as fear). Intergroup forgiveness was reduced when transgressor groups expressed secondary emotions rather than primary emotions in their apology (Studies 2a and 2b), an effect that was mediated by trust in the genuineness of the apology (Study 2b). Indeed, an apology expressing secondary emotions aroused no more forgiveness than a no-apology control (Study 3) and less forgiveness than an apology with no emotion (Study 4). Consistent with an infrahumanization perspective, effects of primary versus secondary emotional expression did not emerge when the apology was offered for an ingroup transgression (Study 3) or when an outgroup apology was delivered through an ingroup proxy (Study 4). Also consistent with predictions, these effects were demonstrated only by those who tended to deny uniquely human qualities to the outgroup (Study 5). Implications for intergroup apologies and movement toward reconciliation are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Wohl, Michael J.

However, when the in-group is framed negatively, mortality salience should lead to disidentification. Study I found that mortality salience increased women's perceived similarity to other women except under gender-based stereotype threat. In Study 2, mortality salience and a negative ethnic prime led Hispanic as well as Anglo participants to derogate paintings attributed to Hispanic (but not Anglo-American) artists. Study 3 added a neutral prime condition and used a more direct measure of psychological distancing. Mortality salience and the negative prime led Hispanic participants to view themselves as especially different from a fellow Hispanic.

304,The anxiety-buffering function of close relationships: Evidence that relationship commitment acts as a terror management mechanism,"Three studies examined the terror management function of romantic commitment. In Study 1 (N=94), making mortality salient led to higher reports of romantic commitment on the Dimensions of Commitment Inventory (J. M. Adams \& W. H. Jones, 1997) than control conditions. In Study 2 (N=60), the contextual salience of thoughts about romantic commitment reduced the effects of mortality salience on judgments of social transgressions. In Study 3 (N=100), the induction of thoughts about problems in romantic relationships led to higher accessibility of death-related thoughts than did the induction of thoughts about either academic problems or a neutral theme. The findings expand terror management theory, emphasizing the anxiety-buffering function of close relationships.

305,The individual risk assessment of terrorism,"I attempt to identify the central conceptual and methodological challenges that must be overcome if the risk assessment of terrorism is to make the same progress that in recent years has distinguished the risk assessment of other forms of violence. Four principal conclusions are offered. First, clarity from the outset on what is being assessed—the risk of terrorism in the aggregate, or of specific types of terrorism, or of specific phases in the process of becoming a terrorist, or of specific roles in terrorist activity—is a prerequisite to progress in research. Second, one current approach to the risk assessment of more common violence (e.g., assault)—the approach known as structured professional judgment—usefully may be applied to the risk assessment of terrorism. However, given that many known risk factors for common violence are in fact not risk factors for violent terrorism, the substantive content of any instrument to assess the risk of terrorism will be very different from the substantive content of current instruments that address common violence. Third, since there is little existing evidence supporting the nontrivial validity of any individual risk factors for terrorism, the highest priority for research should be the identification of robust individual risk factors. Promising candidates include ideologies, affiliations, grievances, and 'moral' emotions. Finally, it is highly unlikely that an instrument to assess the risk of terrorism can be validated prospectively. An infrastructure for facilitating access to known groups of terrorists and nonterrorists from the same populations may be crucial for conducting a program of scientifically rigorous and operationally relevant research on the individual risk assessment of terrorism.

306,Modern anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli attitudes,"Anti-Semitism is resurgent throughout much of the world. A new theoretical model of anti-Semitism is presented and tested in 3 experiments. The model proposes that mortality salience increases anti-Semitism and that anti-Semitism often manifests as hostility toward Israel. Study 1 showed that mortality salience led to greater levels of anti-Semitism and lowered support for Israel. This effect occurred only in a bogus pipeline condition, indicating that social desirability masks hostility toward Jews and Israel. Study 2 showed that mortality salience caused Israel, but no other country, to perceptually loom large. Study 3 showed that mortality salience increased punitiveness toward Israel’s human rights violations more than it increased hostility toward the identical human rights violations committed by Russia or India. Collectively, results suggest that Jews constitute a unique cultural threat to many people’s worldviews, that anti-Semitism causes hostility to Israel, and that hostility to Israel may feed back to increase anti-Semitism.

307,Reactions to Counterstereotypic Behavior: The Role of Backlash in Cultural Stereotype Maintenance,"Social and economic sanctions for counterstereotypical behavior have been termed the backlash effect (L. A. Rudman, 1998). The authors present a model of the role of backlash in cultural stereotype maintenance from the standpoint of both perceivers and actors. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants lost a competition to either atypical or typical men or women and subsequently showed greater tendency to sabotage deviants. Moreover, undermining deviants was associated with increased self-esteem, suggesting that backlash rewards perceivers psychologically. Experiment 3 showed that gender deviants who feared backlash resorted to strategies designed to avoid it (e.g., hiding, deception, and gender conformity). Further, perceivers who sabotaged deviants (Experiment 2) or deviants who hid their atypicality (Experiment 3) estimated greater stereotyping on the part of future perceivers, in support of the model's presumed role for backlash in stereotype maintenance. The implications of the findings for cultural stereotypes are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Rudman, Laurie A. and Fairchild, Kimberly",0,,307
308,From 'we' to 'me': Group identification enhances perceived personal control with consequences for health and well-being,"There is growing recognition that identification with social groups can protect and enhance health and well-being, thereby constituting a kind of 'social cure.' The present research explores the role of control as a novel mediator of the relationship between shared group identity and well-being. Five studies provide evidence for this process. Group identification predicted significantly greater perceived personal control across 47 countries (Study 1), and in groups that had experienced success and failure (Study 2). The relationship was observed longitudinally (Study 3) and experimentally (Study 4). Manipulated group identification also buffered a loss of personal control (Study 5). Across the studies, perceived personal control mediated social cure effects in political, academic, community, and national groups. The findings reveal that the personal benefits of social groups come not only from their ability to make people feel good, but also from their ability to make people feel capable and in control of their lives.

309,Reducing threat responses to help-seeking information: Influences of self-affirmations and reassuring information,"This research was an examination of the effects of two types of self-affirmation interventions in reducing threat responses associated with receiving help-seeking information. Help-seeking information can be threatening to one’s positive self-perceptions and people may avoid seeking such information to protect themselves. There is evidence that reflecting on personal values (values affirmation) may bolster self-integrity and mitigate this avoidance, and it is possible that reflecting on safe, close social relationships (social affirmation) could exhibit similar effects. To experimentally examine this theoretical idea, we applied a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design in the present study on 384 participants and experimentally manipulated their values affirmations (values affirmation vs. no values affirmation) and social affirmations (social affirmation vs. no social affirmation). In addition, because there is no consensus as to the most effective presentation of help-seeking information, the type of help-seeking information presented to potential help-seekers was also manipulated (reassuring help-seeking information vs. nonreassuring help-seeking information). Results indicated that values affirmation and reassuring information were linked to lower threat responses, but social affirmation was not. Values affirmation and reassuring information might be effective strategies for reducing threat responses associated with the presentation of psychological help-seeking information.

310,Hiding in the crowd: Can mortality salience promote affiliation with others who oppose one's worldviews?,"The present research highlights affiliation defenses in the psychological confrontation with death. In 3 experiments, it was found that mortality salience led to increased affiliation strivings, as indicated by a greater preference for sitting within a group as opposed to sitting alone. Mortality salience actually led to increased affiliation with a worldview-threatening group (Experiments 1-2), even when affiliation with the group forced participants to attack their own worldviews (Experiment 3). Taken together, the findings support a distinct role of affiliation defenses against existential concerns. Moreover, affiliation defenses seem powerful enough to override worldview validation defenses, even when the worldviews in question are personally relevant and highly accessible.

311,Existential inquiries and pathological correlates among Indian adolescents,"The recent globalization and liberalization of Indian society has led adolescents to reconsider traditional systems of belief in the light of alternative postmodern world views. Therefore, the purpose of the ex post facto investigation was to examine the relationship between Indian adolescents’ propensity for existential thinking (weak, moderate, strong), type of existential orientation (atheistic, agnostic, theistic), and self-reported symptomatology. A sample (N = 567) of boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 18 years completed three scales: the Existential Thinking Scale, the Existential Orientation Scale, and the Symptom Check List-90-Revised. Results indicate that existential thinking is positively related to symptomatology. This relationship between existential thinking and symptomatology is moderate for atheists, weak for agnostics, and not significant for theists. Existential orientation, on the other hand, is unrelated to psychopathology among those with a weak and moderate propensity for existential thinking, but negatively related to psychopathology among those with a strong propensity for existential thinking. Together, the findings suggest that those with a strong propensity for existential thinking report more symptomatology if atheistic and less symptomatology if theistic.

312,Perceived procedural justice and conflict management in intimate relationships: The moderating effects of anxious attachment and personal power,"Perceived procedural justice ({PPJ}) was recently associated with collaborative conflict management styles among married and cohabiting spouses. In a correlational study of 160 adults, we tested how avoidant and anxious attachment and personal power perceptions moderate the associations between spouse’s {PPJ} and participants’ conflict management styles, because previous research (e.g., in organizations) suggested that personal traits and status-related power moderated responsiveness to procedural justice. In our study, participants who perceived themselves as powerful were less responsive to spouse’s {PPJ}, as was evident by its lower or insignificant correlations with their inclination for collaborative conflict management styles. Anxious attachment also moderated responsiveness to spouse’s {PPJ}, by changing its nature; anxious participants who reported more spouse’s {PPJ} did not reciprocate it; they were more dominating and contrary to their peers, no more compromising.

313,Going along versus going alone: When fundamental motives facilitate strategic (non)conformity,"Three experiments examined how 2 fundamental social motives--self-protection and mate attraction--influenced conformity. A self-protective goal increased conformity for both men and women. In contrast, the effects of a romantic goal depended on sex, causing women to conform more to others' preferences while engendering nonconformity in men. Men motivated to attract a mate were particularly likely to nonconform when (a) nonconformity made them unique (but not merely a member of a small minority) and when (b) the topic was subjective versus objective, meaning that nonconformists could not be revealed to be incorrect. These findings fit with a functional evolutionary model of motivation and behavior, and they indicate that fundamental motives such as self-protection and mate attraction can stimulate specific forms of conformity or nonconformity for strategic self-presentation.

314,Death anxiety and its relationship with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"The studies presented in this article explored the relevance of death fears to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ({OCD}). In Study 1, the relationships between death anxiety and a variety of markers of psychopathology were examined in 171 treatment-seeking participants with {OCD}. Moderate to large correlations between Collett-Lester Fear of Death scale scores, taken at initial assessment, and clinical ratings of {OCD} severity, number of hospitalizations, number of medications, and total number of lifetime anxiety-related diagnoses identified in structured diagnostic interviews were obtained. Study 2 used the mortality salience ({MS}) paradigm to examine whether experimentally manipulated death cognitions exacerbate compulsive cleaning behaviors among {OCD} washers. Treatment-seeking participants with {OCD} (66 washers and 66 nonwashers) were randomly allocated to either a {MS} or dental pain priming condition. Following priming, participants completed a series of distraction tasks involving skin conductance recording, before being offered an opportunity to wash conductive gel off their hands. As hypothesized, washers went to greater efforts in cleaning (as measured by washing duration and soap and paper towel use) than nonwashers. Similarly, participants in the {MS} condition showed greater cleaning than those in the dental pain salience condition. However, these main effects were qualified by significant interactions for both washing duration and soap use. As expected, simple effect contrasts revealed that the effect of {MS} on cleaning behaviors was significant for washers but not for nonwashers.

315,Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor,"The present work suggests that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source. Laboratory tests of self-control (i.e., the Stroop task, thought suppression, emotion regulation, attention control) and of social behaviors (i.e., helping behavior, coping with thoughts of death, stifling prejudice during an interracial interaction) showed that (a) acts of self-control reduced blood glucose levels, (b) low levels of blood glucose after an initial self-control task predicted poor performance on a subsequent self-control task, and (c) initial acts of self-control impaired performance on subsequent self-control tasks, but consuming a glucose drink eliminated these impairments. Self-control requires a certain amount of glucose to operate unimpaired. A single act of self-control causes glucose to drop below optimal levels, thereby impairing subsequent attempts at self-control.

316,How sweet it is to be loved by you: The role of perceived regard in the terror management of close relationships,"Drawing from terror management theory, the present research examined whether people turn to close relationships to manage the awareness of mortality because they serve as a source of perceived regard. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that mortality salience ({MS}) leads people to exaggerate how positively their romantic partners see them and demonstrated that people are more committed to their partners to the extent that their romantic partners serve as a source of perceived regard after {MS} (Study 3). Study 4 revealed that activating thoughts of perceived regard from a partner in response to {MS} reduced death-thought accessibility. Studies 5 and 6 demonstrated that {MS} led high relationship contingent self-esteem individuals to exaggerate perceived regard from a partner, and this heightened regard led to greater commitment to one's partner. Study 7 examined attachment style differences and found that after {MS}, anxious individuals exaggerated how positively their parents see them, whereas secure individuals exaggerated how positively their romantic partners see them. Together, the present results suggest that perceptions of regard play an important role in why people pursue close relationships in the face of existential concerns.

317,Divergent effects of activating thoughts of God on self-regulation,"Despite the cultural ubiquity of ideas and images related to God, relatively little is known about the effects of exposure to God representations on behavior. Specific depictions of God differ across religions, but common to most is that God is (a) an omnipotent, controlling force and (b) an omniscient, all-knowing being. Given these 2 characteristic features, how might exposure to the concept of God influence behavior? Leveraging classic and recent theorizing on self-regulation and social cognition, we predict and test for 2 divergent effects of exposure to notions of God on self-regulatory processes. Specifically, we show that participants reminded of God (vs. neutral or positive concepts) demonstrate both decreased active goal pursuit (Studies 1, 2, and 5) and increased temptation resistance (Studies 3, 4, and 5). These findings provide the first experimental evidence that exposure to God influences goal pursuit and suggest that the ever-present cultural reminders of God can be both burden and benefit for self-regulation.

318,Social psychology and peace: An introductory overview,"This paper begins by giving an overview of why and in which ways social psychological research can be relevant to peace. Galtung's (1969) distinction between negative peace (the absence of direct violence) and positive peace (the absence of structural violence, or the presence of social justice) is crossed with a focus on factors that are detrimental (obstacles) to peace versus factors that are conducive to peace (catalysts), yielding a two-by-two classification of social psychological contributions to peace. Research falling into these four classes is cited in brief, with a particular focus on four exemplary topics: support for military interventions as an obstacle to negative peace; antiwar activism as a catalyst of negative peace; ideologies legitimizing social inequality as an obstacle to positive peace; and commitment to human rights as a catalyst of positive peace. Based on this conceptual framework, the remaining six articles of the special issue 'Social Psychology and Peace' are briefly introduced.

319,Imagining parental sexuality: The experimental study of Freud’s primal scene,"The results of 3 studies are reported designed to test the hypothesis that priming identification with the oedipal 'winner' or 'loser' in the Oedipal situation will unconsciously bias conscious sexual morality in predictable ways. These studies extend research by Hunyady, Josephs, and Jost (2008) that demonstrated that priming oedipal defeat led men to endorse significantly more prohibitive attitudes toward infidelity. Study 1 demonstrated that priming identification with the injured third party in both the primal scene and an adult infidelity scenario significantly decreased male participants’ permissive attitudes toward pornography. Study 2 demonstrated that priming identification with the victim of oedipal betrayal in the primal scene increased the accessibility to consciousness of sexually derogatory words such as 'whore' or 'prick' as assessed through a word completion task. Study 3 demonstrated that priming oedipal victory had the opposite effect of priming oedipal defeat. Priming oedipal victory in the primal scene made attitudes toward infidelity significantly more permissive. In sum, priming oedipal defeat or victory by having participants imagine scenes of parental sexuality unconsciously biases conscious sexual morality in predictable ways in line with Freudian theory of the impact of primal scene observation on the child’s state of mind.

320,Religiosity predicts unreasonable coping with {COVID}-19,"The present study explores the impact of religiosity during the time of the {COVID}-19 pandemic (March 2020). The focus is on associations between religiosity, coronavirus anxiety, and preventive behavior. Participants were 1,182 U.S. citizens (50\% female; 20–83 years of age). Highly religious participants scored higher on the somatic component of coronavirus anxiety (emotionality) but lower on the cognitive component (worry). With regard to preventive behavior, highly religious participants reported more unreasonable behavior (e.g., avoiding 5G networks, hoarding toilet paper) than participants with low religiosity; at the bivariate level, there were no differences in reasonable behavior (e.g., physical contact avoidance, frequent handwashing). A comprehensive mediation model showed emotionality-mediated associations between religiosity and unreasonable behavior (positive indirect effect) but also worry-mediated associations between religiosity and reasonable behavior (negative indirect effect). The results remained stable when controlling for relevant sociodemographic variables. The discussion centers on religiosity, information processing, and rationality during a global health crisis situation.

321,Incidental fear reduces empathy for an out-group’s pain,"Humans generally fear those different to them (i.e., an out-group) in the same way they fear natural predators. But fear pushes us to derogate others, whether they constitute a threat or not. Research has examined how fear associated with specific intergroup relations interferes with how individuals relate to in-group and out-group members. However, we know relatively little about how intergroup relations might be affected by incidental emotions. We tested how incidental fear affects empathy toward in-group and out-group members. We found that exposing participants to fearful imagery was sufficient to reduce empathy, but only in response to out-group suffering.

322,'There but for the grace of God go we': Prejudice toward asylum seekers,"Australia receives relatively few asylum seekers, but the public debate on this issue is intense and there is widespread prejudice toward them. The current research considers the role of two approaches in explaining prejudice toward asylum seekers: similarity priming and affective reactions of empathy. Participants (N = 119) were primed that asylum seekers were either 'similar' to or 'different' from them and were asked whether these similarities or differences were important. Dispositional empathy and asylum-seeker empathy were measured. Results showed that priming was associated with increased prejudice when priming involved similarity and those similarities were held to be important. Moreover, cognitive similarity priming and affective empathy contributed separately and additively to the prediction of prejudice. Qualitative responses to the priming question revealed that even when 'difference' was primed, two of the three prevalent themes were positive. Results are discussed in relation to understanding the cognitive and affective bases of empathy and prejudice, and practical implications for activists working to reduce prejudice toward asylum seekers.

323,Gaining perspective on death: Training program and language use outcomes assessment,"Understanding and managing the fear of death is a central issue in clinical care. Research in terror management theory suggests that death reminders can lead to anxiety, depression, and maladaptive social behaviors. Additional research has suggested that discourse about death can be beneficial in contexts that are safe and supportive. A telecourse and web-based learning program on diverse worldviews of death and the afterlife was developed and used to explore these issues. The impact of this training was assessed using pre- and posttest journaling and questionnaire data. The content of these journals was analyzed within and across subjects for emotionally meaningful expressions related to the writing prompts. Significant pre- and postdifferences were identified using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis software. After the intervention, participants were less centered on their body as use of the body category decreased by 32\% (p {\textless} .01). This was consistent with an increase of 16\% in the use of abstract pronouns (p {\textless} .05). Participants also were more confident in their expression with a 58\% increase in the certain category (p {\textless} .05). Participants made fewer references to death with a decrease of 34\% in the death category (p {\textless} .05). Results of this work support the feasibility of an online training program that has measurable beneficial affects for clinical care, both for professionals and patients. We discuss such educational clinical applications and the implications for future research.

324,Terror management and tolerance: Does mortality salience always intensify negative reactions to others who threaten one's worldview?,"Terror management research has shown that reminding Ss of their mortality leads to intolerance. The present research assessed whether mortality salience would lead to increased intolerance when the value of tolerance is highly accessible. In Study 1, given that liberals value tolerance more than conservatives, it was hypothesized that with mortality salience, dislike of dissimilar others would increase among conseratives but decrease among liberals. Liberal and conservative Ss were induced to think about their own mortality or a neutral topic and then were asked to evaluate 2 target persons, one liberal, the other conservative. Ss' evaluations of the targets supported these hypotheses. In Study 2, the value of tolerance was primed for half the Ss and, under mortality-salient or control conditions, Ss evaluated a target person who criticized the {US}. Mortality salience did not lead to negative reactions to the critic when the value of tolerance was highly accessible.

325,Dynamics of oppression and coping from traumatology perspective: The example of Palestinian adolescents,"Most of our understanding of, and interventions with, trauma are focused on past traumas perpetrated by individuals. Because of this individualistic-based paradigm, most research on oppression adopts an interpersonal violence framework, ignoring the other identity-based variables involved in intergroup trauma. In this study, we test a new paradigm of oppression as perpetration of trauma between groups, including the variables of will to survive and related coping strategies. The new model assumes that collective trauma of oppression brings to the individual’s focus his or her collective identity and triggers identity annihilation and subjugation anxiety that drive mental health distress. On the other hand, will to survive engenders various strategies, which serve to address oppression challenges and to cope with such distress. We tested the model on a sample of 438 Palestinian adolescents (aged 12 to 19 years; 45.4\% females) from the West Bank. We measured life traumas—including oppression, poverty, and will to survive—as independent variables, and identity salience, annihilation anxiety, and coping strategies as mediating variables. We measured posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}), complex {PTSD}, depression, and physical health as outcome variables. Results of path analysis confirmed the general model and indicated that religious coping, political ideology, and social support contributed to reducing mental distress, with religiosity as the strongest predictor, which may explain the electoral success of Islamists in the Palestinian election of 2006 and elections following the Arab Spring. The implications of the results for conflict resolution and in clinical interventions with intergroup trauma victims are discussed.

326,In doubt and disorderly: Ambivalence promotes compensatory perceptions of order,"Ambivalence is a presumably unpleasant experience, and coming to terms with it is an intricate part of human existence. It is argued that ambivalent attitude holders cope with their ambivalence through compensatory perceptions of order. We first show that ambivalence leads to an increase in (visual) perceptions of order (Study 1). In Study 2 we conceptually replicate this finding by showing that ambivalence also increases belief in conspiracy theories, a cognitive form of order perception. Furthermore, this effect is mediated by the negative emotions that are elicited by ambivalence. In Study 3 we show that increased need for order is driving these effects: Affirmations of order cancel out the effect of ambivalence on perceptions of order. Theoretical as well as societal implications are discussed.

327,"Experimental Research on Just-World Theory: Problems, Developments, and Future Challenges","M. J. Lerner (1980) proposed that people need to believe in a just world; thus, evidence that the world is not just is threatening, and people have a number of strategies for reducing such threats. Early research on this idea, and on just-world theory more broadly, was reviewed in early publications (e.g., M. J. Lerner, 1980; M. J. Lerner \& D. T. Miller, 1978). In the present article, focus is directed on the post-1980 experimental research on this theory. First, 2 conceptualizations of the term belief in a just world are described, the typical experimental paradigms are explained, and a general overview of the post-1980 experiments is provided. Second, problems with this literature are discussed, including the unsystematic nature of the research. Third, important developments that have occurred, despite the problems reviewed, are described.

328,Strained interaction: Evidence that interpersonal contact moderates the death?disability rejection link,"Objective: Our objective was to examine whether brief yet significant contact between a confederate seated in a wheelchair and a nondisabled participant may attenuate the relationship between death reminders and disability rejection found in previous research. Method: One hundred two participants were randomly assigned to a mortality salience or control condition and were then seated in a room with a confederate. In half the cases, the confederate sat in a wheelchair, and in the other half in a regular chair. Furthermore, half the participants were assigned to either a collaborative task with the confederate, or to an individual task condition. At the end of the session, participants were asked to evaluate the confederate. Results: Death primes led to a more negative evaluation of the confederate in a wheelchair in the individual task condition. However, this effect was attenuated in the collaborative task condition. Conclusions: The death-disability rejection link is not deterministic and may be attenuated through meaningful contact between people without disabilities and people with physical disabilities ({PWD}). The findings suggest that terror management theory is a particularly useful framework for understanding and intervening in the strained interaction between {PWD} and nondisabled individuals.

329,Fear of death and the judgment of social transgressions: A multidimensional test of terror management theory,"The purpose of the research was to integrate a multidimensional approach to fear of personal death with terror management theory. In Study 1, 190 students were divided according to the manipulation of death salience and the intrapersonal and interpersonal aspects of fear of death and were asked to judge transgressions that have either intrapersonal or interpersonal consequences. Study 2 was a conceptual replication of Study 1, with the exception that the manipulation of mortality salience included conditions that made salient either intrapersonal or interpersonal aspects of death. Findings indicate that the effects of mortality salience depend on the aspect of death that is made salient, the aspect of death that individuals most fear, and the type of the judged transgression. More severe judgments of transgressions after death salience manipulation were found mainly when there was a fit between these 3 factors. Findings are discussed in light of terror management theory.

330,When group membership gets personal: A theory of identity fusion,"Identity fusion is a relatively unexplored form of alignment with groups that entails a visceral feeling of oneness with the group. This feeling is associated with unusually porous, highly permeable borders between the personal and social self. These porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that the personal and social self will combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Furthermore, the strong personal as well as social identities possessed by highly fused persons cause them to recognize other group members not merely as members of the group but also as unique individuals, prompting the development of strong relational as well as collective ties within the group. In local fusion, people develop relational ties to members of relatively small groups (e.g., families or work teams) with whom they have personal relationships. In extended fusion, people project relational ties onto relatively large collectives composed of many individuals with whom they may have no personal relationships. The research literature indicates that measures of fusion are exceptionally strong predictors of extreme pro-group behavior. Moreover, fusion effects are amplified by augmenting individual agency, either directly (by increasing physiological arousal) or indirectly (by activating personal or social identities). The effects of fusion on pro-group actions are mediated by perceptions of arousal and invulnerability. Possible causes of identity fusion—ranging from relatively distal, evolutionary, and cultural influences to more proximal, contextual influences—are discussed. Finally, implications and future directions are considered. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Swann, William B.

331,Remembering Mike Arons (1929–2008): An annotated bibliography,"This article commemorates the life and works of Dr. Myron Milford 'Mike' Arons (1929–2008), recognized internationally as one of the founders of humanistic psychology. Although Arons contributed exhaustively to humanistic psychology and he presented extensively during his career, on the whole he published relatively little—and sometimes in publications of limited circulation. This article presents an annotated bibliography of as complete a collection of his writings as possible as both a tribute to his memory and a gateway to reflection and scholarship by future generations of humanistic psychologists who did not have the privilege to know Arons.

332,Maintaining an even keel: An affect-mediated model of mindfulness and hostile work behavior,"Mindfulness, defined in terms of greater attention to and awareness of the present moment, may benefit equanimity both outside and inside the workplace. Two studies (total N = 224) of part-time employees supported this idea. Employees who were higher in dispositional mindfulness were less Machiavellian (Study 1), and they engaged in fewer counterproductive work behaviors ({CWBs}; Study 2). Furthermore, and consistent with an emotion-related theory of mindfulness, these inverse relationships were mediated by hostile feelings such as irritation and anger. That is, mindful people were less hostile in their behaviors in part because they were less prone to hostile feelings. The results suggest that mindfulness may be an efficacious state in reducing hostile feelings and behaviors at work. More generally, they contribute to an emotion-related perspective of mindfulness and some of its behavioral consequences.

333,Compensatory conviction in the face of personal uncertainty: Going to extremes and being oneself,"Study 1 participants' self-integrity (C. M. Steele, 1988) was threatened by deliberative mind-set (S. E. Taylor \& P. M. Gollwitzer, 1995) induced uncertainty. They masked the uncertainty with more extreme conviction about social issues. An integrity-repair exercise after the threat, however, eliminated uncertainty and the conviction response. In Study 2, the same threat caused clarified values and more self-consistent personal goals. Two other uncertainty-related threats, mortality salience and temporal discontinuity, caused similar responses: more extreme intergroup bias in Study 3, and more self consistent personal goals and identifications in Study 4. Going to extremes and being oneself are seen as 2 modes of compensatory conviction used to defend against personal uncertainty. Relevance to cognitive dissonance and authoritarianism theories is discussed, and a new perspective on terror management theory (J. Greenberg, S. Solomom, \& T. Pyszczynski, 1997) is proposed.

334,Tapping the humanistic potential of self-determination theory: Awakening to paradox,"Self-determination theory ({SDT}) is a contemporary macrotheory of motivation, personality, and wellness that has accumulated a large empirical research base. Many of its basic principles are humanistic in character, but there is little literature on it from within the ranks of humanistic psychology. This article presents an overview of the theory designed specifically for a humanistic audience and considers {SDT}’s potential as a contemporary variant of humanistic psychology. {SDT}’s core concept of autonomy is compared with the humanistic notion of willing, which formally introduces paradox as a fundamental aspect of self-development. Paradox is then pursued as a theme that can be used to tap the humanistic potential of {SDT}. Subsequent analyses focus on various integrative strengths or virtues derived from Knowles’s (1986) existential-phenomenological interpretation of Eriksonian (1963) developmental theory, certain optimal forms of experience, happiness, and well-being. We conclude with some exploratory remarks concerning motivation, personality, and the paradoxical bipolarity of human nature.

335,Dissonance and discomfort: Does a simple cognitive inconsistency evoke a negative affective state?,"Festinger (1957) described cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort that resulted from a cognitive inconsistency. Discussion of dissonance for the past 60 years has focused on the classic paradigms and the motivation to reduce dissonance, but some have noted that this represents a narrow application of Festinger’s ideas (Gawronski \& Brannon, in press). Recent research has suggested, but not demonstrated, that simple cognitive inconsistencies may also evoke the affective and motivational state of dissonance (e.g., E. Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones, \& Levy, 2015). In the current experiments, participants read sentences that ended with incongruent or congruent final words. In Study 1, sentences with incongruent endings led to more negative implicit affect than did sentences with congruent endings. Study 2 replicated this finding, with the addition of self-report and facial electromyography. These findings indicate that simple inconsistencies can evoke dissonance.

336,Childhood maltreatment and context dependent empathic accuracy in adult romantic relationships,"Objectives: Childhood maltreatment, that is neglect and abuse, are associated with difficulties in adult relationship functioning. We tested whether childhood maltreatment changes the presence of a relationship protective mechanism, called motivated inaccuracy. It describes a decrease in romantic couples’ empathic accuracy, ({EA}), that is, their correct understanding of the partners’ thoughts and feelings, in situations that pose a potential threat to the stability of the relationship. With this, couples seem to protect their relationship stability from their partners’ potentially destabilizing mental contents. Method: Romantic couples were videotaped while discussing (a) their favorite film-genre (neutral/positive), (b) their most relevant fear of the past year (personally threatening), and (c) a reason that might lead to a break-up in their relationship (relationship-threatening). {EA} was measured by the overlap between participants’ judgments of their partners’ feelings and the partners’ self-rated actual feeling, using a continuous video rating of the interactions. Childhood neglect and abuse were retrospectively assessed by a questionnaire. Results: Overall, participants decreased their {EA} for each other in the relationship-threatening versus personally threatening conversation, replicating motivated inaccuracy. However, when individuals with high levels of reported childhood neglect felt threatened by the relationship-threatening condition, they did not show this relationship protective mechanism, that is, they showed maintained {EA} scores. Abuse in childhood did not influence the presence of motivated inaccuracy. Conclusions: Childhood neglect might influence adult romantic relationship functioning by leading to a lack of motivated inaccuracy during relationship-threatening situations. An altered threat coping strategy might cause the inability to protect oneself from relationship-threatening information.

337,Dying to watch: Thoughts of death and preferences for sexual media content,"Research has shown that thoughts about death influence sexual cognitions and some media choices. The present study tested the hypothesis that thoughts about death may affect individuals’ tendency to select or avoid entertainment media programming containing sexual material. In two experiments, thoughts about death (mortality salience [{MS}]) were manipulated before college undergraduates expressed interest in viewing television shows and movies with varying amounts of sexual content. In both studies, {MS} was associated with greater overall interest in sexual media content. Although terror management theory would indicate that sexual worldview should moderate this effect, this was not observed to be the case. In addition, {MS} was not found to affect interest in other types of highly engaging media content including violent and dramatic content. Limitations regarding generalizability are discussed. Results suggest that {MS} increases a preference for sexual media content, and that this occurs for individuals with diverse sexual values systems. This is discussed in terms of implications for terror management theory and cognitive models of media influence.

338,Spirituality as a moderator of mortality salience effects and authoritarian attitudes,"Like animals, humans share the instinct for self-preservation; yet unlike other species, humans are aware that death is inevitable. Terror management theory ({TMT}) hypothesizes that human beings use cultural symbols and practices in an attempt to transcend individual mortality. Individuals construct their cultural worldview as a way to avoid the fear-related anxiety provoked by the knowledge of the inescapability of death. From this perspective, according to {TMT}, when individuals' cultural worldviews are threatened in the face of reminders of mortality, they often tend to respond in an authoritarian manner toward those who do not share these worldviews. Spirituality beliefs represent just one set of cultural constructs that may address anxiety regarding mortality. The current study aimed to examine whether spirituality (e.g., support and openness) moderates the relationship between mortality salience and authoritarian attitudes. Ninety-six participants were drawn from a large public university in the northeastern United States. {PROCESS} analysis was used to assess whether for spirituality (support and openness), moderated the relationship between mortality salience (vs. pain) and authoritarian attitudes. Results indicated that spirituality did not moderate the association between the predictor and criterion variables.

339,How defendants’ legal status and ethnicity and participants’ political orientation relate to death penalty sentencing decisions,"Increases in U.S. immigration and the growth in the Latino population highlight the importance of understanding the influence of ethnicity and legal status on participants’ decision-making. Furthermore, immigration is a politically charged topic, which suggests participants’ political orientation might relate to their decisions in cases involving immigrant defendants. Using the justification-suppression model of prejudice, this study investigated the influence of a defendant’s ethnicity and legal status in the context of a death penalty trial. Results demonstrate that the defendant’s ethnicity did not influence participants’ punishment decisions, but legal status did. Specifically, participants were generally more punitive toward both undocumented and documented immigrant defendants, compared to U.S.-born defendants. Punitiveness toward documented immigrants was qualified by an interaction with participants’ political orientation, such that middle-of-the-road and more liberal participants reported greater punitiveness toward a documented immigrant defendant, compared to a U.S.-born defendant, but more conservative participants reported no differences in punitiveness between documented immigrant defendants and U.S.-born defendants. This effect was mediated by participants’ evaluation of mitigators and aggravators but only among more liberal and middle-of-the-road participants. Implications for policy and future directions are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Alvarez, Mauricio J. and Miller, Monica K.",0,,339
340,An appraisal profile of nostalgia,"The authors aimed to (a) identify the cognitive appraisals underlying nostalgia and (b) compare nostalgia with other emotions in terms of its appraisal profile. In Study 1, participants (N = 1,125) generated narratives. Next, they reported the level of nostalgia and 31 other emotions that these narratives elicited. Subsequently, participants evaluated the narrative events on several cognitive appraisals. Events that elicited nostalgia were pleasant, involved an irretrievable loss, felt psychologically distant, and were unique—an appraisal profile that differed from all other emotions. In Study 2 (N = 1,261), the authors experimentally varied these appraisals in a vignette paradigm and measured anticipated nostalgia and 10 other emotions. Participants anticipated most nostalgia when events were pleasant, involved irretrievable loss, were distant, and were unique—a profile shared only with longing. In Study 3 (N = 994), the authors used a guided autobiographical recall procedure in which they manipulated appraisals and measured the resultant emotions. Corroborating Studies 1–2, nostalgia was most intense for events that were pleasant, irretrievably lost, temporally distant, and unique. This appraisal profile was not shared by other emotions. The findings delineate the distinguishing cognitive appraisal profile of nostalgia. Nostalgia occupies a special place in the pantheon of emotions.

341,"Justice at the millennium, a decade later: A meta-analytic test of social exchange and affect-based perspectives","Although a flurry of meta-analyses summarized the justice literature at the turn of the millennium, interest in the topic has surged in the decade since. In particular, the past decade has witnessed the rise of social exchange theory as the dominant lens for examining reactions to justice, and the emergence of affect as a complementary lens for understanding such reactions. The purpose of this meta-analytic review was to test direct, mediating, and moderating hypotheses that were inspired by those 2 perspectives, to gauge their adequacy as theoretical guides for justice research. Drawing on a review of 493 independent samples, our findings revealed a number of insights that were not included in prior meta-analyses. With respect to social exchange theory, our results revealed that the significant relationships between justice and both task performance and citizenship behavior were mediated by indicators of social exchange quality (trust, organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, and leader–member exchange), though such mediation was not apparent for counterproductive behavior. The strength of those relationships did not vary according to whether the focus of the justice matched the target of the performance behavior, contrary to popular assumptions in the literature, or according to whether justice was referenced to a specific event or a more general entity. With respect to affect, our results showed that justice–performance relationships were mediated by positive and negative affect, with the relevant affect dimension varying across justice and performance variables. Our discussion of these findings focuses on the merit in integrating the social exchange and affect lenses in future research.

342,"The effects of values, expectations, and mortality reminders on individuals' choices between alternatives","In ordinary, everyday situations, we often 'weigh our options' before making decisions Using this rational thought process, we often choose the option that is most feasible and aligned with our values During severe weather and natural disasters, the fear we experience as a result of the life-threatening conditions at-hand often change the way our values influence our reactions This dissertation integrates expectancy-value and terror management theories to examine how values, valences, and expectations impact individuals' choices when they are responding to ordinary situations, and how these relations change when responding to hypothetical potentially deadly natural hazards. Participants were undergraduates enrolled at two {HBCUs} Pilot studies assessed the extent to which thinking about potentially deadly natural hazard threats increased death-thought accessibility, and generated relevant outcome expectations and barriers to action for the scenarios In the primary studies, participants completed questionnaires and a mortality salience manipulation prior to reading three vignettes about either ordinary, student-relevant situations (e.g., studying for an exam; Study 1) or hypothetical natural hazard situations (e.g., an incoming hurricane; Studies 2 and 3) Each scenario was presented with two courses of action, and the dependent measures: valence ratings, self-efficacy expectations, outcome expectations, barriers to action (weather scenarios only), and a choice measure. Content analysis, {ANOVAs}, correlations, and logistic regressions were used to analyze the data Pilot data revealed thinking about natural hazard threats did not increase death-thought accessibility, as expected, but did increase threat perceptions and death-related thoughts Study 1 showed a combination of values, valences, and expectations significantly influenced participants' choices in ordinary scenarios. Study 2 showed these same factors were less important to self-protective decisions Instead, barriers to action, valences, and only a few expectations and values predicted choices in the natural hazard scenarios Study 3 replicated these findings among a different sample of participants The findings across these studies suggested participants engaged in a more rational decision-making process during everyday situations, but made self-protective decisions during natural hazard threats using a very different thought process.

Within this cultural context, utilizing national pride as a coping strategy for dealing with {MS} may require well-developed self-regulatory abilities: It was hypothesized that the typical increment in national pride after induced {MS} would be confined to action-oriented individuals, who are able to self-regulate after exposure to threatening information. Two studies with German participants showed that they negatively evaluated national pride. Consistent with expectations, action-oriented participants in the {MS} condition revalued this symbol and also gave higher attractiveness ratings to attributes related to their own culture. Results remained unchanged after controlling for participants' self-esteem. The combined role of self-regulation and culture in terror management is discussed.

344,Caregivers’ burden and depressive symptoms: The moderational role of attachment orientations,"Objective: The current study explored whether attachment orientations moderate the associations between caregiver burden and depressive symptoms among women coping with their partners’ first time acute coronary syndrome. The association between burden and depression was hypothesized to be stronger among caregivers high on anxious attachment than among caregivers low on this dimension. In addition, the association between burden and depressive symptoms was hypothesized to be weaker among caregivers higher on avoidant attachment than among those lower on this dimension. Method: The sample consisted of 111 female caregivers of male patients admitted to the cardiac care unit of a hospital in Israel. Caregivers completed a measure of attachment orientations during patients’ hospitalization (baseline). Caregiver burden was measured 1 month later. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and again at 6-month follow-up. Structural equation modeling was used to test the moderational models. Results: The association between caregiver burden and depressive symptoms at follow-up was moderated by attachment-related anxiety but not attachment-related avoidance. Congruent with predictions, a stronger association between caregiver burden and depressive symptoms occurred for caregivers with greater (vs. lower) attachment anxiety. Conclusions: The findings shed light on the possible dynamics among attachment orientations and affect regulation when coping with one’s partner’s illness. The findings are discussed in light of Pietromonaco, Uchino, and Dunkel Schetter’s (2013) model of integrating attachment into health psychology research.

345,Nostalgia: The bittersweet history of a psychological concept,"The concept of nostalgia has changed substantially both denotatively and connotatively over the span of its 300-year history. This article traces the evolution of the concept from its origins as a medical disease to its contemporary understanding as a psychological construct. The difficulty of tracing a construct through history is highlighted. Attention is paid to roles played first by the medical context, and then by the psychiatric, psychoanalytic, and psychological approaches. Emphasis is given to shifts in the designation of nostalgic valence from bitter to sweet to bittersweet, and the processes of semantic drift and depathologization are explored. Because the sense of nostalgia was constructed and reconstructed within social, cultural, and historical contexts, its meaning changed along with the words used to describe and connect it to other entities. Nostalgia’s past illustrates the influence of language, social-cultural context, and discipline perspectives on how a construct is defined, researched, and applied.

However, little is known about the social psychological dynamics of this collective emotion across cultures. We predicted that collective nostalgia is triggered by collective angst as it helps people to restore a sense of in-group continuity via stronger in-group belonging and out-group rejection (in the form of opposition to immigrants). Based on a sample (N = 5,956) of individuals across 27 countries, the general pattern of results revealed that collective angst predicts collective nostalgia, which subsequently relates to stronger feelings of in-group continuity via in-group belonging (but not via out-group rejection).

347,Powerful people feel less fear of negative evaluation: The mediating role of personal control belief,"To directly examine why an individual’s capacity to influence others by providing valued resources (i.e., power) could decrease the concerns about negative evaluation from others (i.e., the fear of negative evaluation, {FNE}) in daily life, two studies were conducted. Results found that perceived power (Study 1) was associated with lower {FNE}, and manipulating power levels (Study 2) caused less {FNE}. Furthermore, results indicate that personal control belief mediated this link. These findings provide empirical evidence of the underlying mechanism of the effect of power on reducing {FNE}. The current research contributes significantly because it sheds light on how power transferred from a person’s 'external world' to their 'internal world' (i.e., personal control belief) can influence their cognition and behavior.

348,Did our ancestors fear the unknown? The role of predation in the survival advantage,"Recent findings from the memory literature indicate that the human memory system may prioritize survival-relevant information, relative to other types of information. The original work led by Nairne and colleagues (Nairne, Pandeirada, \& Thompson, 2008; Nairne, Thompson, \& Pandeirada, 2007) suggested that survival processing may be a more efficient mnemonic strategy than more well-known strategies (e.g., generation, pleasantness ratings). This conjecture hypothesizes that memory performance today can provide us with the insight needed to predict what our memory system was evolved to prioritize for later retrieval. The current study was designed to investigate one component of the survival advantage: the fear of predation in survival settings. After modifying the survival passage, we found that a supernatural predator (a demon) motivated the highest amount of word recall, relative to pleasantness ratings, though word recall was not significantly greater than the standard predator passage. On the other hand, a bizarre version of the passage, with a clown predator, did not lead to any survival advantage. These results are discussed with regard to both modern and ancestral fears.

349,The cycle of intergroup conflict: Terror management in the face of terrorism and war - Handbook of terror management theory.,"This chapter discusses findings from years of terror management research on the effects of mortality salience and how proximal and distal defenses in response to it have consequences for the development of conflict in social interactions. It presents an interaction cycle that involves the perception of threatening situations that engage motivational-affective states, motivated cognition, and motivated behavior that might explain the escalation of interpersonal and intergroup conflict. The chapter focuses mainly on the context of armed conflicts, terrorism angst, and the refugee situation in Central Europe. It accumulates evidence for mortality salience and terrorism threat effects on the different stages of the proposed model; furthermore, the chapter proposes interventions and points at which it sees the possibility of breaking the cycle of conflict. In situations of threat, defenses can be redirected to reduce antisocial and hostile outcomes. When prosocial norms on a personal and social level are salient, people can project general injunctive norms by promoting peaceful behavior as a moral norm as well as descriptive norms by acting in a prosocial way—allowing all to peacefully coexist.

350,Culture and the distinctiveness motive: Constructing identity in individualistic and collectivistic contexts,"The motive to attain a distinctive identity is sometimes thought to be stronger in, or even specific to, those socialized into individualistic cultures. Using data from 4,751 participants in 21 cultural groups (18 nations and 3 regions), we tested this prediction against our alternative view that culture would moderate the ways in which people achieve feelings of distinctiveness, rather than influence the strength of their motivation to do so. We measured the distinctiveness motive using an indirect technique to avoid cultural response biases. Analyses showed that the distinctiveness motive was not weaker—and, if anything, was stronger—in more collectivistic nations. However, individualism–collectivism was found to moderate the ways in which feelings of distinctiveness were constructed: Distinctiveness was associated more closely with difference and separateness in more individualistic cultures and was associated more closely with social position in more collectivistic cultures. Multilevel analysis confirmed that it is the prevailing beliefs and values in an individual's context, rather than the individual's own beliefs and values, that account for these differences.

351,Things rank and gross in nature: A review and synthesis of moral disgust,"Much like unpalatable foods, filthy restrooms, and bloody wounds, moral transgressions are often described as 'disgusting.' This linguistic similarity suggests that there is a link between moral disgust and more rudimentary forms of disgust associated with toxicity and disease. Critics have argued, however, that such references are purely metaphorical, or that moral disgust may be limited to transgressions that remind us of more basic disgust stimuli. Here we review the evidence that moral transgressions do genuinely evoke disgust, even when they do not reference physical disgust stimuli such as unusual sexual behaviors or the violation of purity norms. Moral transgressions presented verbally or visually and those presented as social transactions reliably elicit disgust, as assessed by implicit measures, explicit self-report, and facial behavior. Evoking physical disgust experimentally renders moral judgments more severe, and physical cleansing renders them more permissive or more stringent, depending on the object of the cleansing. Last, individual differences in the tendency to experience disgust toward physical stimuli are associated with variation in moral judgments and morally relevant sociopolitical attitudes. Taken together, these findings converge to support the conclusion that moral transgressions can in fact elicit disgust, suggesting that moral cognition may draw upon a primitive rejection response. We highlight a number of outstanding issues and conclude by describing 3 models of moral disgust, each of which aims to provide an account of the relationship between moral and physical disgust.

352,Linguistic description moderates the evaluations of counterstereotypical people,"The present research investigated linguistic description as a moderator of biased evaluations of counterstereotypical individuals. Members of an online participant pool (N = 237) indicated their liking for stereotypical and counterstereotypical individuals who were described using adjectives or behaviors. There was a significant interaction between target typicality and linguistic description: People liked counterstereotypical individuals more than stereotypical individuals when target individuals were described using adjectives. In contrast, they showed no bias or a negative bias against counterstereotypical individuals who were described using behaviors. This interaction effect generalized across gender targets (men/women) and sexuality targets (gay/straight), and it was partially mediated by subjective processing fluency. Implications for the backlash effect and prejudice reduction are discussed.

353,If my masculinity is threatened I won’t support gender equality? The role of agentic self-stereotyping in restoration of manhood and perception of gender relations,"Threats to masculinity can trigger compensatory mechanisms such as risk-taking, aggression, or disparagement of gender atypical others. In Study 1 (N = 76) we tested whether threat to men’s agentic self (information about the level of testosterone) influences men’s (a) attitudes toward parental duties, and (b) their support for gender equality. Polish men (but not women) whose gender identity was threatened manifested more traditional attitudes toward parental duties, were more willing to endorse stereotypical gender roles, and showed less support for gender equality and less willingness to support collective egalitarian actions. In Study 2 (N = 313) we found that agency is related to gender system justification in men, suggesting a potential mediator of the effects related to compensatory mechanisms evoked by a gender identity threat among men. This was confirmed in Study 3 (N = 131), where participants read a short scientific text either (a) emphasizing the existence of stereotypical gender differences in terms of agency and communality, or (b) claiming that there are no such differences. Results indicated that in the 'no differences' condition, men (but not women) showed lower acceptance of gender inequality and a greater willingness to engage in domestic activities. This effect was mediated by participants’ self-perceived agency.

354,Going to College and Unpacking Hazing: A Functional Approach to Decrypting Initiation Practices Among Undergraduates,"Initiation practices likely support group functioning by promoting group-relevant skills and attitudes, reinforcing status hierarchies, and stimulating cognitive, behavioral, and affective forms of social dependency. In field tests of these propositions, 269 undergraduates from same-gender organizations rated their initiation experiences. As predicted, athletes reported relatively more physical challenge and pain, whereas members of Greek-letter organizations reported more social deviance and embarrassment. Hierarchy was positively associated with initiations featuring social deviance but unexpectedly negatively related to physically and psychologically harsh initiations. Harsh treatment and fun independently predicted group identity. Laboratory experiments on male (n = 74) and female (n = 37) undergraduates found that discomforting inductions increased social dependence on group opinion and, for women, increased additional forms of dependence (proximity to induction agents and negative mood when left alone). The results across studies suggested that hazing's task masters are 3: schooling skills and attitudes, conveying hierarchy, and promoting social dependency.

355,Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?,"It is assumed that people seek positive self-regard; that is, they are motivated to possess, enhance, and maintain positive self-views. The cross-cultural generalizability of such motivations was addressed by examining Japanese culture. Anthropological, sociological, and psychological analyses revealed that many elements of Japanese culture are incongruent with such motivations. Moreover, the empirical literature provides scant evidence for a need for positive self-regard among Japanese and indicates that a self-critical focus is more characteristic of Japanese. It is argued that the need for self-regard must be culturally variant because the constructions of self and regard themselves differ across cultures. The need for positive self-regard, as it is currently conceptualized, is not a universal, but rather is rooted in significant aspects of North American culture. Conventional interpretations of positive self-regard are too narrow to encompass the Japanese experience.

356,The intuitive greater good: Testing the corrective dual process model of moral cognition,"Building on the old adage that the deliberate mind corrects the emotional heart, the influential dual process model of moral cognition has posited that utilitarian responding to moral dilemmas (i.e., choosing the greater good) requires deliberate correction of an intuitive deontological response. In the present article, we present 4 studies that force us to revise this longstanding 'corrective' dual process assumption. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants had to give their first, initial response to moral dilemmas under time-pressure and cognitive load. Next, participants could take all the time they wanted to reflect on the problem and give a final response. This allowed us to identify the intuitively generated response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Results consistently show that in the vast majority of cases (+ 70\%) in which people opt for a utilitarian response after deliberation, the utilitarian response is already given in the initial phase. Hence, utilitarian responders do not need to deliberate to correct an initial deontological response. Their intuitive response is already utilitarian in nature. We show how this leads to a revised model in which moral judgments depend on the absolute and relative strength differences between competing deontological and utilitarian intuitions.

In Studies 2 through 4, a mortality salience induction (e.g., walking through a cemetery) increased self-reported and actual helping behavior only when the cultural value of helping was salient. These results suggest that people may adhere to norms and values so as to manage awareness of death.

We propose several 'wise additions,' based upon the principles outlined by Walton (2014), intended to bridge current social psychological research with clinical psychological therapeutic practice using cognitive-behavioral therapy as an example. We consider how recent advances in social psychological theories can inform the development and implementation of wise additions in clinical case conceptualization and interventions.

359,Atimia: A novel group-based paradigm for manipulating ostracism and group members’ performance,"Ostracism, being excluded and ignored, is a socially painful experience that can lead to distressing consequences, including thwarted basic needs satisfaction and worsened mood (Williams \& Nida, 2011). Ostracism researchers have relied heavily on a single paradigm: Cyberball (Williams, Cheung, \& Choi, 2000), and although Cyberball has been conducted successfully with over 5,000 participants, there are few alternative paradigms to replicate ostracism’s effects. Specifically, no alternative paradigms utilize a group-based interaction in which players continuously interact to achieve a goal. Additionally, researchers have not incorporated a key characteristic of the group that influences satisfaction: the efficacy of a group to accomplish a task (i.e., burdensomeness). To address these issues, we designed Atimia, a group-based game in which players take turns completing word-association items. We manipulated computer-controlled agents to either ostracize or include participants and to be burdensome (i.e., perform poorly) or nonburdensome. We found participants felt worse when they were ostracized, compared with when they were included, and when playing with a burdensome versus nonburdensome group. Ostracism effect sizes were comparable with Cyberball and other alternative ostracism paradigms. Similar to previous ostracism research, a group characteristic (burdensomeness) did not buffer the effects of ostracism. Examining beyond the immediate ostracism effects, participants were more interested in continuing with a nonburdensome group that included them compared with a burdensome, but inclusive, group or a group that ostracized (regardless of group burdensomeness). Initial results suggest Atimia is a means to replicate ostracism’s effects and is a new tool for researchers studying groups.

360,"Hierarchy, leadership, and construal fit","Three studies tested the hypothesis, derived from construal-level theory, that hierarchical distance between leaders and followers moderates the effectiveness of leader behaviors such that abstract behaviors produce more positive outcomes when enacted across large hierarchical distances, whereas concrete behaviors produce more positive outcomes when enacted across small hierarchical distances. In Study 1 (N = 2,206 employees of a telecommunication organization), job satisfaction was higher when direct supervisors provided employees with concrete feedback and hierarchically distant leaders shared with them their abstract vision rather than vice versa. Study 2 orthogonally crossed hierarchical distances with communication type, operationalized as articulating abstract values versus sharing a detailed story exemplifying the same values; construal misfit mediated the interactive effects of hierarchical distance and communication type on organizational commitment and social bonding. Study 3 similarly manipulated hierarchical distances and communication type, operationalized as concrete versus abstract calls for action in the context of a severe professional crisis. Group commitment and participation in collective action were higher when a hierarchically proximate leader communicated a concrete call for action and a hierarchically distant leader communicated an abstract call for action rather than vice versa. These findings highlight construal fit’s positive consequences for individuals and organizations.

361,The scientific legacy of Sigmund Freud: Toward a psychodynamically informed psychological science,"Although commentators periodically declare that Freud is dead, his repeated burials lie on shaky grounds. Critics typically attack an archaic version of psychodynamic theory that most clinicians similarly consider obsolete. Central to contemporary psychodynamic theory is a series of propositions about (a) unconscious cognitive, affective, and motivational processes; (b) ambivalence and the tendency for affective and motivational dynamics to operate in parallel and produce compromise solutions; (c) the origins of many personality and social dispositions in childhood; (d) mental representations of the self, others, and relationships; and (e) developmental dynamics. An enormous body of research in cognitive, social, developmental, and personality psychology now supports many of these propositions. Freud's scientific legacy has implications for a wide range of domains in psychology, such as integration of affective and motivational constraints into connectionist models in cognitive science.

362,Firing Back at the Backfire Effect: The Influence of Mortality Salience and Nullification Beliefs on Reactions to Inadmissible Evidence,"Two studies were conducted to explore psychological factors that contribute to the influence of inadmissible evidence (i.e., the backfire effect) on jurors' verdicts. On the basis of hypotheses derived from terror management theory, we predicted that reminders of mortality, in contrast to an aversive control topic, should lead participants to be less punitive when confronted with inadmissible (as opposed to admissible) evidence, when participants were either situationally induced or dispositionally prone to follow their personal sense of justice. In Study 1, control participants who scored high on a measure of nullification beliefs, and thus were prone to relying on their own sense of justice rather than the law, exhibited the backfire effect. However, reminding participants of their mortality reduced the damaging influence of inadmissible evidence. Study 2 extended these findings by showing parallel effects with a manipulation of nullification proneness via judicial instructions. The implications of these factors on the judicial process are discussed.

363,Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information,"A meta-analysis assessed whether exposure to information is guided by defense or accuracy motives. The studies examined information preferences in relation to attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in situations that provided choices between congenial information, which supported participants’ pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, and uncongenial information, which challenged these tendencies. Analyses indicated a moderate preference for congenial over uncongenial information (d = 0.36). As predicted, this congeniality bias was moderated by variables that affect the strength of participants’ defense motivation and accuracy motivation. In support of the importance of defense motivation, the congeniality bias was weaker when participants’ attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were supported prior to information selection; when participants’ attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were not relevant to their values or not held with conviction; when the available information was low in quality; when participants’ closed-mindedness was low; and when their confidence in the attitude, belief, or behavior was high. In support of the importance of accuracy motivation, an uncongeniality bias emerged when uncongenial information was relevant to accomplishing a current goal.

364,Ethnic group moderates the association between attachment and well-being in later life,"Attachment styles are associated with well-being across the life span. Particularly in later life, when individuals face declining health and increasing dependency, patterns of attachment may relate to affective outcomes. However, few studies have empirically examined the attachment–well-being link at the end of the life span or considered whether ethnic group membership may moderate attachment–well-being links. Data from a sample of older adults (N = 1,116) were used to investigate how secure, dismissive, and fearful/avoidant styles predicted well-being in 4 ethnic groups; African Americans, European Americans, Eastern European immigrants, and English-speaking Caribbean immigrants. As expected, both secure and dismissive attachment dimensions were related to greater well-being, whereas fearful/avoidant attachment was associated with less. This positive impact of a secure attachment style of relating to others on well-being was stronger among African Americans and English-speaking Caribbeans compared with the European American and Eastern European immigrant groups. The negative impact of a fearful/avoidant attachment style of relating on well-being was buffered by being an English-speaking Caribbean but not for the other 3 groups. Results are interpreted in light of general and culture-specific premises of attachment. The article concludes with some implications and suggestions for future work.

367,Emotion differentiation moderates aggressive tendencies in angry people: A daily diary analysis,"Anger is commonly associated with aggression. Inefficient anger-coping strategies increase negative affect and deplete the regulatory resources needed to control aggressive impulses. Factors linked with better emotion regulation may then weaken the relationship between anger and aggression. The current work explored one factor associated with emotion regulation—differentiating one's emotions into discrete categories—that may buffer angry people from aggression. Three diary studies (N = 628) tested the hypothesis that emotion differentiation would weaken the relationship between anger and aggression. In Study 1, participants high in emotion differentiation reported less daily aggressive tendencies when angry, compared to low differentiators. In Study 2, compared to low differentiators, high differentiators reported less frequent provocation in daily life and less daily aggression in response to being provoked and feeling intense anger. Study 3 showed that high daily emotional control mediated the interactive effect of emotion differentiation and anger on aggression. These results highlight the importance of considering how angry people differentiate their emotions in predicting their aggressive responses to anger.

368,Greater empathic accuracy and emotional reactivity in old age: The sample case of death and dying,"With increasing age, proximity to one’s own death increases and topics related to death and dying may become particularly relevant and familiar. Consequently, older, as compared to young, adults should experience stronger negative emotions in response to these topics and show higher empathy for other individuals dealing with them. To address these predictions, in a first study, we presented two types of death-related stimuli to 41 young and 41 older adults (i.e., participants were asked to write about how they think and feel about their own death and they were presented with three newly developed films of adults talking about various death-related aspects). Although age differences in emotional reactions to the writing task were nonsignificant, in comparison to young adults, older adults reacted to the film stimuli with stronger negative emotions, especially with greater anxiety and sadness. At the same time, older adults reported greater sympathy for the film protagonists and were better able to recognize their emotions accurately. In a second study, we provided further evidence for the idea that the age relevance and familiarity of stimuli determine older adults’ emotional reactions by varying the age-relevance of two film stimuli. As predicted, and consistent with Study 1, older adults reacted with greater anxiety and sadness to the death-related film, but not to a film about divorce, that was not particularly relevant to older adults. Taken together, our studies provide evidence for the idea that particularly older adults’ emotional reactions are influenced by the context of an emotional situation.

369,Not quite human: Infrahumanization in response to collective responsibility for intergroup killing,"The present research examines how awareness of violence perpetrated against an out-group by one's in-group can intensify the infrahumanization of the out-group, as measured by a reduced tendency to accord uniquely human emotions to out-groups. Across 3 experiments that used different in-groups (humans, British, White Americans) and out-groups (aliens, Australian Aborigines, and Native Americans), when participants were made aware of the in-group's mass killing of the out-group, they infrahumanized the victims more. The perception of collective responsibility, not just the knowledge that the out-group members had died in great numbers, was shown to be necessary for this effect. Infrahumanization also occurred concurrently with increased collective guilt but was unrelated to it. It is proposed that infrahumanization may be a strategy for people to reestablish psychological equanimity when confronted with a self-threatening situation and that such a strategy may occur concomitantly with other strategies, such as providing reparations to the out-group.

Despite this and despite the well-known growth of the older population, age-based prejudice remains an understudied topic in social psychology. This article systematically reviews the literature on ageism, highlighting extant research on its consequences and theoretical perspectives on its causes. We then identify a crucial gap in the literature, potential intergenerational tensions, speculating how a growing-older population—and society's efforts to accommodate it—might stoke intergenerational fires, particularly among the younger generation. Presenting both sides of this incipient issue, we review relevant empirical work that introduces reasons for both optimism and pessimism concerning intergenerational relations within an aging society. We conclude by suggesting future avenues for ageism research, emphasizing the importance of understanding forthcoming intergenerational dynamics for the benefit of the field and broader society.

However, the content of religious belief systems varies considerably.

The present research extends previous work by (a) examining whether defensive religion serves as a source of meaning in life, and (b) identifying mediators of that relationship. We propose a dual mediation model of the meaning-serving function of defensive religiousness. Path analysis revealed that defensive religion was related to meaning in life, and this relationship was mediated by belief in literal immortality and religious commitment. These results suggest that defensive religious beliefs are a source of meaning in life.

374,Family functioning among returnees to Orthodox Judaism in Israel,"The role of religious conversion in marriages and family functioning has been little explored. The current study examined family functioning and parenting stress among returnees to Orthodox Judaism with adolescent children. Possible explanatory factors for difficulties, such as attachment insecurity, religious discord in families, and poor community integration, were also explored. Randomly selected samples of returnee and nonreturnee Orthodox Jews with adolescent children (N = 1632) completed measures of attachment, community integration, marital functioning, and parenting stress. Results indicate that returnees report greater family disengagement (lack of warmth), family chaos (lack of control), and parenting stress. They also reported higher religious discord, higher attachment insecurity, and poorer community integration, which all correlated with higher parenting stress, family disengagement (lack of warmth), and family chaos (lack of control). Moreover, differences between returnees and nonreturnees on family functioning and parenting stress were largely mediated by differences in the explanatory factors. These results substantiate previous anecdotal reports and suggest possible avenues for intervention among Orthodox returnees with family difficulties. They also support the relevance of religious factors in family functioning.

375,Age-related differences in responses to thoughts of one's own death: Mortality salience and judgments of moral transgressions,"Two experiments explored age differences in response to reminders of death. Terror management research has shown that death reminders lead to increased adherence to and defense of one's cultural worldview. In Study 1, the effect of mortality salience ({MS}) on evaluations of moral transgressions made by younger and older adults was compared. Whereas younger adults showed the typical pattern of harsher judgments in response to {MS}, older adults did not. Study 2 compared younger and older adults' responses to both the typical {MS} induction and a more subtle death reminder. Whereas younger adults responded to both {MS} inductions with harsher evaluations, older adults made significantly less harsh evaluations after the subtle {MS} induction. Explanations for this developmental shift in responses to reminders of death are discussed.

376,"Misinformation, disinformation, and violent conflict: From Iraq and the 'War on Terror' to future threats to peace","The dissemination and control of information are indispensable ingredients of violent conflict, with all parties involved in a conflict or at war seeking to frame the discussion on their own terms. Those attempts at information control often involve the dissemination of misinformation or disinformation (i.e., information that is incorrect by accident or intent, respectively). We review the way in which misinformation can facilitate violent conflicts and, conversely, how the successful refutation of misinformation can contribute to peace. We illustrate the relevant cognitive principles by examining two case studies. The first, a retrospective case, involves the Iraq War of 2003 and the 'War on Terror.' The second, a prospective case, points to likely future sources of conflict arising from climate change and its likely consequences.

377,Before I die: The impact of time horizon and age on bucket-list goals,"We investigated the effects of time horizon and age on the socioemotional motives underlying individual’s bucket-list goals. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three time-horizon conditions to make a bucket list: (1) an open-ended time horizon (Study 1 \& 2), (2) a 6-month horizon (i.e., 'Imagine you have 6 months to live'; Study 1 \& 2), and (3) a 1-week horizon (Study 2). Goal motives were coded based on socioemotional selectivity theory and psychosocial development theory. Results indicated that time horizon and age produced unique effects on bucket-list goal motives. Extending past findings on people’s motives considering the end of life, the findings suggest that different time horizons and life stages trigger different motives.

378,The relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior,"The purpose of this study was to assess the relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior. Undergraduate students (N = 1,528) completed online measures of prosocial behavior (both daily helping behavior and volunteering), lifetime trauma exposure, and 5 other known correlates (i.e., empathy, agreeableness, religiosity, extraversion, and gender) of prosocial behavior at Time 1. At Time 2, 2 months later, participants (n = 1,281) completed measures of trauma exposure between Time 1 and Time 2 (to identify individuals who experienced a trauma between Time 1 and Time 2; n = 122), prosocial behavior, event-related distress, and well-being. Individuals who had experienced more lifetime traumas engaged in more prosocial behavior, and lifetime trauma exposure explained additional variance in prosocial behavior after accounting for other known correlates. In addition, individuals who had experienced a recent trauma reported engaging in more daily helping behavior than a matched no-trauma comparison group (n = 122). Among recent trauma survivors, engaging in prosocial behavior was associated with greater well-being. Implications for research and practice are addressed.

379,Reactions to ethnic deviance: The role of backlash in racial stereotype maintenance,"Backlash effects are social and economic penalties for counterstereotypical behavior (Rudman \& Phelan, 2008). Five experiments support a model of the role of backlash in racial stereotype maintenance from the standpoint of perceivers and actors (Rudman \& Fairchild, 2004). In Experiment 1, perceivers sabotaged Asians and Whites for succeeding in counterstereotypical domains, thereby preventing their future success. In Experiment 2, a White rapper suffered prejudice and economic discrimination, relative to a Black rapper, and prejudice mediated discrimination. Further, actors threatened by backlash for achievement in cross-racial domains responded to success in ways that bolster ethnic stereotypes. For example, Black men and women who feared backlash for academic skill (Experiment 3), and non-Black (Experiment 4) and non-White (Experiment 5) men who experienced backlash for cross-racial achievement, resorted to defensive strategies that preserve racial stereotypes (e.g., refusing to publicize and pursue counterstereotypical talents).

380,"Generosity, greed, norms, and death—Differential effects of mortality salience on charitable behavior","Terror management theory ({TMT}) states that mortality salience prompts people to follow cultural standards. But many cultures value both generosity and accumulation of wealth. Combining {TMT} with the focus theory of normative conduct, we suggest that whether mortality salience encourages generosity or greed depends on the norm(s) salient in the situation. In Study 1 mortality salience led Americans to give less money to foreign charities. Study 2 replicated this effect, and showed it can be eliminated by activating a generosity norm. However, people who valued money as highly important donated less money following mortality salience. Study 3 showed that following mortality salience and a fairness prime, people behaved more generously when splitting money between themselves and an anonymous partner.

381,Acquisition of the algorithms of social life: A domain-based approach,"Reviewed evidence concerned with the acquisition of regulatory mechanisms (algorithms) that selectively and contingently prepare the young for the diverse features of social life. Proposing that the algorithms of social life are acquired as a domain-based process, the author offers distinctions between social domains preparing the individual for proximity-maintenance within a protective relationship (attachment domain), use and recognition of social dominance (hierarchical power domain), identification and maintenance of the lines dividing 'us' and 'them' (coalitional group domain), negotiation of matched benefits with functional equals (reciprocity domain), and selection and protection of access to sexual partners (mating domain). Flexibility in the implementation of domains occurs at 3 different levels: versatility at a bioecological level, variations in the cognitive representation of individual experience, and cultural and individual variations in the explicit management of social life. Empirical evidence for domain specificity was strongest for the attachment domain; supportive evidence was also found for the distinctiveness of the 4 other domains. Implications are considered at theoretical and applied levels. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Bugental, Daphne Blunt",0,,381
382,"Class, chaos, and the construction of community","Chaotic conditions are a prevalent and threatening feature of social life. Five studies examined whether social class underlies divergent responses to perceptions of chaos in one's social environments and outcomes. The authors hypothesized that when coping with perceptions of chaos, lower class individuals tend to prioritize community, relative to upper class individuals, who instead tend to prioritize material wealth. Consistent with these predictions, when personally confronting chaos, lower class individuals were more communally oriented (Study 1), more connected with their community (Study 2), and more likely to volunteer for a community-building project (Study 3), compared to upper class individuals. In contrast, perceptions of chaos caused upper class individuals to express greater reliance on wealth (Study 4) and prefer financial gain over membership in a close-knit community (Study 5), relative to lower class individuals. These findings suggest that social class shapes how people respond to perceptions of chaos and cope with its threatening consequences.

383,In defense of commitment: The curative power of violated expectations,"A new model of commitment defense in romantic relationships is proposed. It assumes that relationships afford a central resource for affirming meaning and purpose in the world. Consequently, violating expectations about the world outside the relationship can precipitate commitment defense inside the relationship. A meta-analysis of 5 experiments, 2 follow-up correlational studies, and a longitudinal study of the transition to first parenthood supported the model. Experimentally violating conventional expectations about the world (e.g., 'hard work pays off') motivated less satisfied people to defensively affirm their commitment. Similarly, when becoming a parent naturalistically violated culturally conditioned gendered expectations about the division of household labor, less satisfied new mothers and fathers defensively affirmed their commitment from pre-to-post baby. The findings suggest that violating expected associations in the world outside the relationship motivates vulnerable people to set relationship their relationship right, thereby affirming expected associations in the relationship in the face of an unexpected world.

384,"Social movements, structural violence, and conflict transformation in Northern Ireland: The role of loyalist paramilitaries","This article analyzes how social movements and collective actors can affect political and social transformation in a structurally violent society using the case study of Northern Ireland. We focus, in particular, on the crucial role played by collective actors within the loyalist community (those who want to maintain Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom) in bringing about social and political transformation in a society blighted by direct, cultural, and structural violence both during the conflict and subsequent peace process. Drawing on data obtained through in-depth interviews with loyalist activists (including former paramilitaries), the article demonstrates the role and impact of loyalists and loyalism in Northern Ireland’s transition. We identify 5 conflict transformation challenges addressed by loyalist actors in a structurally violent society: de-mythologizing the conflict; stopping direct violence; resisting pressure to maintain the use of violence; development of robust activist identity; and the measurement of progress through reference to the parallel conflict transformation journey of their former republican enemies. The Northern Ireland case demonstrates the necessity for holistic conflict transformation strategies that attempt to stop not only direct attacks but also the cultural and structural violence that underpins and legitimize them. In so doing, the article contributes to a broader understanding of how and why paramilitary campaigns are brought to an end.

385,"Anxious, threatened, and also unethical: How anxiety makes individuals feel threatened and commit unethical acts","People often experience anxiety in the workplace. Across 6 studies, we show that anxiety, both induced and measured, can lead to self-interested unethical behavior. In Studies 1 and 2, we find that compared with individuals in a neutral state, anxious individuals are more willing (a) to participate in unethical actions in hypothetical scenarios and (b) to engage in more cheating to make money in situations that require truthful self-reports. In Studies 3 and 4, we explore the psychological mechanism underlying unethical behaviors when experiencing anxiety. We suggest and find that anxiety increases threat perception, which, in turn, results in self-interested unethical behaviors. Study 5 shows that, relative to participants in the neutral condition, anxious individuals find their own unethical actions to be less problematic than similar actions of others. In Study 6, data from subordinate–supervisor dyads demonstrate that experienced anxiety at work is positively related with experienced threat and unethical behavior. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Kouchaki, Maryam and Desai, Sreedhari D.",0,,385
386,On psychological growth and vulnerability: Basic psychological need satisfaction and need frustration as a unifying principle,"Humans have a potential for growth, integration, and well-being, while also being vulnerable to defensiveness, aggression, and ill-being. Self-determination theory (R. M. Ryan \& E. L. Deci, 2000, Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development and well-being, American Psychologist, Vol. 55, pp. 68–78) argues that satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness both fosters immediate well-being and strengthens inner resources contributing to subsequent resilience, whereas need frustration evokes ill-being and increased vulnerabilities for defensiveness and psychopathology. We briefly review recent research indicating how contextual need support and the experience of need satisfaction promote well-being and different growth manifestations (e.g., intrinsic motivation, internalization), as well as a rapidly growing body of work relating need thwarting and need frustration to ill-being, pursuit of need substitutes, and various forms of maladaptive functioning. Finally, we discuss research on differences in autonomous self-regulation and mindfulness, which serve as factors of resilience.

387,From guilt-oriented to uncertainty-oriented culture: Nietzsche and Weber on the history of theodicy,"A psychology of the emotions should recognize that culture grounds our experience of emotions, particularly existential emotions such as guilt and the anxiety of uncertainty. Nietzsche and Weber present historical models that emphasize the role of culture in solving the problem of theodicy—explaining seemingly unjust suffering—and thereby conditioning the individual's experience of emotion in response to suffering. More important, they identified the transition from cultural premodernity to modernity with the shift from guilt-oriented to uncertainty-oriented culture. Although individuals in premodern cultures tended to interpret suffering in terms of personal inadequacy and guilt, individuals in modern culture tend to interpret suffering in terms of uncertainty and disillusionment. In the present article I review the histories of theodicy of Nietzsche and Weber. This cultural-historical theory is applied to integrate diverse empirical findings from psychology and anthropology relevant to the relationship between culture and existential emotion and to enrich relevant contemporary theory.

389,Extent of trauma exposure and {PTSD} symptom severity as predictors of anxiety-buffer functioning,"Two studies conducted in the aftermath of the Côte d'Ivoire civil war tested the anxiety buffer disruption theory prediction that high war exposure and/or high posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) are associated with a disruption in normal anxiety buffering functioning. In line with predictions, Study 1 indicated that mortality salience (as compared to a control condition) increased immediate death-related thought accessibility in persons with high but not low levels of {PTSD} symptoms. Thus, whereas low {PTSD} symptom participants showed the previously documented apparent suppression of classic priming effects when exposed to death reminders, high {PTSD} symptom participants did not exhibit this defense. Study 2 demonstrated that mortality salience interacted with trauma exposure to affect reports of trauma symptoms. Specifically, it led individuals high in exposure to the war, but not those low in exposure, to report more trauma symptoms than in the control condition. The discussion addresses the role of anxiety buffer functioning in responses to traumatic stress and how the anxiety buffer disruption theory approach relates to other theories of trauma.

390,The psychometric assessment of human life history strategy: A meta-analytic construct validation,"A growing body of empirical literature supports the validity of psychometric assessments of human life history strategies, but no comprehensive quantitative summaries have yet been published. We present a psychometric validation study of a 20-item Short-Form of the Arizona Life History Battery ({ALHB}), the Mini-K, using meta-analytic procedures to survey a multiplicity of published and unpublished studies on English-speaking North American college student samples. Correlations between the Mini-K with other measures of related constructs describe the dimensions of the broader conceptual framework encompassed by human life history strategy and empirically establish a nomological network surrounding the Mini-K by quantitatively characterizing its system of relations to related and unrelated constructs. These constructs include the General Factor of Personality, Mutualistic and Antagonistic Social Strategies, Emotional Intelligence, Executive Functions, Covitality, and Evaluative Self-Assessment as well as other indicators of human life history strategy, including all those comprising the {ALHB} and many others not used in the {ALHB}, and indicators of one’s Romantic Partner’s life history strategy. Although a single measure cannot capture something as complex and multifaceted as life history strategy, both the Mini-K and the {ALHB} of which it is a part, perform as predicted by evolutionary psychological theory within this wider conceptual framework.

391,Ever after: A price story—Afterlife belief salience’s effect on willingness to pay,"Purpose: This paper aims to advance understanding regarding a particular religious belief and buying behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Two online experiments were conducted among diverse respondents. Study 1 used a one-way, between-subjects design with three conditions: afterlife salience, control and mortality salience. The dependent measure was built on the notion of first-price sealed-bid auction. Study 2 used a similar procedure with two conditions: afterlife salience and control. Mortality was made salient in both conditions. Findings: Making afterlife salient boosted the willingness to pay. This effect did not result from mortality salience, which suggests that this research is a unique contribution beyond works rooted in Terror Management Theory. This effect was mediated through positive product thoughts. Originality/value: There has long been an imbalance between theoretical speculation concerning religion and cognition and actual empirical documentation. The present research adds to the emerging body of empirical investigations into this relation. It contributes to the conceptual richness of the stream of literature by examining one aspect of religiosity that has rarely been studied: the belief in afterlife. In addition, the findings go beyond correlational patterns toward discovering nonobvious cause and effect. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is one of the few works that experimentally manipulate the notion of afterlife belief. This research also extends the understanding of pricing and willingness to pay by identifying a subtle environmental influence not recognized before.

392,Why the resistance to statistical innovations? A comment on Sharpe (2013),"Sharpe’s (2013) article considered reasons for the apparent resistance of substantive researchers to the adoption of newer statistical methods recommended by quantitative methodologists, and possible ways to reduce that resistance, focusing on improved communication. The important point that Sharpe missed, however, is that because research methods vary radically from one subarea of psychology to another, a particular statistical innovation may be much better suited to some subareas than others. Although there may be some psychological or logistical explanations that account for resistance to innovation in general, to fully understand the resistance to any particular innovation, it is necessary to consider how that innovation impacts specific subareas of psychology. In this comment, I focus on the movement to replace null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}) with reports of effect sizes and/or confidence intervals, and consider its possible impact on research in which only the direction of the effect is meaningful, and there is no basis for predicting specific effect sizes (and very large samples are rarely used). There are numerous examples of these studies in social psychology, for instance, such as those that deal with priming effects. I use a study in support of terror management theory as my main example. I conclude that the degree to which statistical reformers have overgeneralized their criticisms of {NHST}, and have failed to tailor their recommendations to different types of research, may explain some of the resistance to abandoning {NHST}. Finally, I offer suggestions for improved communication to supplement those presented by Sharpe. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Cohen, Barry H.",0,,392

Our findings show that the phenomenon is robust across various contexts and that multiple factors affect it, such as the severity of the negative consequences associated with saving the larger group. This has also allowed us to better describe the phenomenon and investigate potential explanations. Together, our results suggest that the foreign language effect is most likely attributable to an increase in psychological distance and a reduction in emotional response.

395,A room with a view: Setting influences information disclosure in investigative interviews,"Research on embodied cognition and priming show that human behavior is influenced nonconsciously by the environment in metaphoric ways. Previous research has shown that conceptual priming can lead people to disclose sensitive information (Davis, Soref, Villalobos, \& Mikulincer, 2016; Dawson, Hartwig, \& Brimbal, 2015). Here, we sought to examine whether concepts of openness can be activated to promote disclosure within the interview itself, through the physical setting. In two laboratory studies, participants were exposed to details of a mock environmental terrorism conspiracy through a courier task, which they were subsequently interviewed about in different settings. In Study 1, participants were interviewed in either a room designed to activate openness, or a prototypically enclosed, bare custodial interview room. In Study 2, we manipulated both architectural and interior features of both rooms. Challenging the status quo that a small room is optimal for investigative interviewing, our findings offer compelling evidence that the spaciousness of an interview room can influence a person’s tendency to be 'open' with or 'closed' about information.

396,Embracing athletic identity in the face of threat,"When reminded of the impending end to their athletic career, it may benefit athletes to prioritize other identities and goals that will be more important in the future. However, by applying a general process model of psychological threat and defense (Jonas et al., 2014), we conducted 2 studies to test the idea that individuals may actually report stronger identification as an athlete to counter goal-discrepant perceptions aroused by a sport career threat. Both studies used a between-subjects design, where participants were assigned to a condition in which they either envisioned the end of their athletic career, a control condition, their own mortality (i.e., a universal goal-discrepant threat, Study 1 only), or the end of their student career (Study 2 only). In Study 1, with a sample of interuniversity sport athletes (n = 81), participants in the universal goal-discrepant threat and the end of athletic career threat conditions reported greater identification as an athlete relative to a control condition. Study 2 (n = 85) replicated these findings, and also revealed that reflecting on the end of their athletic career elicited a distinct pattern of identification when contrasted with a condition where participants imagined the end of their student career. These studies provide novel evidence of how a mere reminder about the end of an athletic career can influence athletic identity exclusivity. Consistent with theories of psychological threat and defense, university sport participants may turn toward their athletic identity as a way to counter goal-discrepant thoughts.

In an adult, life span sample, we assessed manifestations of prosocial tendencies across 3 different measurement domains: (a) psychological self-report measures, (b) actual giving choices, and (c) {fMRI}-derived, neural indicators of 'pure altruism.' The latter expressed individuals’ activity in neural valuation areas when charities received money compared to when oneself received money and thus reflected an altruistic concern for others. Results based both on structural equation modeling and unit-weighted aggregate scores revealed a strong higher-order General Benevolence dimension that accounted for variability across all measurement domains. The fact that the neural measures likely reflect pure altruistic tendencies indicates that General Benevolence is based on a genuine concern for others. Furthermore, General Benevolence exhibited a robust increase across the adult life span, potentially providing an explanation for why older adults typically contribute more to the public good than young adults.

A meta-analysis of Nam et al.’s (2013) two studies, the two studies presently reported, and a third supplemental study provide no evidence for asymmetry in dissonance avoidance.

401,Morally injurious experiences and meaning in Salvadorian teachers exposed to violence,"Helping professionals working to alleviate the effects of violence and injustice can confront morally injurious experiences ({MIE}) that violate deeply held moral values/beliefs, placing them at risk for burnout and trauma-related problems (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [{PTSD}]). Focusing on 257 teachers from educational departments throughout El Salvador, we incorporated structural equation modeling ({SEM}) to examine (1) whether exposure to {MIEs} for this population (e.g., betrayal, witnessing harm to an innocent student) are directly linked with higher {PTSD} symptomatology and work-related burnout and (2) whether {MIEs} contribute to these outcomes via meaning made of trauma. {SEM} results revealed that {MIEs} were in fact uniquely linked with {PTSD} symptoms and burnout, above and beyond rates of direct victimization and demographic factors. In addition, greater {MIEs} were indirectly linked with study outcomes via the extent to which teachers were able to make meaning of their identified stressors. These findings support the importance of screening for {MIEs} among helping professionals and also suggest that meaning making could serve as a central mediating factor for how {MIEs} contribute to trauma-related problems among persons working to promote peace and justice in the world.

402,"Characteristics of protracted, intractable conflict: Toward the development of a metaframework-I","Protracted, intractable conflicts mark a new research frontier in the field of conflict studies. These intense, inescapable conflicts over issues such as critical resources, identity, meaning, justice, and power are complex, traumatic, and often resist even the most serious attempts at resolution. But why are they intractable? What characteristics distinguish intractable conflicts from more tractable, resolvable conflicts? Scholars have begun to identify a diverse array of interrelated factors. This article is the first in a three-part series that presents a metaframework for protracted, intractable conflict: a broad conceptual framework for theory building and intervention. This article begins the series by outlining the unique characteristics and challenges posed by conflict in this domain.

403,A dual-process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thoughts: An extension of terror management theory,"Distinct defensive processes are activated by conscious and nonconscious but accessible thoughts of death. Proximal defenses, which entail suppressing death-related thoughts or pushing the problem of death into the distant future by denying one's vulnerability, are rational, threat-focused, and activated when thoughts of death are in current focal attention. Distal terror management defenses, which entail maintaining self-esteem and faith in one's cultural worldview, function to control the potential for anxiety that results from knowing that death is inevitable. These defenses are experiential, are not related to the problem of death in any semantic or logical way, and are increasingly activated as the accessibility of death-related thoughts increases, up to the point at which such thoughts enter consciousness and proximal threat-focused defenses are initiated. Experimental evidence for this analysis is presented. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Pyszczynski, Tom and Greenberg, Jeff and Solomon, Sheldon",0,,403

405,Rival characteristics that provoke jealousy: A study in Iraqi Kurdistan,"This study examined gender differences in the jealousy-evoking nature of rival characteristics among 200 young people from Iraqi Kurdistan. A factor analysis showed exactly the same 5 dimensions of rival characteristics as in Dutch samples, that is, social dominance, physical attractiveness, physical dominance, seductive behavior, and social status. Unlike what was found in The Netherlands, Argentina, and Spain, men and women did not differ in the rival characteristics they found most threatening. Overall, women found the 5 dimensions of rival characteristics threatening to the same extent, whereas men found physical dominance of the rival the least threatening characteristic. With the exception of social dominance of the rival, Kurdish men found all other characteristics more threatening than Dutch men did. With the exception of social dominance and physical attractiveness of the rival, Kurdish women found all other characteristics more threatening than Dutch women did. Only among men did all rival characteristics, except social status, correlate positively with intrasexual competition. The results are interpreted in the context of Kurdistan society and culture, and suggest that classic evolutionary theorizing about the gender differences in the rival characteristics that may evoke jealousy needs to be revised and moderated.

406,"Death, sex, love, and neuroticism: Why is sex such a problem?","Terror management theory posits that sex is a ubiquitous human problem because the creaturely aspects of sex make apparent our animal nature, which reminds us of our vulnerability and mortality. People minimize this threat by investing in the symbolic meaning offered by the cultural worldview. Because people high in neuroticism have difficulty finding or sustaining meaning, sex is a particular problem for them. In Study 1, mortality salience caused high-neuroticism participants to find the physical aspects of sex less appealing. Study 2 revealed that for such individuals thoughts of physical sex increase the accessibility of death-related thoughts. This finding was replicated in Study 3, which also showed that providing meaning by associating sex with love reduced the accessibility of death-related thoughts in response to thoughts of physical sex. These findings provide insight into why people high in neuroticism have conflicting thoughts about sexuality and why sexuality is so often regulated and romanticized.

408,"{COVID}-19, fear and the future: An attachment perspective","This brief paper summarizes and appraises two prominent psychological accounts of the role fear plays in human life: (1) terror management theory and (2) attachment theory, highlighting research demonstrating that attachment security moderates the experience of fear. Moreover, the suggestion is made that fear of loss of loved ones, and fear of loss of love, is the primary source of fear and anxiety in human life. This paper also highlights the importance and value of showing ‘reflective functioning’ regarding our anxieties or ‘mentalizing’ fear so that we are better prepared for inevitable pandemics in the future. Public health infrastructures must be nourished and reinforced, just as heroic economic and technological changes are needed, so that we may more effectively cope with the fears, destruction and death arising on a regular basis on account of the radical adverse events (hotter and bigger wild fires, longer and more damaging storms) brought on by climate changes, directly linked to foolish and greedy human choices and behaviors.

409,Once upon a game: Exploring video game nostalgia and its impact on well-being,"Retro gaming and the renaissance of past video games has been an emerging area of interest for media research within the past years. Yet, there is little empirical research trying to explain the psychological effects and benefits of past-related gaming. This article explores how remembering of past video game experiences relates to nostalgia, a mixed emotion elicited via reflection on the past that shows positive associations to well-being. To this end, a mixed-methods approach was used to investigate prerequisites of nostalgic video game experiences, their nature, and connections to well-being. In a randomized online survey, participants were instructed to elaborate on past (vs. recent) and social (vs. solo) gaming memories. Quantitative analyses indicated that nostalgia was impacted (a) directly by past memories and intrinsic need satisfaction of competence and relatedness within the remembrance, and (b) indirectly by social memories that increased relatedness. Controlling for the associations between need satisfaction and well-being, nostalgia showed significant associations with present feelings of connectedness. Additional qualitative analyses indicated that past memories were more strongly associated with enjoyment and challenge, and social memories were likely to involve close others. These findings are discussed regarding the elicitation of video game nostalgia as well as the application of nostalgic gaming for well-being purposes.

410,Even unpleasant reminders that you are an animal need not disgust you,"Three studies (Ns = 200, 400, 400) tested the hypothesis that we humans feel disgust when reminded of our animal nature. Participants verbally rated their disgust reaction to pictures of humans engaged in various unpleasant actions. For pictures of events that present danger or suffering, accompanied by an explicit and vivid reminder that animals face the same situation, participants reported fear and sadness rather than disgust. For pictures of events that present a norm violation, an explicit animal reminder (relative to a human picture alone) did not lead to a consequent increment in disgust. For pictures of events that present a physically disgusting contamination, an explicit animal reminder (relative to a human picture alone) led to a decrement in disgust. Thus, not all unpleasant animal reminders are disgusting. Some disgusting things may remind us of our animal nature, but they are not disgusting because they do so.

411,"Loneliness, isolation, and social support factors in post-{COVID}-19 mental health","Social support plays a key role in well-being, yet one of the major preventative efforts for reducing the spread of {COVID}-19 involves social distancing. During times of crisis, social support is emphasized as a coping mechanism. This requires many people to change their typical ways of connectedness and assumes that people have existing healthy relationships or access to technology. The purpose of this article was to explore the potential impact of {COVID}-19 on loneliness and well-being. Social support is an important consideration for understanding the impact of {COVID}-19 Psychological First Aid and Skills for Psychological Recovery, which are tools used to inform response methods to help people connect during isolation and are interventions that could be adapted to {COVID}-specific needs for what may be a prolonged isolation and postisolation. Given the many unknowns of {COVID}-19, studies are needed to understand the larger behavioral health impact to ensure resources are available, current, and evidence informed. Future studies are also needed to understand how access to technology may help buffer loneliness and isolation and thus improve the social outcomes of the current pandemic.

Measurement invariance of the scales across {US}-American (N = 262) and German (N = 274) samples is examined by reanalyzing data sets from two published studies. Findings support the theoretically assumed three-factorial model of the German scale and partial scalar invariance across samples.

413,Derogation and distancing as terror management strategies: The moderating role of need for closure and permeability of group boundaries,"Previous research has revealed that when individuals are confronted with criticism of a personally relevant group, mortality salience can lead to either derogation of the source of criticism or distancing from the group. In this article, the authors investigated closure as a potential moderator of these reactions. In Study 1, salience led to greater derogation of a critic of a relevant group among high-need-for-closure participants but led to distancing from the group among low need-for-closure participants. Study 2 showed that when a relevant group was criticized, mortality salience led to greater derogation among participants who were led to believe that the boundaries of that group were impermeable but led to greater distancing among participants who were made aware of the permeable nature of the group boundaries. These findings demonstrate that closure of group membership moderates reactions to criticism of a personally relevant group after mortality salience.

414,The end of the end of ideology,"The 'end of ideology' was declared by social scientists in the aftermath of World War {II}. They argued that (a) ordinary citizens' political attitudes lack the kind of stability, consistency, and constraint that ideology requires; (b) ideological constructs such as liberalism and conservatism lack motivational potency and behavioral significance; (c) there are no major differences in content (or substance) between liberal and conservative points of view; and (d) there are few important differences in psychological processes (or styles) that underlie liberal versus conservative orientations. The end-of-ideologists were so influential that researchers ignored the topic of ideology for many years. However, current political realities, recent data from the American National Election Studies, and results from an emerging psychological paradigm provide strong grounds for returning to the study of ideology. Studies reveal that there are indeed meaningful political and psychological differences that covary with ideological self-placement. Situational variables--including system threat and mortality salience--and dispositional variables--including openness and conscientiousness--affect the degree to which an individual is drawn to liberal versus conservative leaders, parties, and opinions. A psychological analysis is also useful for understanding the political divide between 'red states' and 'blue states.'

417,Shared meaning in children’s evaluations of art: A computational analysis,"Art appreciation is often considered highly individual, but research has shown that there is also a shared element, which may be due to shared meanings and associations triggered by artworks. In the current analysis, we examined semantically based justifications given to aesthetic evaluations of abstract and representational artworks provided by 80 primary schoolchildren, aged 4, 5, 8, and 10 years. Using a computational semantic similarity analysis technique ({UMBC} Ebiquity), the authors found that children showed evidence for shared meaning in response to representational but not abstract art. The effect was present from age 4 through to age 10. In addition, it was found that the presence of semantic elements in the justifications boosted aesthetic appreciation, especially of abstract artworks. This suggests that individually constructed meaning is key to aesthetic appreciation and is, to an extent, independent from the meaning that might be assumed to be inherent in artworks, particularly if it is representational. The authors evaluate their findings in relation to aesthetic and developmental theories and make suggestions for future research. They argue that the current data, alongside calibrating analyses that apply their randomization and semantic analysis protocol to children’s picture naming responses, further demonstrate the robustness of the computational semantic similarity analysis method, with great potential for further studies in semantic interpretation of art or other types of stimuli.

418,Gratefulness and subjective well-being: Social connectedness and presence of meaning as mediators,"The association between gratefulness and well-being is well established; however, few studies have examined the mechanisms that underlie this association. The broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001) posits that positive emotions broaden individuals’ momentary thought–action repertoires, which serve to build personal resources that can be drawn upon during future stressful encounters. Based on this theory, the current study examined whether gratefulness, a positive emotion, would build social and cognitive resources in terms of social connectedness and presence of meaning in life (i.e., mediators), which subsequently contribute to subjective well-being ({SWB}). A total of 232 students participated in an online survey at 2 different time points (3 months apart). The mediational hypothesis was tested by latent change score analyses using structural equation modeling techniques. The results showed that changes in gratefulness predicted changes in social connectedness and presence of meaning in life, which, in turn, predicted changes in {SWB}. The study’s findings provided further support for the broaden-and-build theory and suggested that gratefulness is an important positive emotion that contributes to {SWB} through increased social connectedness and a greater presence of meaning in life.

419,Contingencies of self-worth,"Research on self-esteem has focused almost exclusively on level of trait self-esteem to the neglect of other potentially more important aspects such as the contingencies on which self-esteem is based. Over a century ago, W. James (1890) argued that self-esteem rises and falls around its typical level in response to successes and failures in domains on which one has staked self-worth. We present a model of global self-esteem that builds on James' insights and emphasizes contingencies of self-worth. This model can help to (a) point the way to understanding how self-esteem is implicated in affect, cognition, and self-regulation of behavior, (b) suggest how and when self-esteem is implicated in social problems; (c) resolve debates about the nature and functioning of self-esteem; (d) resolve paradoxes in related literatures, such as why people who are stigmatized do not necessarily have low self-esteem and why self-esteem does not decline with age; and (e) suggest how self-esteem is causally related to depression. In addition, this perspective raises questions about how contingencies of self-worth are acquired and how they change, whether they are primarily a resource or a vulnerability, and whether some people have noncontingent self-esteem.

However, the underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms behind how and when suicide contagion occurs have been, up to this point, hazily understood. The present study: (a) tested whether individuals with depressed affect respond differently to celebrity suicides widely publicized by the media compared with those who do not have depressed affect, (b) measured 2 potential cognitive mechanisms that may be involved in suicide contagion, death-thought accessibility and attitudes about the acceptability and normality of suicide, and (c) compared responses to widely publicized suicide versus accidental death and natural death. The findings highlight a key moderator—depressive affect—that predicts the likelihood of being susceptible to suicide contagion effects following media coverage of a suicide death, clarify that its boundary conditions include cases of accidental death, and elucidate 2 cognitive mechanisms, death-thought accessibility and attitudes toward suicide acceptability and normality.

422,Multicultural experience enhances creativity: The when and how,"Many practices aimed at cultivating multicultural competence in educational and organizational settings (e.g., exchange programs, diversity education in college, diversity management at work) assume that multicultural experience fosters creativity. In line with this assumption, the research reported in this article is the first to empirically demonstrate that exposure to multiple cultures in and of itself can enhance creativity. Overall, the authors found that extensiveness of multicultural experiences was positively related to both creative performance (insight learning, remote association, and idea generation) and creativity-supporting cognitive processes (retrieval of unconventional knowledge, recruitment of ideas from unfamiliar cultures for creative idea expansion). Furthermore, their studies showed that the serendipitous creative benefits resulting from multicultural experiences may depend on the extent to which individuals open themselves to foreign cultures, and that creativity is facilitated in contexts that deemphasize the need for firm answers or existential concerns. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for promoting creativity in increasingly global learning and work environments.

423,The case for double-blind lineup administration,"Many have recommended that lineups be conducted by administrators who do not know which lineup member is the suspect (i.e., a double-blind administration). Single-blind lineup administration, in which the administrator knows which lineup member is the suspect, increases the rate at which witnesses identify suspects, increasing the likelihood that both innocent and guilty suspects are identified. Although the increase in correct identifications of the guilty may appear desirable, in fact, this increase in correct identifications is the result of impermissible suggestion on the part of the administrator. In addition to these effects on witness choices, single-blind administration influences witness confidence through an administrator’s feedback to witnesses about their choices, reducing the correlation between witness confidence and accuracy. Finally, single-blind administration influences police reports of the witness’s identification behavior, with the same witness behavior resulting in different outcomes for suspects depending upon whether the administrator knew which lineup member was the suspect. Administrators who know which lineup member is the suspect in an identification procedure emit behaviors that increase the likelihood that witnesses will choose the suspect, primarily by causing witnesses who would have chosen a filler (known innocent member of the lineup who is not the suspect) to choose the suspect. To avoid impermissible suggestion, photo arrays and lineups should be administered using double-blind procedures.

425,Implicit self-esteem compensation: Automatic threat defense,"Four experiments demonstrated implicit self-esteem compensation ({ISEC}) in response to threats involving gender identity (Experiment 1), implicit racism (Experiment 2), and social rejection (Experiments 3-4). Under conditions in which people might be expected to suffer a blow to self-worth, they instead showed high scores on 2 implicit self-esteem measures. There was no comparable effect on explicit self-esteem. However, {ISEC} was eliminated following self-affirmation (Experiment 3). Furthermore, threat manipulations increased automatic intergroup bias, but {ISEC} mediated these relationships (Experiments 2-3). Thus, a process that serves as damage control for the self may have negative social consequences. Finally, pretest anxiety mediated the relationship between threat and {ISEC} (Experiment 3), whereas {ISEC} negatively predicted anxiety among high-threat participants (Experiment 4), suggesting that {ISEC} may function to regulate anxiety. The implications of these findings for automatic emotion regulation, intergroup bias, and implicit self-esteem measures are discussed.

In the present research, we primed mortality salience, shown to impair reasoning performance in previous studies, to see whether it inhibits subjectivist moral judgments in three separate experiments. In Experiment 3, we also investigated whether impaired reasoning performance indeed mediates the effect of mortality salience on subjectivism. The results of the three experiments consistently showed that people in the mortality salience group reported significantly less subjectivist responses than the control group, and impaired reasoning performance partially mediates it. Overall, the results are consistent with the dual-process interpretation of {TMT} and suggest that not only normative but also meta-ethical judgments can be explained by this model.

Building from the existence bias, the longer‐is‐better effect posits that which exists is good and that which has existed for longer is better. Integrating terror management theory, it was reasoned that mortality reminders fostering a motivation to at least symbolically transcend death would lead participants to evaluate older object more positively as they signal robustness of existence. Participants were reminded of death (vs. control) and evaluated new, 20‐, or 100‐year‐old objects. Results indicated death reminders resulted in greater valuation of older objects. Findings are discussed with implications for terror management theory, the longer‐is‐better effect, ageism, materialism, and consumer behaviour.

428,Interdependent self-construals mitigate the fear of death and augment the willingness to become a martyr,"Humans are motivated by a quest for significance that is threatened by the inevitability of death. However, individuals with interdependent self-construals, self-representations that reflect embeddedness with and connection to others, are able to extend themselves through time and space through their linkage to a larger social group. The present set of 5 experiments tested the hypotheses that individuals primed with an interdependent self-construal would fear death less and would be more willing to face harm for the sake of the group than individuals with an independent self-construal, that is, self-representations that reflect autonomy and independence from others ('I have self-control'). The results show that interdependent self-construals, compared to independent self-construals, attenuate death anxiety, reduce the avoidance of death, increase the approach to death-related stimuli, induce a greater willingness to become a martyr, and induce a greater willingness to sacrifice the self for other members of important groups.

429,From the Grave to the Cradle: Evidence That Mortality Salience Engenders a Desire for Offspring,"On the basis of terror management theory, the authors hypothesized that reminders of mortality (mortality salience) should promote the desire for offspring to the extent that it does not conflict with other self-relevant worldviews that also serve to manage existential concerns. In 3 studies, men, but not women, desired more children after mortality salience compared with various control conditions. In support of the authors' hypothesis that women's desire for offspring was inhibited as a function of concerns about career success, Study 3 showed that career strivings moderated the effect of mortality salience on a desire for offspring for female participants only; furthermore, Study 4 revealed that when the compatibility of having children and a career was made salient, female participants responded to mortality salience with an increased number of desired children. Taken together, the findings suggest that a desire for offspring can function as a terror management defense mechanism.

430,Can reflecting on personal values online increase positive beliefs about counseling?,"This research developed and tested an online values-affirmation exercise to attenuate threat and enhance positive beliefs about counseling among individuals struggling with mental health concerns. There is evidence that reflecting on personal values (values-affirmation) is an effective approach to eliciting self-affirmation—a psychological process that temporarily bolsters self-worth in order to forestall maladaptive, self-protective responses to counseling information. The present study utilized a randomized 2-group between-subjects design to test the effectiveness of a values-affirmation exercise with an online sample (N = 186) of adults who reported struggling with a mental health concern. It was predicted that values-affirmation would reduce threat related to reading mental health information and increase positive beliefs about counseling. Results indicated that those in the values-affirmation condition reported fewer negative emotions such as feeling upset, irritable, hostile, and scared after reading mental health information, indicating that the information was perceived as less threatening. There was also evidence that engaging in values-affirmation was associated with greater anticipated growth in counseling and greater intent to seek counseling, reflecting greater positive beliefs about counseling. Overall, the results suggest that reflecting on personal values may have the potential to enhance the positive effects of online psychoeducation.

431,"Persistent grief in the aftermath of mass violence: The predictive roles of posttraumatic stress symptoms, self-efficacy, and disrupted worldview","This study tested a conceptual model merging anxiety buffer disruption and social–cognitive theories to predict persistent grief severity among students who lost a close friend, significant other, and/or professor/teacher in tragic university campus shootings. A regression-based path model tested posttraumatic stress ({PTS}) symptom severity 3 to 4 months postshooting (Time 1) as a predictor of grief severity 1 year postshootings (Time 2), both directly and indirectly through cognitive processes (self-efficacy and disrupted worldview). Results revealed a model that predicted 61\% of the variance in Time 2 grief severity. Hypotheses were supported, demonstrating that Time 1 {PTS} severity indirectly, positively predicted Time 2 grief severity through undermining self-efficacy and more severely disrupting worldview. Findings and theoretical interpretation yield important insights for future research and clinical application.

432,Retaliation as a response to procedural unfairness: A self-regulatory approach,"When does procedural unfairness result in retaliation, and why do recipients of unfair treatment sometimes pursue and other times inhibit retaliation? Five studies addressed these questions. The authors proposed and found that regulatory focus moderates retaliation against an unfairness-enacting authority: Promotion-focus participants were more likely to retaliate than prevention-focus participants. Promotion focus was associated with, and also heightened the accessibility of, the individual self. In turn, individual-self accessibility influenced retaliation. In fact, prevention-focus participants were as retaliatory as promotion-focus participants under conditions of high individual-self accessibility. Implications for the procedural fairness and regulatory focus literatures are discussed, and suggestions for future research are offered.

433,"Windows into nothingness: Terror management, meaninglessness, and negative reactions to modern art","Why do people dislike art that they find meaningless? According to terror management theory, maintaining a basic meaningful view of reality is a key prerequisite for managing concerns about mortality. Therefore, mortality salience should decrease liking for apparently meaningless art, particularly among those predisposed to unambiguous knowledge. Accordingly, mortality salience diminished affection for modern art in Study 1, and this effect was shown in Study 2 to be specific to individuals with a high personal need for structure ({PNS}). In Studies 3 and 4, mortality salient high-{PNS} participants disliked modern art unless it was imbued with meaning, either by means of a title or a personal frame of reference induction. Discussion focused on the roles of meaninglessness, {PNS}, and art in terror management.

Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that people responded to taboo trade-offs that monetized sacred values with moral outrage and cleansing. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that racial egalitarians were least likely to use, and angriest at those who did use, race-tainted base rates and that egalitarians who inadvertently used such base rates tried to reaffirm their fair-mindedness. Experiment 5 revealed that Christian fundamentalists were most likely to reject heretical counterfactuals that applied everyday causal schemata to Biblical narratives and to engage in moral cleansing after merely contemplating such possibilities. Although the results fit the sacred-value-protection model ({SVPM}) better than rival formulations, the {SVPM} must draw on cross-cultural taxonomies of relational schemata to specify normative boundaries on thought.

435,Why does existential threat promote intergroup violence? Examining the role of retributive justice and cost-benefit utility motivations,"The current research examined the role of retributive justice and cost-benefit utility motivations in the process through which mortality salience increases support for violent responses to intergroup conflict. Specifically, previous research has shown that mortality salience often encourages political violence, especially when perceptions of retributive justice are activated. The current research examined whether mortality salience directly activates a justice mindset over a cost-benefit utility mindset, and whether this justice mindset is associated with support for political violence. In Study 1 (N = 209), mortality salience was manipulated among Israeli participants who then read about a Hamas attack on Israel with either no casualties or many casualties, after which justice and utility motivations for retribution were assessed. Study 2 (N = 112), examined whether the link between death primes and support for an Israeli preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities is mediated by justice or cost-benefit utility considerations. Results of both studies revealed that primes of death increased justice-related motivations, and these motives, rather than utility motives, were associated with support for violence. Findings suggest that existential concerns often fuel violent intergroup conflict because they increase desire for retributive justice, rather than increase belief that violence is an effective strategy. These findings expand our knowledge on the motivations for intergroup violence, and shed experimental light on real-life eruptions of violent conflict indicating that when existential concerns are salient, as they often are during violent conflict, the decision to engage in violence often disregards the utility of violence, and leads to the preference for violent solutions to political problems—even when these solutions make little practical sense.

436,How collective and personal mortality salience impacts antagonism against worldview-threatening others,"Abstract We conducted a study in Japan using terror management theory (N = 115) to examine these predictions: first, personal morality salience ({MS}) would increase antagonism against worldview-threatening others; second, priming to reinforce collective identity would be more effective to strengthen participants’ sense of security and thus lower antagonism toward an in-group critic under personal {MS} than collective {MS}. The results revealed a significant interaction between {MS} types and identity priming. Participants were most tolerant toward worldview-threatening others upon awareness of a crisis threatening the group providing them collective identity. These findings provide insight into understanding individual behaviors during social unrest. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Fa, Hui and Kugihara, Naoki",1,,436
437,Affective forecasting and medication decision making in breast-cancer prevention,"Objective: Over 2 million American women at elevated risk for breast cancer are eligible to take chemoprevention medications such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, which can cut in half the risk of developing breast cancer, but which also have a number of side effects. Historically, very few at-risk women have opted to use chemoprevention medications. Affective forecasting theory suggests that people may avoid these medications if they expect taking them to increase their health-related stress. Method: After receiving an individually tailored decision aid that provided personalized information about the risks and benefits of these medications, 661 women at elevated risk of breast cancer were asked to make 3 affective forecasts, predicting what their level of health-related stress would be if they took tamoxifen, raloxifene, or neither medication. They also completed measures of decisional preferences and intentions, and at a 3-month follow-up, reported on whether or not they had decided to use either medication. Results: On the affective forecasting items, very few women ({\textless}10\%) expected the medications to reduce their health-related stress, relative to no medication at all. Participants with more negative affective forecasts about taking a chemoprevention medication expressed lower preferences and intentions for using the medications (Cohen’s ds from 0.74 to 0.79) and were more likely to have opted against using medication at follow-up ({OR} range = 1.34–2.66). Conclusion: These findings suggest that affective forecasting may explain avoidance of breast-cancer chemoprevention medications. They also highlight the need for more research aimed at integrating emotional content into decision aids.

438,Can We Really Do Without Self-Esteem? Comment on Crocker and Park (2004),"Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a superordinate goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely difficult and probably impossible for people to stop pursuing self-esteem. Although they agree that investment in others' welfare may circumvent some of the negative consequences of self-esteem pursuit, the authors argue that the self-esteem implications of other-oriented behavior will inevitably be a powerful motivating force. Finally, the authors propose that self-esteem derived from self-determined standards of value may reduce defensiveness, closed-mindedness, and indifference to others, as well as promote personal growth, but they acknowledge the daunting barriers to the attainment of such self-determined bases of self-worth.

439,Mortality salience increases personal relevance of the norm of reciprocity,"Research on terror management theory found evidence that people under mortality salience strive to live up to salient cultural norms and values, like egalitarianism, pacifism, or helpfulness. A basic, strongly internalized norm in most human societies is the norm of reciprocity: people should support those who supported them (i.e., positive reciprocity), and people should injure those who injured them (i.e., negative reciprocity), respectively. In an experiment (N = 98; 47 women, 51 men), mortality salience overall significantly increased personal relevance of the norm of reciprocity (M = 4.45, {SD} = 0.65) compared to a control condition (M = 4.19, {SD} = 0.59). Specifically, under mortality salience there was higher motivation to punish those who treated them unfavourably (negative norm of reciprocity). Unexpectedly, relevance of the norm of positive reciprocity remained unaffected by mortality salience. Implications and limitations are discussed.

440,An existential–integrative (ei) treatment of adolescent substance abuse,"This article offers an existential–integrative ({EI}; Schneider, 2008) treatment of adolescent substance abuse. Adolescence is a time of great transition and search for identity, meaning, and purpose in life. Struggles during this developmental stage are reflected in internalizing disorders, including depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide, as well as externalizing disorders, including impulse and conduct/behavioral disorders. The authors argue that adolescents who experience higher levels of existential anxiety will be at increased risk for the development of a substance abuse disorder. Viewed within this framework, alcohol and drug use may serve a twofold purpose: (a) it acts as an escape from the throes of existential anxiety and (b) it provides the adolescent with a pseudo identity as the 'stoner,' the 'wild child,' the 'rebel,' and so forth To support this argument, we (a) briefly review key developmental characteristics of adolescence and the experience of existential anxiety within this stage of development, (b) review the prevalence, incidence, and sequelae of adolescent substance abuse, (c) review existing theoretical conceptualizations of adolescent substance abuse, and (d) propose ways {EI} approaches can be incorporated with the existing empirically supported treatments to improve outcome.

441,Age and gender differences in self-esteem—A cross-cultural window,"Research and theorizing on gender and age differences in self-esteem have played a prominent role in psychology over the past 20 years. However, virtually all empirical research has been undertaken in the United States or other Western industrialized countries, providing a narrow empirical base from which to draw conclusions and develop theory. To broaden the empirical base, the present research uses a large Internet sample (N = 985,937) to provide the first large-scale systematic cross-cultural examination of gender and age differences in self-esteem. Across 48 nations, and consistent with previous research, we found age-related increases in self-esteem from late adolescence to middle adulthood and significant gender gaps, with males consistently reporting higher self-esteem than females. Despite these broad cross-cultural similarities, the cultures differed significantly in the magnitude of gender, age, and Gender × Age effects on self-esteem. These differences were associated with cultural differences in socioeconomic, sociodemographic, gender-equality, and cultural value indicators. Discussion focuses on the theoretical implications of cross-cultural research on self-esteem.

442,Nostalgia fosters self-continuity: Uncovering the mechanism (social connectedness) and consequence (eudaimonic well-being),"Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for one’s past, is an emotion that arises from self-relevant and social memories. Nostalgia functions, in part, to foster self-continuity, that is, a sense of connection between one’s past and one’s present. This article examined, in 6 experiments, how nostalgia fosters self-continuity and the implications of that process for well-being. Nostalgia fosters self-continuity by augmenting social connectedness, that is, a sense of belongingness and acceptance (Experiments 1–4). Nostalgia-induced self-continuity, in turn, confers eudaimonic well-being, operationalized as subjective vitality (i.e., a feeling of aliveness and energy; Experiments 5–6). The findings clarify and expand the benefits of nostalgia for both the self-system and psychological adjustment.

Studies 1-3 revealed that activating thoughts of one's parent in response to mortality salience ({MS}) reduced death-thought accessibility and worldview defense and increased feelings of self-worth. Studies 4-5 demonstrated that {MS} led to greater ease of recalling positive maternal interactions and greater difficulty recalling negative interactions, and increased attraction to a stranger who was described as being similar to one's parent. If reliance on parents for terror management purposes reflects the operation of attachment mechanisms, then such effects should vary on the basis of an individual's attachment style. Study 6 demonstrated that, after {MS}, insecure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with their parents, whereas secure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with romantic partners.

However, a meta-analysis of this literature reveals strong evidence of either publication bias or p-hacking (or both). We then report 8 studies with a total sample of over 1,600 participants which sought to reproduce these effects. None of the studies, including one that was fully preregistered, was successful.

446,Why does choice enhance treatment effectiveness? Using placebo treatments to demonstrate the role of personal control,"In modern health care, individuals frequently exercise choice over health treatment alternatives. A growing body of research suggests that when individuals choose between treatment options, treatment effectiveness can increase, although little experimental evidence exists clarifying this effect. Four studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that exercising choice over treatment alternatives enhances outcomes by providing greater personal control. Consistent with this possibility, in Study 1 individuals who chronically desired control reported less pain from a laboratory pain task when they were able to select between placebo analgesic treatments. Study 2 replicated this finding with an auditory discomfort paradigm. In Study 3, the desire for control was experimentally induced, and participants with high desire for control benefited more from a placebo treatment when they were able to choose their treatment. Study 4 revealed that the benefit of choice on treatment efficacy was partially mediated by thoughts of personal control. This research suggests that when individuals desire control, choice over treatment alternatives improves treatment effectiveness by enhancing personal control.

In Study 1, mortality salience led to more severe judgments of transgressions only among anxious–ambivalent and avoidant persons but not among secure persons. In addition, whereas anxious–ambivalent persons showed immediate and delayed increases in severity judgments, avoidant persons showed this response only after a delay period. In Study 2, anxious–ambivalent persons showed immediate and delayed increases in death-thought accessibility after death reminders. Avoidant and secure persons showed this effect only after a delay period. Study 3 revealed that worldview defense in response to mortality salience reduced death-thought accessibility only among avoidant persons. Studies 4–5 revealed that mortality salience led to an increase in the sense of symbolic immortality as well as in the desire of intimacy only among secure persons, but not among avoidant and anxious–ambivalent persons.

448,When autocratic leaders become an option—Uncertainty and self-esteem predict implicit leadership preferences,"We investigated the impact of uncertainty on leadership preferences and propose that the conjunction of self-esteem level and stability is an important moderator in this regard. Self-threatening uncertainty is aversive and activates the motivation to regain control. People with high and stable self-esteem should be confident of achieving this goal by self-determined amelioration of the situation and should therefore show a stronger preference for democratic leadership under conditions of uncertainty. By contrast, people with low and unstable self-esteem should place their trust and hope in the abilities of powerful others, resulting in a preference for autocratic leadership. Studies 1a and 1b validate explicit and implicit leadership measures and demonstrate a general prodemocratic default attitude under conditions of certainty. Studies 2 and 3 reveal a democratic reaction for individuals with stable high self-esteem and a submissive reaction for individuals with unstable low self-esteem under conditions of uncertainty. In Study 4, this pattern is cancelled out when individuals evaluate leadership styles from a leader instead of a follower perspective.

Social theorists posit that the strength of weak ties comes from the opportunities that they present. Weak ties offer opportunities to meet others, expand networks, and become more embedded in our communities. Therefore, for the author, the events of 4/16 represent not only the loss of a friend but also a loss of opportunity. The {VT} shootings have pushed him to consider whether personal relationships and social networks can be objectified to the point that they may be managed. On a second analytical level, the shootings have pushed him to ask how local governments may incorporate social networks, community, and social capital into emergency planning and recovery efforts.

450,The quest for meaning: Religious affiliation differences in the correlates of religious quest and search for meaning in life,"Religious traditions are considered to provide their members with a way to integrate their experiences into a coherent, comprehensible whole; functioning as a meaning system. Given that religious traditions vary in certain ways, the meaning systems they provide to their members might also differ from one another. The present study was concerned with whether seeking existential meaning in religion and life is compatible with other expressions of religiousness across denominations. Using a multigroups application of path analysis, we investigated whether the relations of two forms of existential seeking, secular (search for meaning in life) and sacred (religious quest), with several religious and psychological well-being measures differed as a function of denomination in a sample of Catholic and Protestant young adults (Study 1; N = 284) and a sample of Catholic, Evangelical, and Non-Evangelical Protestant young adults (Study 2; N = 454). Although comparisons across studies are difficult because the 'Protestant' category in Study 1 could have included both Evangelical and non-Evangelical Protestants, one consistent pattern did emerge: there were no denomination-based differences in any of the relations of search for meaning with any of the religiousness variables in either study. Also, in both studies, Catholics demonstrated a positive relation of search for meaning with religious quest and negative relations of search for meaning with presence of meaning in life and overall religiousness. Results for religious quest appeared unstable across studies, raising possible questions about its measurement qualities. Implications for the study of cultural and existential factors and religion are discussed.

452,"That could have been me: Director deaths, {CEO} mortality salience, and corporate prosocial behavior","Mortality salience—the awareness of the inevitability of death—is often traumatic. However, it can also be associated with a range of positive, self-transcendent cognitive responses, such as a greater desire to help others, contribute to society, and make a more meaningful contribution in one’s life and career. In this study, we provide evidence of a link between chief executive officer ({CEO})mortality salience—triggered by the death of a director at the same firm—and a subsequent increase in firm-level prosocial behavior or corporate social responsibility ({CSR}). We further show that this core relationship is amplified in situations where the death of the director is likely to have been especially salient (i.e., the director was appointed within the {CEO}’s tenure, or the death was sudden/expected). In supplementary analyses, we find suggestive evidence of increased {CEO} prosociality in other professional domains as well as evidence that prosociality seems to be preferentially directed toward ingroups.

Results from 3 studies provided convergent evidence that when participants were in an experiential mode, mortality salience produced the typical worldview defense effect, but when participants were in a rational mode it did not. Study 4 revealed that mortality salience also led to a delayed increase in the accessibility of death-related thoughts only when participants were in an experiential mode. These results supported the notion that worldview defense is intensified only if individuals are in an experiential mode when considering their mortality.

In Study 1, 187 college students (81 Appalachian, 106 non-Appalachian) completed an online survey of their cultural and academic values, and provided their current grade point average. Results confirmed that cultural values are also promoted at school, and that the Appalachian students who embodied collectivistic cultural and academic values performed better than non-Appalachian students who embodied collectivistic values.

This study examined daily meaning salience and physical activity in previously inactive exercise initiates. Method: Inactive adults (N = 80, 78\% female, Mage = 43 years, {SD} = 11 years) intending to increase physical activity participated in a daily diary study. At baseline, participants completed self-report questionnaires of demographics, global meaning and purpose, depressive symptoms, and motivation. Fitness center attendance was extracted from the member database. Participants self-reported meaning salience, positive mood, negative mood, and physical activity (duration in minutes; intensity in ratings of perceived exertion) daily for the first 28 days. Multilevel and multiple regression analyses were used. Results: Multilevel models revealed that controlling for demographics, mood, and motivation, for every standard deviation increase in meaning salience, participants were 44\% more likely to visit the fitness center, odds ratio ({OR}) = 1.44, 95\% {CI} [1.24,1.68], p {\textless} .001. Further, increases in meaning salience above average were positively related to physical activity duration, β = .19, p {\textless} .001, and intensity, β = .13, p {\textless} .001. Global meaning and purpose were not significantly related to physical activity duration, physical activity intensity, or fitness center visits over the 28 days. Conclusions: Results suggest that increased meaning salience, but not global meaning or purpose, is associated with physical activity participation in previously inactive exercise initiates, and may be a proximal predictor of physical activity behavior. Future research should use ecological momentary assessment ({EMA}) designs to examine the relationship within days and over longer intervals.

The current study explores whether or not orthodoxy, fundamentalism, intrinsic religiosity, quest, and immanence are related to support for legal actions against parents who refuse medical treatment for their children in favor of faith healing. Participants read 6 scenarios, which varied factors such as the child’s ailment and the type of treatment that would be required, and indicated support for legal actions against parents who used faith healing. Greater support for legal actions was positively associated with fundamentalism, evangelism, and immanence, and negatively associated with quest. Also, individuals supported legal action against parents more when the child’s illness was considered curable rather than incurable, suggesting that the effectiveness of traditional medicine might relate to support for punishment. Results are the first step in explaining how religious characteristics relate to attitudes toward faith healing.

458,Prosocial attitudes toward money from terror management perspective: Death transcendence through spirituality,"Based on Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), we suggest that spirituality and prosocial attitudes toward money have a similar defensive function in resisting existential anxiety. In mortality salient ({MS}) situations, both spirituality and prosocial money attitudes afford symbolic immortality by self-transcendent connections. In four studies, we found that activating death awareness weakened people’s subjective love of money (Study 1) and predicted increased spending willingness on prosocial rather than proself goals (Studies 2, 3, and 4). More importantly, {MS} effects on money attitudes were smaller when people’s trait spirituality was high (vs. low; Studies 1, 2, 3) and when people were primed to experience spirituality (vs. happiness control condition; Study 4). For low spirituality people, the association between {MS} and prosocial spending also depended on the capacity of money spending to contribute positively to one’s feelings of self-worth (Study 3). Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.

459,Influence of betrayal trauma on death anxiety,"Existentially oriented thinkers propose that anxiety about one’s eventual demise (i.e., death anxiety) is a salient feature of the human condition and the underlying cause of psychological distress. They further propose that exposure to trauma is likely to evoke death anxiety, an idea that has been supported by the research literature. Research also suggests that trauma with a high degree of betrayal (high betrayal trauma) has an especially pernicious effect on psychological distress. However, this has not yet been demonstrated with respect to death anxiety in particular. In this study, we examined the incremental effects of high betrayal trauma and other traumatic experiences with lower degrees of betrayal on death anxiety in a large sample of college students (N = 915) using a Bayesian approach to multiple linear regression. Results suggest that high betrayal has a positive incremental influence on death anxiety over and above other forms of trauma and is the sole predictor of death anxiety. These results extend and integrate the research literature on death anxiety and betrayal trauma, further underscoring the association between high betrayal trauma and psychological distress. Directions for future research and potential clinical implications are also discussed.

Results indicated that wartime participants increasingly valued power and superiority, scoring significantly higher on social dominance orientation and self-enhancement values relative to pre-war participants. Wartime participants also highly valued social control and security, scoring significantly higher on right-wing authoritarianism and conservatism values compared to pre-war participants. These results demonstrate that psychological orientations (attitudes and values) vary as a function of unfolding historical events.

461,Intimately connected: The importance of partner responsiveness for experiencing sexual desire,"Sexual desire tends to subside gradually over time, with many couples failing to maintain desire in their long-term relationships. Three studies employed complementary methodologies to examine whether partner responsiveness, an intimacy-building behavior, could instill desire for one’s partner. In Study 1, participants were led to believe that they would interact online with their partner. In reality, they interacted with either a responsive or an unresponsive confederate. In Study 2, participants interacted face-to-face with their partner, and judges coded their displays of responsiveness and sexual desire. Study 3 used a daily experiences methodology to examine the mechanisms underlying the responsiveness–desire linkage. Overall, responsiveness was associated with increased desire, but more strongly in women. Feeling special and perceived partner mate value explained the responsiveness–desire link, suggesting that responsive partners were seen as making one feel valued as well as better potential mates for anyone and thus as more sexually desirable.

Using 6 samples (including multisource and multiwave data), the authors developed a reliable scale with a unidimensional factor structure that replicated across 4 separate samples. The scale possessed both convergent and discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity was demonstrated through the scale's relation with basic needs, well-being, job attitudes, job performance, and withdrawal. Overall, the present study suggests that the Workplace Ostracism Scale is a reliable and valid measure and that the workplace ostracism construct has important implications for both individuals and organizations.

463,Defensive pride and consensus: strength in imaginary numbers,"Failure (Study 1) and attachment separation thoughts (Study 2) caused exaggerated consensus estimates for personal beliefs about unrelated social issues. This compensatory consensus effect was most pronounced among defensively proud individuals, that is, among those with the combination of high explicit and low implicit self-esteem (Study 1) and the combination of high attachment avoidance and low attachment anxiety (Study 2). In Study 3, another form of defensive pride, narcissism, was associated with exaggerated consensual worldview defense after a system-injustice threat. In Study 4, imagined consensus reduced subjective salience of proud individuals' troubling thoughts. Compensatory consensus is seen as a kind of defensive self-affirmation that defensively proud people turn to for insulation from distressing thoughts.

464,The impact of trauma and disrupted anxiety buffer defenses on alcohol cravings and alcohol thought accessibility,"Excessive alcohol use results in devastating social, physical, and financial consequences. One clinical population that suffers disproportionately from alcohol use disorders ({AUD}) is those who have experienced significant trauma. The self-medication hypothesis, which suggests that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) rely on alcohol to treat underlying psychiatric difficulties, offers a preliminary model to understand this psychiatric comorbidity. Study authors hypothesized that integrating Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) and Anxiety Buffer Disruption Theory ({ABDT}) into this conceptual framework would provide a more comprehensive model from which to understand the high rates of comorbid {AUDs} and {PTSD}. {TMT} argues that individuals have cognitively evolved to recognize their own mortality, and have subsequently developed psychological defenses to ward against this ubiquitous anxiety. {ABDT} extends this theory to suggest that these anxiety-buffering defenses are rendered ineffective by extreme trauma, resulting in the constant experience of anxiety and development of {PTSD}. As such, this study attempted to integrate the self-medication hypothesis, {TMT}, and {ABDT} to explore whether individuals with trauma symptomatology endorsed increased alcohol cravings and alcohol thought accessibility in the context of impaired anxiety buffer defenses. Participants (N = 243) were randomly assigned to receive either a mortality salience or control prime, completed measures of traditional anxiety buffering defenses, and completed assessments of their cravings for alcohol and unconscious thoughts of alcohol. Results supported a novel finding: that participants responded to mortality reminders with increased alcohol thought accessibility, suggesting that unconscious thoughts of alcohol are, in themselves, an anxiety-buffering defense.

465,The influence of sexuality stereotypes on men's experience of gender-role incongruence,"For men especially, gender roles are highly conflated with sexuality stereotypes (Lehavot \& Lambert, 2007). As such, we examined the specific role of gay salience in heterosexual men's task experience of gender role incongruency. We predicted that heterosexual men would show a reduction in performance and motivation when working on a feminine task under gay salience. Studies 1a and 1b established elementary teaching and nursing as feminine domains and as nonheterosexual. Study 2 confirmed our role incongruency prediction using an elementary school teaching task in which participants wrote a lesson plan, judged the emotions of children, and created a bulletin board. Study 3 replicated and extended these results to a medical role-playing task that was framed as a 'nursing' or a 'doctor' task. Like Study 2, results showed reduced motivation for men when engaging in a feminine (but not masculine) framed task under gay salience conditions. Women were relatively unaffected by the gender and sexuality manipulations. Taken together, results illustrate a range of motivational and performance consequences for men who engage in role incongruent tasks.

466,"Attachment, authenticity, and honesty: Dispositional and experimentally induced security can reduce self- and other-deception","Attachment security is hypothesized to promote authenticity and sincerity, or honesty, whereas insecurity is hypothesized to increase various forms of inauthenticity and dishonesty. The authors tested these ideas in 8 studies of dispositional and situational attachment insecurities and their influence on inauthenticity and dishonesty. The first 4 studies showed that authenticity is related to scoring low on the 2 dimensions of dispositional attachment insecurity—anxiety and avoidance—and that these 2 dimensions are associated with different aspects of inauthenticity. The first set of studies also showed that conscious and unconscious security priming increased state authenticity (compared with neutral or insecurity priming). The last 4 studies showed that attachment insecurity is related to dishonesty (lying and cheating) and that security priming reduces the tendency to lie or cheat and does so more effectively than positive mood priming. Implications for understanding the role of authenticity and inauthenticity in various relationship contexts are discussed.

467,Cultural cognition and public policy: The case of outpatient commitment laws,"What explains controversy over outpatient commitment laws ({OCLs}), which authorize courts to order persons with mental illness to accept outpatient treatment? We hypothesized that attitudes toward {OCLs} reflect 'cultural cognition' ({DiMaggio}, P. Annl Rev Sociol 23:263–287, 1997), which motivates individuals to conform their beliefs about policy-relevant facts to their cultural values. In a study involving a diverse sample of Americans (N = 1,496), we found that individuals who are hierarchical and communitarian tend to support {OCLs}, while those who are egalitarian and individualistic tend to oppose them. These relationships, moreover, fit the cultural cognition hypothesis: that is, rather than directly influencing {OCL} support, cultural values, mediated by affect, shaped individuals’ perceptions of how effectively {OCLs} promote public health and safety. We discuss the implications for informed public deliberation over {OCLs}.

468,"I am not an animal: Mortality salience, disgust, and the denial of human creatureliness","The present research investigated the need to distinguish humans from animals and tested the hypothesis derived from terror management theory that this need stems in part from existential mortality concerns. Specifically, the authors suggest that being an animal is threatening because it reminds people of their vulnerability to death; therefore, reminding people of their mortality was hypothesized to increase the need to distance from animals. In support, Study 1 revealed that reminders of death led to an increased emotional reaction of disgust to body products and animals. Study 2 showed that compared to a control condition, mortality salience led to greater preference for an essay describing people as distinct from animals; and within the mortality salient condition but not the control condition, the essay emphasizing differences from other animals was preferred to the essay emphasizing similarities. The implications of these results for understanding why humans are so invested in beautifying their bodies and denying creaturely aspects of themselves are discussed.

469,Catching the liar as a matter of justice: Effects of belief in a just world on deception detection accuracy and the moderating role of mortality salience,"Belief in a just world has been linked to high interpersonal trust and less suspicion of deception. We therefore predicted people with a strong dispositional belief in a just world to have low motivation to accurately detect deception. Accordingly, we hypothesized such a belief to be negatively related to accuracy in deception detection. Furthermore, research on Terror Management Theory has indicated that culturally shared values, such as justice, become more important after mortality salience. Thus, we assumed engaging in justice concerns after a death threat is especially relevant for people with a strong belief in a just world, and further, that accurate deception detection is a matter of justice. Based on this reasoning, we expected people with a strong belief in a just world to have an increased motivation to accurately detect deception after mortality salience. Consequently, we hypothesized dispositional differences in belief in a just world to be unrelated to accuracy in deception detection after mortality salience. In line with these predictions, our study revealed that participants with a strong (vs. weak) belief in a just world were worse in deception detection unless they had first been reminded of their mortality.

470,Age-related differences in altruism across adulthood: Making personal financial gain versus contributing to the public good,"Four studies utilizing different methodological approaches investigated adult age-related differences in altruism (i.e., contributions to the public good) and the self-centered value of increasing personal wealth. In Study 1, data from the World Values Survey (World Values Survey Association, 2009) provided 1st evidence of a negative association between age and the self-reported wish to be rich. Ecological concerns, a form of contributing to the public good, were positively related to age. Study 2 investigated whether these values are expressed behaviorally when participants solved a complex problem that allowed striving for monetary gains or contributing to a public good. Confirming hypotheses, young adults’ strategies were consistent with the aim of optimizing personal financial gain, and older adults’ strategies with the aim to contribute to the public good. Studies 3 and 4 showed that older adults were more likely than younger and middle-aged adults to donate money to a good cause than to keep it for themselves. Study 4 manipulated participants’ future time perspective as a factor potentially contributing to age-related differences. Partly confirming hypotheses, a longer time perspective reduced donations by older adults, but a shorter time perspective did not increase donations by younger adults. These studies suggest that older adults not only report valuing contributions to the public good more highly but also are more likely to behave altruistically than younger adults. All studies used cross-sectional designs that prevent a strict test of developmental trajectories but rather provide age-related differences at 1 point in time, representing a 1st step in investigating adult age-related differences in altruism.

471,Toward understanding why fairness matters: The influence of mortality salience on reactions to procedural fairness,"This article focuses on the question of why fairness matters to people. On the basis of fairness heuristic theory, the authors argue that people especially need fairness when they are uncertain about things that are important to them. Following terror management theory, the authors focus on a basic kind of human uncertainty: fear of death. Integrating these two theoretical frameworks, it is proposed that thinking about their mortality should make fairness a more important issue to people. The findings of three experiments support the authors' line of reasoning: Asking participants to think about their mortality led to stronger fair process effects (positive effects of perceived procedural fairness on subsequent reactions) than not asking them to think about mortality. It is argued that these findings suggest that fairness especially matters to people when they are uncertain about fundamental aspects of human life such as human mortality.

472,Mortality salience and age effects on charitable donations,"Research suggests that people are typically more generous in later life. Terror management theory offers one explanation for this pattern. The theory suggests that humans’ innate desire to survive results in strong reactions to increased awareness of mortality, thereby affecting behaviors. Older adults’ increasing proximity to life’s end has been associated with greater generative concern, as a means of caring for future generations and ensuring symbolic immortality. This experimental study evaluated the effects of age and mortality salience on charitable giving. Age and mortality salience interacted to affect donations overall and specifically for in-group and out-group donations. Compared with respective age-based control groups, findings indicate that mortality salience primes led young adults to donate less overall to the in-group, and older adults to donate more overall and more to the out-group. Middle-aged adults’ donations did not vary according to priming condition. Results suggest that contemplation of mortality differentially affects charitable donations of young and older adults.

473,Being modest makes you feel bad: Effects of the modesty norm and mortality salience on self‐esteem in a collectivistic culture,"Terror management research shows that existential terror motivates people to live up to social norms. According to terror management theory ({TMT}), people can achieve a sense of self‐worth through compliance with social norms. However, this has not yet been empirically tested. Modesty has long been known as an important social norm in Eastern cultures, such as China, Japan, and Korea. The current research examined whether conforming to the modesty norm in response to reminders of death concerns increases self‐esteem for Chinese. In Study 1, following the modesty norm (i.e., explicit self‐effacement) led to decreased implicit self‐esteem, however, this was only the case if mortality was salient. In Study 2, violating the modesty norm (i.e., explicit self‐enhancement) increased implicit self‐esteem – however – again, this was only the case when mortality was salient. These findings indicate that self‐esteem cannot be maintained through compliance with the modesty norm. Implications of this research for understanding the interplay between self‐esteem and social norms in terror management processes are discussed.

As important as this dimension is, there are many other forms of culture with many dimensions of cultural variability. Selecting from among the many understudied cultures in psychology, the author considers three kinds of cultures: religion, socioeconomic status, and region within a country. These cultures vary in a number of psychologically interesting ways. By studying more types of culture, psychologists stand to enrich how they define culture, how they think about universality and cultural specificity, their views of multiculturalism, how they do research on culture, and what dimensions of culture they study. Broadening the study of culture will have far-reaching implications for clinical issues, intergroup relations, and applied domains.

This study analyses the stereotypes of 5 religious groups (Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs) among a sample of undergraduate students (N = 152) in Canada. It also examines the relationship between intergroup contact, knowledge, and attitudes toward these religious groups. Open-ended response methodology was used to elicit participants’ perceptions of the characteristics of target religious groups as well as the emotions they felt toward these groups. Participants also completed attitude thermometers, Attitude Toward Religious Group ({ATRG}) Scales, and items assessing knowledge about target groups as well as the extent of contact with the groups. Results suggest that, overall, more positive than negative characteristics were ascribed to the groups. Similarly, more positive or neutral emotions than negative emotions were expressed toward the groups. Consistent with our first hypothesis, knowledge and contact score positively predicted {ATRG} scores. Our second hypothesis that Muslims would be evaluated least favourably among the 5 groups was also supported. Our results indicate that the contact hypothesis can be extended to religious groups as contact and information about the target groups predicted positive attitudes toward them.

Shooter bias, perceived threat, and intergroup processes","This research examines if aggressive responses through a shooter bias are systematically generated by priming outgroups or if a threat stereotypically associated with the primed outgroup is required. First, a pilot study identified outgroups stereotypically associated and not associated with threat. Afterwards, the main study included a manipulation of target group accessibility—ingroup versus nonthreatening outgroup versus threatening outgroup. Following exposure to primes of the group categories, the participants in all conditions played a shooter game in which the targets were males and females with ambiguous ethnicity and religion. Results demonstrated that while only priming of an outgroup stereotypically associated with threat elicits aggressive responses, priming of both nonthreatening and threatening outgroups leads to an increase in the ability to distinguish between stimuli compared to ingroup priming. These effects are discussed in terms of priming effects, dimensions of threat, and possible interpretations of this ability increase.

479,"Final decentrations: Personal goals, rationality perspectives, and the awareness of life’s finitude","We submit that with advancing age and the age-inherent shrinking of life-time reserves, intrinsic-valuerational, that is, ego-transcending goals tend to gain priority over extrinsic-instrumental goals that aim at future personal benefits. This proposition is investigated in four studies that combine questionnaire assessments and experimental analyses. In Study 1, age differences in extrinsic-instrumental and intrinsic-valuerational orientations are analyzed in a cross-sectional study involving 359 participants in the age range from 35 to 84 years. In Study 2, we ask whether the postulated shift in goal orientations could be simulated by inducing a cognitive focus on themes of death and dying (N = 371). Studies 3 and 4 (Ns = 50 and 86) serve to replicate and expand the findings with an experimental setup, paying particular attention to the moderating role of accommodative flexibility and to implicit preferences. Taken together, the results of this research substantiate the assumption that the experience of narrowing life-time reserves activates accommodative processes that enhance the disengagement from egocentric-individualistic concerns.

480,Collective nostalgia: A group-level emotion that confers unique benefits on the group,"This research established collective nostalgia as a group-level emotion and ascertained the benefits it confers on the group. In Study 1, participants who reflected on a nostalgic event they had experienced together with ingroup members (collective nostalgia) evaluated the ingroup more positively and reported stronger intentions to approach (and not avoid) ingroup members than those who recalled a nostalgic event they had experienced individually (personal nostalgia), those who reflected on a lucky event they had experienced together with ingroup members (collective positive), and those who did not recall an event (no recall). In Study 2, collective (vs. personal) nostalgia strengthened behavioral intentions to support the ingroup more so than did recalling an ordinary collective (vs. personal) event. Increased collective self-esteem mediated this effect. In Study 3, collective nostalgia (compared with recall of an ordinary collective event) led participants to sacrifice money in order to punish a transgression perpetrated against an ingroup member. This effect of collective nostalgia was more pronounced when social identification was high (compared with low). Finally, in Study 4, collective nostalgia converged toward the group average (i.e., was socially shared) when participants thought of themselves in terms of their group membership. The findings underscore the viability of studying nostalgia at multiple levels of analysis and highlight the significance of collective nostalgia for understanding group-level attitudes, global action tendencies, specific behavioral intentions, and behavior.

484,Perceived primal threat of mental illness and recovery: The mediating role of self-stigma and self-empowerment,"Although people in recovery from mental illness can continue to live a personally meaningful life despite their mental illness, their perception of mental illness as being a threat to their basic needs may influence the way they view themselves as a person with mental illness and their sense of mastery over their condition. The present study explored the effects of perceived primal threat on the recovery of people with mental illness, considering the mediating roles of self-stigma and self-empowerment. Latent variable structural equation modeling was conducted among 376 individuals with mental illness in Hong Kong. The model had excellent fit to the data (χ2 = 123.96, df = 60, χ2/df = 2.07, comparative fit index [{CFI}] = .98, Tucker–Lewis index [{TLI}] = .97, root mean square error of approximation [{RMSEA}] = .05, standardized root mean squared residual [{SRMR}] = .04). The influence of perceived primal threat on recovery was mediated by self-stigma and self-empowerment. Specifically, perceived primal threat was associated positively with self-stigma, which was negatively related to recovery; in contrast, it was negatively related to self-empowerment, which was positively related to recovery. This study adds to the understanding of the mechanism underlying the influence of perceived primal threat on recovery and suggests that perceived primal threat should be considered in the recovery process among people with mental illness.

485,Genetic and environmental sources of individual differences in views on aging,"Views on aging are central psychosocial variables in the aging process, but knowledge about their determinants is still fragmental. Thus, the authors investigated the degree to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual differences in various domains of views on aging (wisdom, work, fitness, and family), and whether these variance components vary across ages. They analyzed data from 350 monozygotic and 322 dizygotic twin pairs from the Midlife Development in the U.S. ({MIDUS}) study, aged 25–74. Individual differences in views on aging were mainly due to individual-specific environmental and genetic effects. However, depending on the domain, genetic and environmental contributions to the variance differed. Furthermore, for some domains, variability was larger for older participants; this was attributable to increases in environmental components. This study extends research on genetic and environmental sources of psychosocial variables and stimulates future studies investigating the etiology of views on aging across the life span.

486,Consumer culture as worldview defense: A terror management perspective - Handbook of terror management theory.,"According to terror management theory ({TMT}), the unique human capacity to reflect upon their own mortality creates an existential dilemma: human beings' awareness that their own death is inevitable conflicts with their strong striving for self-preservation. This chapter zooms in on the consumer domains in which a fear of death appears particularly relevant and that has captured most empirical attention. It starts out by exploring a fundamental question regarding the relationship between existential concerns, the symbolic value of money and greed. The chapter elaborates on the different ways in which consumption could suppress a fear of death, by looking at specific qualities of products and brands, and the cultural worldviews they represent, such as nationalism or status. It discusses research that has studied key moderators of consumer responses, and examines the different contexts that could induce fear-related consumer responses, ranging from 'accidental' forms of influence such as television programs to the intentional use of death reminders in advertising contexts.

487,Existential threat and compliance with pro-environmental norms,"Recent research on the effects of personal threat suggests that perceived threat might enhance pro-environmental behavior when pro-environmental norms are in focus. In three experiments we found support for the latter assumption, showing that mortality salience and salience of pro-environmental norms interacted in predicting pro-environmental attitudes and information search (Study 1), sustainable behavior in a forest management game (Study 2), as well as pro-environmental intentions and behavior (Study 3). Specifically, mortality salience increased pro-environmental conduct only when pro-environmental norms were salient. Moreover, norm salience only had an effect on pro-environmental attitudes and behavior when the threat of personal mortality was salient. We discuss the implications of these results for both terror management theory and the promotion of pro-environmental behaviors.

488,"Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation","People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cultures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of individuals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motivation; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed.

489,Experimental reductions of delay discounting and impulsive choice: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Many behaviors posing significant risks to public health are characterized by repeated decisions to forego better long-term outcomes in the face of immediate temptations. Steeply discounting the value of delayed outcomes often underlies a pattern of impulsive choice. Steep delay discounting is correlated with addictions (e.g., substance abuse, obesity) and behaviors such as seatbelt use and risky sexual activity. As evidence accumulates suggesting steep delay discounting plays a causal role in these maladaptive behaviors, researchers have begun testing methods for reducing discounting. In this first systematic and comprehensive review of this literature, the findings of 92 articles employing different methodologies to reduce discounting are evaluated narratively and meta-analytically. Although most of the methods reviewed produced significant reductions in discounting, they varied in effect sizes. Most methods were ideal for influencing one-off choices (e.g., framing and priming manipulations), although other successful manipulations, such as episodic future thinking, could be incorporated into existing therapies designed to produce longer-lasting changes in decision-making. The largest and longest-lasting effects were produced by learning-based manipulations, although translational research is needed to determine the generality and clinical utility of these methods. Methodological shortcomings in the existing literature and suggestions for ameliorating these issues are discussed. This review reveals a variety of methods with translational potential, which, through continued refinement, may prove effective in reducing impulsive choice and its associated maladaptive decisions that negatively impact quality of life.

490,Why we like to watch sad films The pleasure of being moved in aesthetic experiences,"This article investigates an age-old, puzzling question: how can a negatively valenced emotion such as sadness go together with aesthetic liking and even pleasure? We propose that an answer to this question must take into account the feeling of being moved, a complex emotional state that plays a major role in the history of poetics and aesthetics and has recently begun to attract interest in psychological research. We conducted a study in an actual cinema using film clips as sadness-eliciting stimuli. In total, 76 participants watched 38 clips that presented variations of the same sad scenario: a character or a group of characters learns about the death of a close person. The study revealed a highly significant positive correlation between sadness and enjoyment. However, this correlation was almost fully mediated by the feeling of being moved. Hence sadness primarily functions as a contributor to and intensifier of the emotional state of being moved. Furthermore, the study revealed that being moved is a positive term in two senses. First, it refers to an overall positive feeling. Second, it indicates a positive value judgment regarding the power of a film to elicit such feelings. Therefore, we conclude that it is the overall positive feeling of being moved itself that recipients of sad films and other forms of art enjoy—we simply like to be moved. Taken together, our findings are significant for investigations of the so-called ‘sad-film paradox’ and the aesthetic pleasure associated with negative emotions more generally.

491,The new cosmopolitans: Challenges and discontents,"This paper investigates some psychodynamic aspects of a new global class: New Cosmopolitans work in highly creative professions that are organized in global networks run in English. Their identities are more influenced by these networks than by ethnic, national, and religious upbringing, and their frame of reference is global. Clinical, sociological, and economic data suggest that it is more difficult for New Cosmopolitans to maintain stable self-esteem, because their frame of reference is global. They suffer more from the existential fear of insignificance associated with mortality, and their existential safety is lowered because they are less rooted in ethnic and national structures. Nevertheless, New Cosmopolitans are a very influential group because of their influence in media, academia, and high-tech, and it is therefore a valuable project to understand their psychodynamic and to investigate implications of their lifestyle and the necessity of using Skype to maintain therapeutic continuity with them.

492,"Suppression, accessibility of death-related thoughts, and cultural worldview defense: Exploring the psychodynamics of terror management","Previous research has shown that after a mortality salience ({MS}) treatment, death thought accessibility and worldview defense are initially low and then increase after a delay, suggesting that a person's initial response to conscious thoughts of mortality is to actively suppress death thoughts. If so, then high cognitive load, by disrupting suppression efforts, should lead to immediate increases in death thought accessibility and cultural worldview defense. Studies 1 and 2 supported this reasoning. Specifically, Study 1 replicated the delayed increase in death accessibility after {MS} among low cognitive load participants but showed a reversed pattern among participants under high cognitive load. Study 2 showed that, unlike low cognitive load participants, high cognitive load participants exhibited immediate increases in pro-American bias after {MS}. Study 3 demonstrated that worldview defense in response to {MS} reduces the delayed increase in death accessibility. Implications of these findings for understanding both terror management processes and psychological defense in general are discussed.

493,Concern over the misidentification of sexual orientation: Social contagion and the avoidance of sexual minorities,"Membership in a valued group can provide an individual with a variety of benefits. As a result, people should be motivated to avoid being misidentified as a member of an outgroup, particularly a stigmatized outgroup. We argue that when group membership is not readily identifiable, concern over potentially being mistaken for a member of the outgroup (i.e., social contagion concerns) can be potent and can lead to avoidance of the outgroup. The current work shows that after controlling for negative attitudes toward homosexuality, social contagion concerns independently predict anxiety and avoidance in response to imagined, anticipated, and actual contact with a lesbian or gay individual. Results from these studies suggest that concern over misclassification of sexual orientation is an important and unique predictor of responses to contact with lesbian and gay people. Implications for intergroup contact and responses to other stigmatized groups are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2018 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Buck, David M. and Plant, E.

495,Models of the self: Self-construals and gender,"The authors first describe individual differences in the structure of the self. In the independent self-construal, representations of others are separate from the self. In the interdependent self-construal, others are considered part of the self (H. Markus \& S. Kitayama, 1991). In general, men in the United States are thought to construct and maintain an independent self-construal, whereas women are thought to construct and maintain an interdependent self-construal. The authors review the psychological literature to demonstrate that many gender differences in cognition, motivation, emotion, and social behavior may be explained in terms of men's and women's different self-construals. Recognition of the interdependent self-construal as a possible alternative conception of the self may stimulate new investigations into the ways the self influences a person's thinking, feeling, and behaving.

Veterans may feel that no one can understand them and thus impact their relationships. The current study aims to shed light on the role that posttraumatic stress symptoms ({PTSS}), loneliness, and attachment orientations may play in marital adjustment among combat veterans. Method: Participants were 504 veterans who served in the Lebanon War in 1982. Results: Analysis revealed that higher {PTSS} levels were related to lower marital adjustment and that the indirect path of this relation through loneliness was significant. Furthermore, attachment orientations moderated the direct link between {PTSS} and marital adjustment, but failed to moderate the indirect effect through loneliness. Conclusions: A sense of isolation should be addressed in therapy, as well as the interpersonal expectations of the veteran.

497,The Scrooge effect revisited: Mortality salience increases the satisfaction derived from prosocial behavior,"According to terror management theory, people deal with the potential for anxiety that results from the knowledge of the inevitability of death by holding on to sources of value that exist within their cultural worldview. Acting prosocially is one such source of value, and previous research suggests that reminders of mortality increase the desire for prosociality. In three studies, we tested the hypothesis that mortality reminders would lead to more generous allocation of financial resources and to more satisfaction derived from acting generously. Using the dictator game (Study 1), the ultimatum game (Study 2), and a quasi-naturalistic giving situation (Study 3) we showed that participants reminded of their mortality were not only more generous but also more satisfied the more money they donated. Moreover, Study 3 demonstrated that people reminded of their mortality derived higher satisfaction from prosocial behavior and such behavior was associated with better suppression of death-related thoughts. We conclude that acting prosocially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety and in turn produces psychological satisfaction.

498,Climate change information's impact on death-thought accessibility and global climate change belief,"Global climate change is perhaps the greatest current existential threat to life on this planet. Despite the overwhelming scientific consensus for the existence of human-made global climate change, climate change skepticism continues to be a significant obstacle. The purpose of this experimental online study was to address research questions concerning the effect of climate change information on death-thought accessibility ({DTA}) and belief in global climate change and to investigate whether a relationship exists between {DTA} and belief certainty in global climate change. Terror management theory was the theoretical foundation for the study. The study sample consisted of 104 participants randomly assigned to two experimental groups and a control group. Group 1 read an essay about the environmental effects of climate change, Group 2 read an essay on the human causes of climate change, and Group 3 (control) read information about rainy weather. A 25-item word completion task was used to measure {DTA} and a 17-item Likert scale (Whitmarsh Skepticism Scale) measured belief certainty in global climate change. An {ANOVA} with planned contrasts and an {ANCOVA} were performed with nonsignificant results, indicating that climate change information alone does not necessarily increase {DTA} or belief certainty in global climate change, nor does it indicate a relationship between the 2 variables. The findings indicate that more than educational information on climate change may be needed to effect positive social change regarding the issue of global climate change.

499,Multicultural experiences reduce intergroup bias through epistemic unfreezing,"In 6 studies, we systematically explored for the 1st time the ameliorative effects of multicultural experience on intergroup bias and investigated the role of epistemic unfreezing as the motivational mechanism underlying these effects. We found that multicultural exposure led to a reduction in stereotype endorsement (Studies 1, 4, and 6), symbolic racism (Study 5), and discriminatory hiring decisions (Study 2). We further demonstrated that experimental exposure to multicultural experience caused a reduction in need for cognitive closure ({NFCC}; Studies 3 and 6) and that the ameliorative effects of multiculturalism experience on intergroup bias were fully mediated by lower levels of {NFCC} (Studies 4, 5, and 6). The beneficial effects of multiculturalism were found regardless of the targeted stereotype group (African Americans, Ethiopians, homosexuals, and native Israelis), regardless of whether multicultural experience was measured or manipulated, and regardless of the population sampled (Caucasian Americans or native Israelis), demonstrating the robustness of this phenomenon. Overall, these results demonstrate that multicultural experience plays a critical role in increasing social tolerance through its relationship to motivated cognitive processes.

500,Evidence for terror management theory {II}: The effects of mortality salience on reactions to those who threaten or bolster the cultural worldview,"Three experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis, derived from terror management theory, that reminding people of their mortality increases attraction to those who consensually validate their beliefs and decreases attraction to those who threaten their beliefs. In Study 1, subjects with a Christian religious background were asked to form impressions of Christian and Jewish target persons. Before doing so, mortality was made salient to half of the subjects. In support of predictions, mortality salience led to more positive evaluations of the in-group member (the Christian) and more negative evaluations of the out-group member (the Jew). In Study 2, mortality salience led to especially negative evaluations of an attitudinally dissimilar other, but only among subjects high in authoritarianism. In Study 3, mortality salience led to especially positive reactions to someone who directly praised subjects' cultural worldviews and especially negative reactions to someone who criticized them. The implications of these findings for understanding in-group favoritism, prejudice, and intolerance of deviance are discussed.

The current studies further explored the existential function of nostalgia by testing the prediction that nostalgia decreases ideologically extreme defenses against existential threat (i.e., self-sacrifice on behalf of one’s nation or religion). Results supported this hypothesis. In Study 1, mortality salience increased willingness to engage in nationalistic self-sacrifice for those low, but not high, in trait nostalgia. In Study 2, manipulated nostalgia mitigated the relationship between death-thought accessibility and willingness to engage in religious self-sacrifice.

502,"Attachment, Caregiving, and Altruism: Boosting Attachment Security Increases Compassion and Helping","Recent studies based on J. Bowlby's (1969/1982) attachment theory reveal that both dispositional and experimentally enhanced attachment security facilitate cognitive openness and empathy, strengthen self-transcendent values, and foster tolerance of out-group members. Moreover, dispositional attachment security is associated with volunteering to help others in everyday life and to unselfish motives for volunteering. The present article reports 5 experiments, replicated in 2 countries (Israel and the United States), testing the hypothesis that increases in security (accomplished through both implicit and explicit priming techniques) foster compassion and altruistic behavior. The hypothesized effects were consistently obtained, and various alternative explanations were explored and ruled out. Dispositional attachment-related anxiety and avoidance adversely influenced compassion, personal distress, and altruistic behavior in theoretically predictable ways. As expected, attachment security provides a foundation for care-oriented feelings and caregiving behaviors, whereas various forms of insecurity suppress or interfere with compassionate caregiving.

Mortality salience, death-thought accessibility, and self-forgiveness","Terror management theory claims the quintessential indicator of cultural adherence is human self-esteem, and self-esteem is vital to suppressing death-thoughts into the unconscious to buffer against existential fear. Guilt—an emotional response to cultural-based rule violations—should therefore be an important motivation for self-forgiveness. In four studies, mortality salience, death-thought accessibility, and self-forgiveness were negligibly related, and offense severity, conciliatory behaviors, perceived forgiveness, and effort provided negligible moderation. In Study 1, results did not support the initial interactional-moderated-mediation model. In three follow-up studies, experimental-causal-chain analyses had unsupportive findings.

504,Attachment theory and intergroup bias: Evidence that priming the secure base schema attenuates negative reactions to out-groups,"Five studies examined the effects of priming the secure base schema on intergroup bias. In addition, Studies 1–2 examined the effects of dispositional attachment style, Studies 2–5 examined a mood interpretation, Study 3 examined the mediating role of threat appraisal, and Studies 4–5 examined the effects of secure base priming while inducing a threat to self-esteem or cultural worldview. Secure base priming led to less negative evaluative reactions toward out-groups than positive affect and neutral control conditions. In addition, whereas the effects of secure base priming did not depend on attachment style and were not explained by mood induction, they were mediated by threat appraisal and occurred even when self-esteem or cultural worldview was threatened. The discussion emphasizes the relevance of attachment theory for understanding intergroup attitudes.

Design: The study took the form of a 2 (death vs. uncertainty reminder) × 3 (Monday vs. Wednesday vs. Friday) between‐subjects laboratory‐based quasi‐experimental design. Methods: A total of 210 participants (age: M = 21.92 years, {SD} = 5.33; 103 males and 107 females) recruited from a {UK} university answered either an open‐ended question to prime mortality or uncertainty cognition on either a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. As part of an ostensible taste test, they then consumed as much or as little of a purportedly alcoholic drink as they desired. Results: Death reminders (vs. control topic) were found to result in more consumption of the beverage on a Friday, less consumption on a Monday, and no difference in consumption on a Wednesday. Conclusions: Findings point to the flexible, time‐contingent nature of culture‐oriented defences against mortality concerns with potential implications for the efficacy of alcohol health warnings featuring mortality‐related stimuli.

Prior data were reanalyzed, revealing ambiguous results, so further experiments were conducted. In Study 1 (n = 382), atheists were randomly assigned to a supernatural afterlife-confirmed (vs. afterlife-disconfirmed) prime, an {MS} (vs. control topic) prime, and then given an opportunity to engage in secular worldview defense. In Study 2 (n = 360), atheists were randomly assigned to supernatural (afterlife) versus natural (medical indefinite life extension; {MILE}) immortality prime, an {MS} (vs. control topic) prime, and then given an opportunity to engage in secular worldview defense. Atheists managing death awareness increased worldview defense in the supernatural/afterlife conditions but that effect was eliminated in the {MILE} condition. These findings are consistent with the terror management theory perspective on worldview defense. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

Factor structure and measurement invariance were examined using confirmatory factor analyses ({CFAs}). Concurrent validity was tested by correlating the {RSE} with a set of previously developed measures of psychological well-being and social support. The data supported a two-factor family-friend model for both {HIV}-positive and {HIV}-negative samples. Multiple-group tests showed measurement invariance across two samples. Concurrent validity was confirmed with correlations in the expected direction between the {RSE} and psychological well-being and social support.

In Study 1, writing about death versus a control topic increased worldview defense among participants low in implicit self-esteem but not among those high in implicit self-esteem. In Study 2, a manipulation to boost implicit self-esteem reduced the effect of mortality salience on worldview defense. In Study 3, mortality salience increased the endorsement of positive personality descriptions but only among participants with the combination of low implicit and high explicit self-esteem. These findings indicate that high implicit self-esteem confers resilience against the psychological threat of death, and therefore the findings provide direct support for a fundamental tenet of terror management theory regarding the anxiety-buffering role of self-esteem.

509,Power and death: Mortality salience increases power seeking while feeling powerful reduces death anxiety,"According to Terror Management Theory, people respond to reminders of mortality by seeking psychological security and bolstering their self-esteem. Because previous research suggests that having power can provide individuals a sense of security and self-worth, we hypothesize that mortality salience leads to an increased motivation to acquire power, especially among men. Study 1 found that men (but not women) who wrote about their death reported more interest in acquiring power. Study 2A and Study 2B demonstrated that when primed with reminders of death, men (but not women) reported behaving more dominantly during the subsequent week, while both men and women reported behaving more prosocially during that week. Thus, mortality salience prompts people to respond in ways that help them manage their death anxiety but in ways consistent with normative gender expectations. Furthermore, Studies 3–5 showed that feeling powerful reduces anxiety when mortality is salient. Specifically, we found that when primed to feel more powerful, both men and women experienced less mortality anxiety.

510,Men’s perceived partner commitment and mate guarding: The moderating role of partner’s hormonal contraceptive use,"Male jealousy is an adaptive interpersonal process that functions to maintain relationships by reducing the likelihood of partner sexual infidelity. Ancestral men would have been most reproductively successful to the extent that they responded to signs of low partner commitment with increased jealousy and mate guarding. The current research showed that, indeed, newlywed husbands who perceived relatively low commitment in their new wives displayed relatively high levels of mate guarding. However, this relationship was moderated by wives’ use of hormonal contraceptives ({HCs}). {HCs} can unconsciously reduce women’s sexual signaling behaviors and, therefore, may eliminate the extra-pair sexual signaling likely to promote male mate guarding. Consistent with predictions, among husbands with wives not using {HCs}, relatively low levels of perceived partner commitment were associated with relatively high levels of husbands’ mate guarding. Among husbands with wives using {HCs}, in contrast, husbands’ perceived partner commitment was unassociated with husbands’ mate guarding. This finding joins others in suggesting that the use of {HCs}, often used in the context of long-term committed relationships, can unknowingly interrupt evolved relationship processes.

In the present research the authors question the omnipresence of ingroup bias under threat and test the assumptions that these effects depend on the content of social identity and group norm salient in a situation. In the first two studies cross-categorization and recategorization manipulations eliminated and even reversed mortality salience effects on bias in relations between English and Scottish students (Study 1) as well as English and French people (Study 2). In the third study the specific normative content of a given social identity (collectivism vs. individualism) was shown to moderate mortality salience effects on ingroup bias.

512,"Pushing up daisies: Goal orientations, death awareness, and satisfaction with life","The present research built on terror management theory and self-determination theory to test whether heightened death awareness might undermine satisfaction with life among people oriented toward extrinsic goals (wealth, fame, attractiveness), yet lead people with stronger intrinsic goal orientations (personal growth, warm social connections) to reflect on life with greater satisfaction. In Study 1 (n = 263), participants indicated their relative intrinsic (vs. extrinsic) goal orientation ({RIGO}), were randomly assigned to either an {MS} or uncertainty salience condition, and rated their satisfaction with life. Study 2 (n = 389) was a preregistered follow-up, with the additional measurement of self-esteem and the {MS} comparison condition changed from uncertainty salience to a more neutral condition. Both studies found that: at low {RIGO}, {MS} (vs. comparison condition) decreased satisfaction with life; however, at high {RIGO}, {MS} increased satisfaction with life. Study 2 further found that the moderating role of {RIGO} was not due to its association with self-esteem, but also failed to replicate prior evidence suggesting self-esteem moderates the effect of {MS} on satisfaction with life. These findings inform the impact of death awareness on well-being, highlighting the role of value orientations in whether death awareness is taken as an unpleasant existential stressor or an occasion to reflect on life with greater satisfaction.

513,The psychological advantage of unfalsifiability: The appeal of untestable religious and political ideologies,"We propose that people may gain certain 'offensive' and 'defensive' advantages for their cherished belief systems (e.g., religious and political views) by including aspects of unfalsifiability in those belief systems, such that some aspects of the beliefs cannot be tested empirically and conclusively refuted. This may seem peculiar, irrational, or at least undesirable to many people because it is assumed that the primary purpose of a belief is to know objective truth. However, past research suggests that accuracy is only one psychological motivation among many, and falsifiability or testability may be less important when the purpose of a belief serves other psychological motives (e.g., to maintain one’s worldviews, serve an identity). In Experiments 1 and 2 we demonstrate the 'offensive' function of unfalsifiability: that it allows religious adherents to hold their beliefs with more conviction and political partisans to polarize and criticize their opponents more extremely. Next we demonstrate unfalsifiability’s 'defensive' function: When facts threaten their worldviews, religious participants frame specific reasons for their beliefs in more unfalsifiable terms (Experiment 3) and political partisans construe political issues as more unfalsifiable ('moral opinion') instead of falsifiable ('a matter of facts'; Experiment 4). We conclude by discussing how in a world where beliefs and ideas are becoming more easily testable by data, unfalsifiability might be an attractive aspect to include in one’s belief systems, and how unfalsifiability may contribute to polarization, intractability, and the marginalization of science in public discourse.

514,Bridging the partisan divide: Self-affirmation reduces ideological closed-mindedness and inflexibility in negotiation,"Three studies link resistance to probative information and intransigence in negotiation to concerns of identity maintenance. Each shows that affirmations of personal integrity (vs. nonaffirmation or threat) can reduce resistance and intransigence but that this effect occurs only when individuals' partisan identity and/or identity-related convictions are made salient. Affirmation made participants' assessment of a report critical of U.S. foreign policy less dependent on their political views, but only when the identity relevance of the issue rather than the goal of rationality was salient (Study 1). Affirmation increased concession making in a negotiation over abortion policy, but again this effect was moderated by identity salience (Studies 2 and 3).

515,A critique of the 'theistic psychology' movement as exemplified in Bartz's (2009) 'Theistic Existential Psychotherapy',"From the perspectives of existential philosophy, existential psychotherapy, philosophy of science, and theology, we critique Bartz's (2009) 'Theistic Existential Psychotherapy' as another example of the argumentation of the 'theistic psychology' movement. Twenty-one points highlight troubling inadequacies. Introductory and concluding paragraphs provide the broader context of this movement and focus the chief concern: Amidst current epistemological and philosophy-of-science uncertainty, the concerted effort to validate other-worldly religious beliefs as scientific principles within the empirical field of psychology of religion.

516,Adaptive memory: The mnemonic power of survival-based generation,"Four experiments investigated the mnemonic effects of generating survival situations. People were given target words and asked to generate survival situations involving that stimulus (e.g., {DOOR}: 'I’m in a house that’s on fire, and I can escape through the door'). No constraints were placed on the generation process, other than that it must be survival-related and refer to the target stimulus. Following a series of these generation trials people were given a surprise retention test for the target words. Across four experiments the survival generation task produced significantly better retention than several deep processing controls including: (a) a pleasantness-rating task, (b) an autobiographical retrieval task, and (c) a task that required people to generate unusual uses for the target items. These results demonstrate the power of survival processing in a new way and provide diagnostic information about the proximate mechanisms that may underlie survival processing advantages. They also extend the generality of survival processing beyond the standard relevance-rating procedure that has been used in virtually all prior research.

Two experiments conducted among survivors of the 2005 Zarand earthquake in Iran supported four hypotheses derived from {ABDT}: (1) dissociation predicts atypical responses to death- and trauma-related thoughts, (2) dissociation predicts stronger affective responses to death- and trauma-related thoughts, (3) {PTSD} symptom severity 2 years after the event is associated with continued disruption of anxiety-buffer responses, (4) the relationship between dissociation 1 month posttrauma and posttraumatic symptoms 2 years later is mediated by disrupted anxiety-buffering functioning. The role of anxiety-buffer disruption in both clinically significant and seemingly benign but socially problematic responses to traumatic events was discussed.

518,Death anxiety and well-being; coping with life-threatening events,"Research was conducted among people who have experienced trauma to see the influence of coping factors on death anxiety, {PTSD}, and psychiatric comorbidity. The intent was to consider the role of death anxiety in relationship to {PTSD} and mental health among people who have experienced a life-threatening event. It examined both self-efficacy and religious coping as possible factors of death anxiety resilience in relation to trauma. This study was conducted using undergraduate university students in Lithuania. The study (N = 104) did not find evidence to support the significance of religious coping as important factor; however, self-efficacy emerged as significantly related to psychiatric comorbidity and death anxiety. However the results found that self-efficacy did not act as a mediating factor and was independently related to death anxiety and psychiatric comorbidity. Results were discussed in light of theories regarding death anxiety and the agentic model.

519,Fast food and financial impatience: A socioecological approach,"We investigated whether the prevalence of fast-food restaurants in the social ecology are associated with greater financial impatience at the national, neighborhood, and individual level. Study 1 shows that the proliferation of fast-food restaurants over the past 3 decades in the developed world was associated with a historic shift in financial impatience, as manifested in precipitously declining household savings rates. Study 2 finds that households saved less when living in neighborhoods with a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants relative to full-service restaurants. With a direct measure of individuals’ delay discounting preferences, Study 3 confirms that a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants within one’s neighborhood is associated with greater financial impatience. In line with a causal relationship, Study 4 reveals that recalling a recent fast-food, as opposed to full-service, dining experience at restaurants within the same neighborhood induced greater delay discounting, which was mediated behaviorally by how quickly participants completed the recall task itself. Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that pedestrians walking down the same urban street exhibited greater delay discounting in their choice of financial reward if they were surveyed in front of a fast-food restaurant, compared to a full-service restaurant. Collectively, these data indicate a link between the prevalence of fast food and financial impatience across multiple levels of analysis, and suggest the plausibility of fast food having a reinforcing effect on financial impatience. The present investigation highlights how the pervasiveness of organizational cues in the everyday social ecology can have a far-ranging influence.

520,Fear of Muslims: Psychometric evaluation of the Islamophobia Scale,"The Islamophobia Scale ({IS}) is a self-report measure of an individual’s fear-related attitudes toward Muslims and the religion of Islam (S. A. Lee, J. A. Gibbons, J. M. Thompson, \& H. S. Timani, 2009, The Islamophobia Scale: Instrument development and initial validation, International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, Vol. 19, pp. 92–105). In order to further validate the psychometric properties of the {IS}, the current study conducted a confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) and a test–retest reliability analysis (Study 1), a multitrait–multimethod ({MTMM}) study (Study 2), and an incremental validation study (Study 3). In addition, construct validity was examined across all of the studies using correlations with other instruments. The results demonstrated that the {IS} is reliable across time, is more factorially sound as a two-factor model, and is correlated with expected instruments. The {MTMM} demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity, rivaling forgiveness and right-wing authoritarianism ({RWA}) measures for the cognitive component, but not for the affective–behavioral component. However, the affective–behavioral component explained variance over and above {RWA} and Arab prejudice measures for sympathetic reactions to a suffering Muslim.

521,Development and preliminary validation of the Negative Attitude Toward Immigrants Scale,"Two studies describing the development of the Negative Attitude Toward Immigrants Scale ({NATIS}) are presented. In Study 1, undergraduates (N = 167) responded to a pool of 40 researcher-developed items measuring attitudes toward immigrants and immigration, as well as measures of legal authoritarianism, dogmatism, and Five-Factor Model personality traits. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a single 30-item factor, which was reduced to 12 items when all immigration-themed items were removed. The 12-item {NATIS} demonstrated good internal consistency and correlated positively with political orientation, legal authoritarianism, dogmatism, and extraversion, and negatively with openness. In Study 2, community members called for jury duty (N = 224) completed the 12-item {NATIS} as well as the same measures as Study 1 (with the exception of dogmatism). Significant positive correlations were found in Study 2 between {NATIS} score and conservative political orientation and legal authoritarianism, and significant negative correlations with openness and agreeableness. Participants in Study 2 also read one of three vignettes describing an assault against an unauthorized Mexican immigrant, authorized Mexican immigrant, or Caucasian victim, and provided ratings of perpetrator guilt. {NATIS} scores were inversely related with perpetrator guilt ratings among participants high in authoritarianism when the hate crime victim was an undocumented immigrant. Future directions for research with the {NATIS} are discussed.

522,Advancing innovations in social/personality psychology and health: Opportunities and challenges,"Social, personality, and health psychologists have a long tradition of active and productive collaborations that have advanced the development of intervention strategies that promote health and well-being and the specification of the theoretical principles that underlie those strategies. This special issue is designed to continue this tradition of collaboration and to highlight areas of research and investigative strategies that offer opportunities for innovation. This concluding paper examines how investigators construe the interface between theory and practice and, with that lens, considers several themes that have emerged across the papers that comprise this special issue. As evidenced by the papers in this special issue, investigators are well-positioned to leverage advances in understanding of human health and well-being. However, to capitalize on this opportunity, investigators need to commit to cultivating a culture of scientific activity that prioritizes the engagement of theory and practice–the pursuit of both understanding and use.

523,"Judge, that ye shall be judged: Interpersonal judgments of religious characteristics within faith communities","Recent theorizing has begun to suggest that spirituality may be transmitted through the observation and imitation of spiritual exemplars. However, there has been little systematic research on how and with what criteria individuals identify such models. The current study evaluates how religious constructs are judged among members of faith communities and assesses the relationship of these judgments with the selection of spiritual models. Using a round-robin design, 85 laypersons across six mainline Protestant churches in the United States rated their fellow congregants. A Social Relations analysis revealed statistically significant levels of consensus for religious commitment, intrinsic orientation, and who among them are spiritual exemplars, indicating some community-wide agreement about members’ respective religious characteristics. Nevertheless, identifying a fellow congregant as a spiritual model was found to be largely relational and highly reciprocal. These results suggest that spiritual modeling is in large part characterized by a mutually reinforcing process among peers.

524,Reactive approach motivation ({RAM}) for religion,"In 3 experiments, participants reacted with religious zeal to anxious uncertainty threats that have caused reactive approach motivation ({RAM}) in past research (see {McGregor}, Nash, Mann, \& Phills, 2010, for implicit, explicit, and neural evidence of {RAM}). In Study 1, results were specific to religious ideals and did not extend to merely superstitious beliefs. Effects were most pronounced among the most anxious and uncertainty-averse participants in Study 1 and among the most approach-motivated participants in Study 2 (i.e., with high Promotion Focus, Behavioral Activation, Action Orientation, and Self-Esteem Scale scores). In Studies 2 and 3, anxious uncertainty threats amplified even the most jingoistic and extreme aspects of religious zeal. In Study 3, reactive religious zeal occurred only among participants who reported feeling disempowered in their everyday goals in life. Results support a {RAM} view of empowered religious idealism for anxiety management (cf. Armstrong, 2000; Inzlicht, {McGregor}, Hirsch, \& Nash, 2009).

525,Religious coping across a spectrum of religious involvement among Jews,"The present study examined the extent to which general religiousness moderated the relationship between religious coping and mental health in a sample of 572 Jewish adults. Hierarchical linear regression was utilized to examine interactions between religiousness and positive/negative religious coping and their effects on mental health. Results indicated that positive religious coping predicted higher subjective well-being, but not (higher or lower) depression or anxiety, and negative religious coping predicted lower subjective well-being, greater depression, and elevated anxiety. Surprisingly, general religiousness—regardless of how it was measured (e.g., religious practices, intrinsic religiosity, religious affiliation)—did not moderate relationships between religious coping and mental health. These findings suggest that religious coping associates with mental health across the entire spectrum of religious involvement for Jews, highlighting that religious coping is an important mental health variable in this population, irrespective of individual religious differences.

526,Terror management and aggression: Evidence that mortality salience motivates aggression against worldview-threatening others,"The hypothesis that mortality salience ({MS}) motivates aggression against worldview-threatening others was tested in 4 studies. In Study 1, the experimenters induced participants to write about either their own death or a control topic, presented them with a target who either disparaged their political views or did not, and gave them the opportunity to choose the amount of hot sauce the target would have to consume. As predicted, {MS} participants allocated a particularly large amount of hot sauce to the worldview-threatening target. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors found that following {MS} induction, the opportunity to express a negative attitude toward the critical target eliminated aggression and the opportunity to aggress against the target eliminated derogation. This suggests that derogation and aggression are two alternative modes of responding to {MS} that serve the same psychological function. Finally, Study 4 showed that {MS} did not encourage aggression against a person who allocated unpleasant juice to the participant, supporting the specificity of {MS}-induced aggression to worldview-threatening others.

527,The existential underpinnings of intergroup helping: When normative and defensive motivations collide,"Five studies examined defensive intergroup helping—when responsibility for an out-group victim’s injury decreases helping, whereas lack of responsibility increases helping when death is salient. In Study 1 (N = 350), implicit death primes increased petition signings to allow a Palestinian child to receive medical treatment in Israel, when the child was a victim of Palestinian fire. When the child was a victim of Israeli fire, however, death primes decreased petition signings. Study 2 (N = 200) partially replicated these effects on commitment to donate blood to an injured Palestinian child. Study 3 (N = 162) found that moral affirmation primes moderate defensive helping effects. Study 4 (N = 372) replicated defensive helping, but failed to replicate the moral affirmation effect found in Study 3. Study 5 (N = 243) partially replicated defensive helping and found that different framings of existential threat moderate the effect. Overall, results indicate that self-protective concerns underlie prosocial responses to out-group members in need.

528,"Authoritarianism, threat, and declining tolerance and support for democracy: Evidence from the post-Arab spring middle East","Since the outbreak of the Arab Spring in 2011, the Middle East has backslid from a promising march toward democracy back into autocratic rule. The effects of these events on intolerance and support for democracy, however, have yet to be investigated. I offer evidence that threat posed by the Arab Spring has resulted in an increase in intolerance and a decrease in support for democracy. I argue that these population-level changes are driven by the unique interaction between authoritarianism and threat. Authoritarianism---a value continuum that places the need for conformity and order over independence and self-expression---is known in Western samples to interact with both normative and existential threats to increase intolerance. Specifically, those high in authoritarianism become more intolerant when cultural and societal norms are threatened and those low in authoritarianism (libertarians) become more tolerant, as they fear an authoritarian backlash that threatens their value system emphasizing independence and diversity. When personally threatened, high authoritarians are unreactive as their value system is not threatened, but libertarians become less tolerant as their basic security needs are not met, thus threatening their value system that emphasizes independence. These conditional relationships between authoritarianism, threat, and intolerance are the principal components of Authoritarian Dynamic Theory ({ADT}). In addition to explaining intolerance, I expand this framework to the study of support for democratic and autocratic political institutions in the context of such a threatening environment. As democracies are characterized by political competition and pluralism, I argue that the authoritarian need for order and defense of established, autocratic norms in the region render high authoritarians less supportive of democracy and more supportive of autocratic arrangements. Conversely, libertarians should be more supportive of democracy and less so of autocracy. I expect that these preferences will be subject to the same dynamics of normative and existential threat as intolerance. Using an original measure of authoritarianism, I find evidence that libertarians in the Middle East react as predicted by {ADT}. Under personal threat, libertarians become more intolerant, more supportive of autocracy, and less supportive of democracy. Under normative threat, libertarians become less intolerant, less supportive of autocracy, and more supportive of democracy. High authoritarians are largely unmoved by threat. Unexpectedly, however, I find that high authoritarians are generally more supportive of democracy and less supportive of autocracy. I find post-hoc suggestive evidence that this is due to authoritarian support for Islamists during their ascension to power at the ballot box in the region. I then present a laboratory experiment conducted in Egypt to link specific Arab Spring threats to authoritarianism, intolerance, and support for political institutions. I find evidence that libertarians are generally more tolerant and supportive of democracy and less so of democracy than high authoritarians, as hypothesized. This suggests that, five years after the forced removal of democratically-elected Islamists, authoritarians no longer had an instrumental interest in supporting democracy and returned to relying on their authoritarian value system for influencing their institutional preferences. The expected changes in support and intolerance conditional upon threat are in the correct direction, though statistically insignificant. The experiment suggests that libertarians are largely responsible for the decreased polarization in intolerance and support for institutions as their attitudes and preferences move closer to those of authoritarians.

529,Awe and humility,"Humility is a foundational virtue that counters selfish inclinations such as entitlement, arrogance, and narcissism (Tangney, 2000). We hypothesize that experiences of awe promote greater humility. Guided by an appraisal-tendency framework of emotion, we propose that when individuals encounter an entity that is vast and challenges their worldview, they feel awe, which leads to self-diminishment and subsequently humility. In support of these claims, awe-prone individuals were rated as more humble by friends (Study 1) and reported greater humility across a 2-week period (Study 2), controlling for other positive emotions. Inducing awe led participants to present a more balanced view of their strengths and weaknesses to others (Study 3) and acknowledge, to a greater degree, the contribution of outside forces in their own personal accomplishments (Study 4), compared with neutral and positive control conditions. Finally, an awe-inducing expansive view elicited greater reported humility than a neutral view (Study 5). We also elucidated the process by which awe leads to humility. Feelings of awe mediated the relationship between appraisals (perceptions of vastness and a challenge to one’s world view) and humility (Study 4), and self-diminishment mediated the relationship between awe and humility (Study 5). Taken together, these results reveal that awe offers one path to greater humility.

530,Self-regulatory processes defend against the threat of death: Effects of self-control depletion and trait self-control on thoughts and fears of dying,"Nine studies (N = 979) demonstrated that managing the threat of death requires self-regulation. Both trait and state self-control ability moderated the degree to which people experienced death-related thought and anxiety. Participants high (vs. low) in self-control generated fewer death-related thoughts after being primed with death, reported less death anxiety, were less likely to perceive death-related themes in ambiguous scenes, and reacted with less worldview defense when mortality was made salient. Further, coping with thoughts of death led to self-regulatory fatigue. After writing about death versus a control topic, participants performed worse on several measures of self-regulation that were irrelevant to death. These results suggest that self-regulation is a key intrapsychic mechanism for alleviating troublesome thoughts and feelings about mortality.

531,Rethinking intractable conflict: The perspective of dynamical systems,"Intractable conflicts are demoralizing. Beyond destabilizing the families, communities, or international regions in which they occur, they tend to perpetuate the very conditions of misery and hate that contributed to them in the first place. Although the common factors and processes associated with intractable conflicts have been identified through research, they represent an embarrassment of riches for theory construction. Thus, the current task in this area is integrating these diverse factors into an account that provides a coherent perspective yet allows for prediction and a basis for conflict resolution in specific conflict settings. We suggest that the perspective of dynamical systems provides such an account. This article outlines the key concepts and hypotheses associated with this approach. It is organized around a set of basic questions concerning intractable conflict for which the dynamical perspective offers fresh insight and testable propositions. The questions and answers are intended to provide readers with basic concepts and principles of complexity and dynamical systems that are useful for rethinking the nature of intractable conflict and the means by which such conflict can be transformed.

532,"Supporting the dehumanization hypothesis, but under what conditions? A commentary on Over (2021)","Comments on an article by Harriet Over (see record [rid]2021-08448-001[/rid]). The authors are dehumanization researchers and therefore have a vested scholarly interest in the importance of this construct. Over suggests that there is reason to question the dehumanization hypothesis—which refers to two hypotheses, actually: (a) out-group members are viewed as nonhuman, and (b) this underlies the harm inflicted on them. Authors comments are presented in two parts. First, the authors review each of the seven points and consider whether they constitute a significant challenge to what we believe to be true about dehumanization. They then consider the conditions under which the hypothesis is true—that is, when out-group members are dehumanized and when this dehumanization leads to harm. They consider some moderators defining the circumstances under which this process is likely to occur, drawing from the perspective of terror-management theory and research on the objectification of women. In doing so, the authors are careful to distinguish between animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization, because it makes sense that the moderating factors depend on the category of non-humanness with which an individual is associated.

Participants (N = 205) took part in a semester-long lecture/lab-style course titled Buddhist Meditation and Modernity. The course (a) taught secular contemplative practices, (b) provided a scientific background on the impact and mechanisms of meditation, and (c) reviewed the historical roots of meditative practice. All 5 facets of mindfulness assessed, except for observing and nonjudging, correlated with each other. Additionally, all 5 facets showed positive correlations with the presence of meaning in life, and there was a significant negative correlation between the nonjudging facet of mindfulness and search for meaning in life. Participants, who were measured pre-, post-, and midsemester, reported positive changes over time on all 5 facets of mindfulness and presence of meaning in life. This study provides additional evidence for the connection between meditation, mindfulness, and meaning in life. We conclude by discussing limitations and areas for future research.

534,"Lost in the Wilderness: Terror Management, Action Orientation, and Nature Evaluation","The authors propose that wilderness is intrinsically associated with death, and, consequently, terror management concerns may promote more negative evaluations of wilderness. Consistent with this, wilderness inspired more thoughts about death than either cultivated nature or urban environments (Study 1), and death reminders reduced perceived beauty of wilderness (Study 2). The authors further suggest that active self-regulation facilitates suppression of the dark side of wilderness. Consistent with this, action orientation was positively related to perceived beauty of wilderness (Study 3), and after viewing wilderness, action-oriented individuals were more efficient at suppressing the association between wilderness and death than state-oriented individuals (Study 4). Direct death reminders overruled the effects of action orientation on nature evaluation (Study 5), presumably because direct death reminders are difficult to suppress even for action-oriented individuals.

535,The attenuating effect of mortality salience on dishonest behavior,"People are easily tempted to engage in dishonest behavior when an incentive is given and when full anonymity is provided. In the present work, we investigated existential threat as a motivational factor that might reduce dishonest behavior. Research based on terror management theory has found that mortality salience increases the motivation to fulfill salient values of one’s cultural worldview. Assuming the concept of honesty is important to human societies, we hypothesized that mortality salience will reduce dishonest behavior when the concept of honesty is salient. In two experiments, we assessed dishonesty under full anonymity by applying a die-under-the-cup paradigm with the expected value serving as a stochastic baseline for honest behavior. Both experiments provided support for our hypothesis. Given an incentive to cheat, when the concept of honesty was cognitively activated by a word-search puzzle (Study 1) or by the name of the dice game (i.e., 'honest game'; Study 2), mortality salient participants showed not only less dishonest behavior but actually honest behavior.

Study 1 demonstrated that people are more likely to conform with other’s opinions when self-uncertainty rather than certainty is activated. Study 2 revealed that self-uncertainty mediates the effect of {MS} on conformity: people become uncertain of themselves and more likely to conform to other’s opinions when they think about death. Study 3 investigated the mediation effect from the perspective of relatively stable traits, revealing that dispositional death anxiety positively predicted trait conformity and that increased trait self-uncertainty accounted for this relationship (full mediation). In summary, substantial and robust evidence indicated that self-uncertainty plays a critical role in {MS} effect on conformity.

A total of 122 university students completed measures of political orientation, authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation prior to being randomly assigned to a mortality salience or control condition. Political conservatism, authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation were all associated with more negative attitudes toward illegal immigrants. Although there was no main effect for mortality salience, there was an interaction between mortality salience and social dominance orientation. Higher social dominance orientation was associated with more negative attitudes toward illegal immigrants, albeit only in the mortality salience condition.

538,Processes and preconditions underlying terrorism in second-generation immigrants,"The purpose of this article is to encourage empirical research on the precursors and processes underlying terrorism in second-generation immigrants. While the Western-born children of immigrants may be at no greater risk of terrorism overall, their strategic significance as a resource for violent groups makes it important for researchers to understand the factors that may lead even a small number of these individuals to terrorism. Existing literature on the context, process, and identity factors contributing to terrorism is reviewed. Drawing on a social identity framework, it is argued that a number of additional factors will be relevant to second-generation terrorists, and that these will depend on the individual's particular pattern of cultural identification. Three forms of cultural identification in the second-generation are thus identified: ingroup, outgroup, and transitional outgroup identification. The implications of each for understanding terrorism are discussed, and suggestions for future research are presented.

539,"The end is (not) near: Aging, essentialism, and future time perspective","Beliefs about aging influence how we interpret and respond to changes within and around us. Essentialist beliefs about aging are defined as views that link chronological age with inherent and immutable properties underlying aging-related changes. These beliefs may influence the experience of aging-related changes and shape people’s outlook of the future. We hypothesized that people who endorse essentialist beliefs about aging report a more limited future time perspective. Two studies provided correlational (Study 1, N = 250; 18–77 years) and experimental (Study 2, N = 103; 20–77 years) evidence that essentialist beliefs about aging affect people’s future time perspective. In addition, Study 2 and Study 3 (N = 174; 34–67 years) tested the underlying mechanism and provided evidence that perception of aging-related threat explains the effect of essentialist beliefs on a reduced future time perspective. These findings highlight the fundamental role of essentialist beliefs about aging for the perception of time horizons in the context of aging.

The objective of the present article is to show the important role that issues of status play in linking herding regions to cultures of honor using the theory of low-status compensation (P. J.

Study 1 replicates the finding that counties in the American South conducive to herding have higher murder rates than do counties conducive to farming but shows those differences are mediated by indicators of status disparities in a county. Study 2 replicates the findings of Study 1 with an international sample of 92 countries. Study 3 tests the theoretical idea that people who are low in socioeconomic status face stigma in society and show self-defensive strategies generally. Finally, Study 4 provides experimental evidence that low-status tendencies toward aggressing in the face of insults may be due to strategies to protect their sense of social worth. The results are contextualized within the theory of low-status compensation as a theory for understanding the role status plays in predicting some forms of violence.

The evolutionary framework of life history theory predicts that preferences for risk and delay in gratification should be influenced by mortality and resource scarcity. A series of experiments examined how mortality cues influenced decisions involving risk preference (e.g., \$10 for sure vs. 50\% chance of \$20) and temporal discounting (e.g., \$5 now vs. \$10 later). The effect of mortality depended critically on whether people grew up in a relatively resource-scarce or resource-plentiful environment. For individuals who grew up relatively poor, mortality cues led them to value the present and gamble for big immediate rewards. Conversely, for individuals who grew up relatively wealthy, mortality cues led them to value the future and avoid risky gambles. Overall, mortality cues appear to propel individuals toward diverging life history strategies as a function of childhood socioeconomic status, suggesting important implications for how environmental factors influence economic decisions and risky behaviors.

542,The role of social presence in mortality salience effects,"Terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg et al., 1986) suggests that reminders of death intensify the desire to express cultural norms leading to culturally prescribed behavior such as charitable giving, church attendance, and exorbitant spending. Living up to these norms provides high levels of self-esteem, which can serve as a buffer against existential anxiety. The present paper argues that people can experience an extra self-esteem boost when they act in accordance with cultural norms while others can observe this behavior. More specifically, the present studies hypothesized and found that the presence of others (i.e., social presence) moderates mortality salience effects on consumption-related behavior. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers, under conditions of mortality salience, express more favorable attitudes towards a luxury brand (valued in Western cultures) when they know that other can observe their behavior. Study 2 extended these results to non-luxury brands. Under conditions of mortality salience, consumers express less favorable evaluations of non-luxury (non-valued brands) when they are aware of the presence of others. These results imply that consumers derive self-esteem indirectly from the knowledge that others observe their appropriate behavior rather than directly from following the cultural values or norms of one's society.

543,"Leadership, followership, and evolution: Some lessons from the past","This article analyzes the topic of leadership from an evolutionary perspective and proposes three conclusions that are not part of mainstream theory. First, leading and following are strategies that evolved for solving social coordination problems in ancestral environments, including in particular the problems of group movement, intragroup peacekeeping, and intergroup competition. Second, the relationship between leaders and followers is inherently ambivalent because of the potential for exploitation of followers by leaders. Third, modern organizational structures are sometimes inconsistent with aspects of our evolved leadership psychology, which might explain the alienation and frustration of many citizens and employees. The authors draw several implications of this evolutionary analysis for leadership theory, research, and practice.

544,"Cross-lagged relationships between self-esteem, self-construal, and happiness in a three-wave longitudinal study","Previous research established that an independent construal of the self is associated with higher self-esteem, which, in turn, is associated with increased happiness. Regarding the directionality of these relationships, theoretical arguments have suggested that self-construal precedes self-esteem and that self-esteem precedes happiness. However, most research in this area is cross-sectional, thus limiting any conclusions about directionality. The present study tested these relationships in 101 Romanian undergraduates using a 3-wave cross-lagged design with a 6-month time lag between every two waves. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that self-esteem is an antecedent of both happiness and dimensions of independent self-construal (i.e., consistency vs. variability and self-expression vs. harmony). In other words, one’s positive evaluation of self-worth precedes one’s self-perception as being a happy and independent person. The findings are discussed with respect to the theoretical and practical implications, along with limitations and suggestions for future research.

545,"Left or right? Sources of political orientation: The roles of genetic factors, cultural transmission, assortative mating, and personality","In this study, we used an extended twin family design to investigate the influences of genetic and cultural transmission as well as different sources of nonrandom mating on 2 core aspects of political orientation: acceptance of inequality and rejecting system change. In addition, we studied the sources of phenotypic links between Big Five personality traits and political beliefs using self- and other reports. Data of 1,992 individuals (224 monozygotic and 166 dizygotic twin pairs, 92 unmatched twins, 530 spouses of twins, 268 fathers, and 322 mothers) were analyzed. Genetically informative analyses showed that political attitudes are genetically but not environmentally transmitted from parents to offspring and that a substantial proportion of this genetic variance can be accounted for by genetic variance in personality traits. Beyond genetic effects and genotypic assortative mating, generation-specific environmental sources act to increase twins' and spouses' resemblance in political beliefs. The results suggest multiple sources of political orientations in a modern democracy.

546,Explaining the justice–performance relationship: Trust as exchange deepener or trust as uncertainty reducer?,"Past research has revealed significant relationships between organizational justice dimensions and job performance, and trust is thought to be one mediator of those relationships. However, trust has been positioned in justice theorizing in 2 different ways, either as an indicator of the depth of an exchange relationship or as a variable that reflects levels of work-related uncertainty. Moreover, trust scholars distinguish between multiple forms of trust, including affect- and cognition-based trust, and it remains unclear which form is most relevant to justice effects. To explore these issues, we built and tested a more comprehensive model of trust mediation in which procedural, interpersonal, and distributive justice predicted affect- and cognition-based trust, with those trust forms predicting both exchange- and uncertainty-based mechanisms. The results of a field study in a hospital system revealed that the trust variables did indeed mediate the relationships between the organizational justice dimensions and job performance, with affect-based trust driving exchange-based mediation and cognition-based trust driving uncertainty-based mediation.

547,The Manhattan effect: When relationship commitment fails to promote support for partners’ interests,"Research on close relationships has frequently contrasted one’s own interests with the interests of the partner or the relationship and has tended to view the partner’s and the relationship’s interests as inherently aligned. The present article demonstrated that relationship commitment typically causes people to support their partner’s personal interests but that this effect gets weaker to the extent that those interests misalign or even threaten the relationship. Studies 1a and 1b showed that (a) despite their strong correlation, partner-oriented and relationship-oriented concerns in goal-directed behaviors are separable and (b) relationship commitment strengthens only the link between relationship-oriented motivation and the goal pursuit (not the link between partner-oriented motivation and the goal pursuit). The remaining 7 studies zero in on circumstances in which the partner’s and the relationship’s interests are in conflict, demonstrating that (c) relationship commitment reliably increases the tendency to support the partner’s personal interests when those interests do not pose a strong threat to the relationship but that (d) this effect becomes weaker—and even reverses direction—as the relationship threat posed by the partner’s interests becomes stronger. The reduction or reversal of the positive link between relationship commitment and propartner behaviors in such situations is termed the Manhattan effect. These findings suggest that the partner-versus-relationship conflicts provide fertile ground for novel theorizing and empirical investigations and that relationship commitment appears to be less of a partner-promoting construct than relationship science has suggested; instead, its role appears to be focused on promoting the interests of the relationship.

548,Mortality salience effects on modesty and relative self-effacement,"Terror management theory argues that mortality salience ({MS}) enhances adherence to cultural norms. Recent cross-cultural research has suggested that Japanese culture emphasizes modesty and the enhancement of important others compared to the self. Thus, it was predicted that Japanese would show increased modesty and relative self-effacement in response to {MS}. In addition, the moderating effects of degree of enculturation were examined in two studies investigating Japanese undergraduates. Those strongly enculturated to the Japanese worldview showed a tendency to evaluate success more negatively (Study 1) and self-efface more relative to their close friends (Study 2). A view which regards both Easterners' self-effacement and Westerners' self-enhancement after {MS} to be a reflection of efforts to fit into cultural norm is presented.

549,The relationship between mock jurors’ religious characteristics and their verdicts and sentencing decisions,"Two mock jury studies investigated whether jurors’ religious characteristics relate to verdicts and sentencing decisions. In Study 1, adding religious characteristics to a model with only demographics and authoritarianism increased the model’s explanatory power. Scoring high on devotionalism was significantly related to not guilty verdicts; scoring high on fundamentalism was significantly related to guilty verdicts. In both studies, being on a religious quest was significantly related to prodefendant legal decisions. Lawyers can use this information in jury selection. Further, authoritarianism was a mediator of the relationship between some religious variables and legal decisions, helping explain the underlying reasons for such relationships.

550,"Fame, Facebook, and Twitter: How attitudes about fame predict frequency and nature of social media use","Social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) offers the opportunity to both enact and respond to public performances of self, as well as to follow and interact with actual public figures. However, to date, we know little about how users’ attitudes about fame intersect with their social media behaviors. The present survey study (Mturk; n = 371) investigated links between fame appeal and participants’ Facebook and Twitter use. Fame attitudes were measured via a scale tapping the appeal of Visibility (e.g., being on the cover of a magazine), Status (e.g., traveling first class), and Prosocial (e.g., being able to financially support friends and family) aspects of fame, as well as time spent fantasizing about fame and the perceived realism of becoming famous one day. Visibility was the most robustly and consistently predictive of active and celebrity-oriented social media behaviors (posting and responding vs. reading; increased number of media figures followed, more frequent responses to media figure posts). Fame Fantasy and Fame Realism showed similar, although less robust, patterns. Individuals with active Facebook and Twitter accounts showed increased fame affinity relative to those with only one or none. Findings showcase the fame-relevant function of social media and the common motivational threads that may tie fame interest to social media use.

551,In search of meaningfulness: Nostalgia as an antidote to boredom,"We formulated, tested, and supported, in 6 studies, a theoretical model according to which individuals use nostalgia as a way to reinject meaningfulness in their lives when they experience boredom. Studies 1–3 established that induced boredom causes increases in nostalgia when participants have the opportunity to revert to their past. Studies 4 and 5 examined search for meaning as a mediator of the effect of boredom on nostalgia. Specifically, Study 4 showed that search for meaning mediates the effect of state boredom on nostalgic memory content, whereas Study 5 demonstrated that search for meaning mediates the effect of dispositional boredom on dispositional nostalgia. Finally, Study 6 examined the meaning reestablishment potential of nostalgia during boredom: Nostalgia mediates the effect of boredom on sense of meaningfulness and presence of meaning in one’s life. Nostalgia counteracts the meaninglessness that individuals experience when they are bored. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","van Tilburg, Wijn and A.

552,Disgust: Evolved function and structure,"Interest in and research on disgust has surged over the past few decades. The field, however, still lacks a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the evolved function or functions of disgust. Here we present such a framework, emphasizing 2 levels of analysis: that of evolved function and that of information processing. Although there is widespread agreement that disgust evolved to motivate the avoidance of contact with disease-causing organisms, there is no consensus about the functions disgust serves when evoked by acts unrelated to pathogen avoidance. Here we suggest that in addition to motivating pathogen avoidance, disgust evolved to regulate decisions in the domains of mate choice and morality. For each proposed evolved function, we posit distinct information processing systems that integrate function-relevant information and account for the trade-offs required of each disgust system. By refocusing the discussion of disgust on computational mechanisms, we recast prior theorizing on disgust into a framework that can generate new lines of empirical and theoretical inquiry.

553,Experimental findings on God as an attachment figure: Normative processes and moderating effects of internal working models,"Four studies examined implications of attachment theory for psychological aspects of religion among Israeli Jews. Study 1 replicated previous correlational findings indicating correspondence among interpersonal attachment orientations, attachment to God, and image of God. Studies 2–4 were subliminal priming experiments, which documented both normative and individual-difference effects. Regarding normative effects, findings indicated that threat priming heightened cognitive access to God-related concepts in a lexical decision task (Study 2); priming with 'God' heightened cognitive access to positive, secure base-related concepts in the same task (Study 3); and priming with a religious symbol caused neutral material to be better liked (Study 4). Regarding individual differences, interpersonal attachment-related avoidance reduced the normative effects (i.e., avoidant participants had lower implicit access to God as a safe haven and secure base). Findings were mostly independent of level of religiousness. The present experiments considerably extend the psychological literature on connections between attachment constructs and aspects of religion.

554,"Rally effects, threat, and attitude change: An integrative approach to understanding the role of emotion","Rally 'round the flag effects (J. E. Mueller, 1970) represent sudden and dramatically powerful situation-specific shifts in attitudes toward the American president. However, the extant literature has yet to fully clarify the nature of the psychological dynamics associated with this effect. These ambiguities reflect fundamental differences of opinion among scholars on some very basic questions such as whether overtly experienced emotion should mediate these attitudinal shifts or whether these changes reflect more general shifts in conservative ideology. Across 4 experiments, the authors sought to gain greater clarity on these and other important matters using a multimethod approach in which the authors varied whether participants viewed documentary footage of the 9/11 attacks (Experiments 1–2), generated autobiographical memories of that event (Experiment 3), or retrieved nonpolitical memories from their past (Experiment 4). The authors discuss the relevance of the present findings for theory and research across a variety of different theoretical and methodological paradigms, including social psychological models of threat, emotional appraisal models, and the political science literature.

555,Perceptions of cancer as a death sentence: Tracking trends in public perceptions from 2008 to 2017,"Objective There has been steady progress in reducing cancer mortality in the United States; however, this progress hasn't been evenly distributed across regions. This paper assesses trends in cancer mortality salience ({CMS}), that is, agreeing that getting cancer is a death sentence, over time in the United States and examines correlates of {CMS}. Methods Data from three administrations of the Health Information National Trends Survey ({HINTS}), gathered in 2008, 2013, and 2017, were merged, resulting in a total sample of 10,063 respondents. Trends in changes in {CMS} over time were examined as well as maps of the distribution of {CMS} in the United States. A logistic regression model was conducted, regressing {CMS} on a set of sociodemographic, psychological, health‐related, and environmental predictors. Results The aggregated percentage of {US} adults who agreed with the {CMS} statement changed over time and was modified by age. Geographic distribution of agreement with {CMS} was inconsistent across the United States. In the adjusted logistic model, perceived health (worse health), cancer prevention, fatalism, and confusion, and cancer status (no cancer) were all significantly associated with {CMS}. There was also a significant interaction between survey year and age. Conclusion Despite recent information that cancer mortality rates are decreasing, most {US} adults still see cancer as a death sentence and this is especially an issue in certain subgroups. These findings have ramifications for groups of people who may be at risk for developing cancer given their attitudes and beliefs that there isn't much they can do to prevent or control it.

556,Memory strength and lineup presentation moderate effects of administrator influence on mistaken identifications,"Administrator/witness pairs (N = 313) were randomly assigned to target-absent lineups in a 2 (Suspect/Perpetrator Similarity: High Suspect Similarity vs. Low Suspect Similarity) × 2 (Retention Interval: 30 min vs. 1 week) × 2 (Lineup Presentation: Simultaneous vs. Sequential) × 2 (Administrator Knowledge: Single-Blind vs. Double-Blind) factorial design to test whether suspect similarity and memory strength constrain interpersonal expectancy effects on eyewitness identification accuracy. Administrators who knew which lineup member was the suspect (single-blind) or who administered simultaneous lineups were more likely to emit verbal and nonverbal behaviors that suggested to the witness who the suspect was. Additionally, single-blind administrators exerted more pressure on witnesses to choose the suspect as opposed to fillers. Administrator knowledge interacted with retention interval and lineup presentation to influence mistaken identifications of innocent suspects; witnesses were more likely to mistakenly identify an innocent suspect from single-blind than double-blind lineups when witness retention intervals were long and photographs were presented simultaneously. Contrary to our predictions, suspect/perpetrator similarity did not interact with other manipulated variables to influence identification decisions. Both sequential and double-blind procedures should be used to reduce the use of suggestive behavior during lineup administration.

557,Two types of religious internalization and their relations to religious orientations and mental health,"Two types of religious internalization are conceptualized that are presumed to vary in their relative autonomy. Introjection represents a partial internalization of beliefs and is characterized by self- and other-approval-based pressure. Identification represents adoption of beliefs as personal values and is characterized by greater volition. These 2 types of internalization are compared conceptually and empirically with existing measures of religious orientation and are used to predict varied functional outcomes. Results in 4 independent Christian samples show systematic construct validities and relations with mental health and self-related outcomes. Also, evangelical teenagers are shown to be higher on both introjection and identification than controls. Results are discussed both in terms of prior approaches to the psychology of religion and the significance of internalization for personality functioning.

558,"I am what I do, not what I have: The differential centrality of experiential and material purchases to the self","What kinds of purchases do the most to make us happy? Previous research (Carter \& Gilovich, 2010; Van Boven \& Gilovich, 2003) indicates that experiences, such as vacations and concerts, are more likely to do so than material possessions, such as clothes and electronic gadgets. The present research was designed to explore 1 potential explanation for this result, namely, that experiences tend to be more closely associated with the self than possessions. The authors first show that people tend to think of their experiential purchases as more connected to the self than their possessions. Compared with their material purchases, participants drew their experiential purchases physically closer to the self (Study 1), were more likely to mention them when telling their life story (Study 2), and felt that a purchase described in terms of its experiential, rather than its material, qualities would overlap more with their sense of who they are (Study 4). Participants also felt that knowing a person's experiential purchases, compared with their material purchases, would yield greater insight into that person's true self (Studies 3A–3C). The authors then show that the tendency to cling more closely to cherished experiential memories is connected to the greater satisfaction people derive from experiences than possessions (Study 5).

559,Coronavirus : Cerveau prédictif et gestion de la terreur = Coronavirus: Predictive brain and terror management,"Emerging infectious diseases like Covid-19 cause a major threat to global health. When confronted with new pathogens, individuals generate several beliefs about the epidemic phenomenon. Many studies have shown that individual protective behaviors largely depend on these beliefs. Due to the absence of treatment and vaccine against these emerging pathogens, the relation between these beliefs and these behaviors represents a crucial issue for public health policies. In the premises of the Covid-19 pandemic, several preliminary studies have highlighted a delay in the perception of risk by individuals, which potentially holds back the implementing of the necessary precautionary measures: people underestimated the risks associated with the virus, and therefore also the importance of complying with sanitary guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, the salience of the threat and of the risk of mortality could then have transformed the way people generate their beliefs. This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world. Here, we propose to explore the evolution of beliefs and behaviors during the Covid-19 crisis, using the theory of predictive coding and the theory of terror management, two influential frameworks in cognitive science and in social psychology.

560,The pitfall of experimenting on the web: How unattended selective attrition leads to surprising (yet false) research conclusions,"The authors find that experimental studies using online samples (e.g., {MTurk}) often violate the assumption of random assignment, because participant attrition—quitting a study before completing it and getting paid—is not only prevalent, but also varies systemically across experimental conditions. Using standard social psychology paradigms (e.g., ego-depletion, construal level), they observed attrition rates ranging from 30\% to 50\% (Study 1). The authors show that failing to attend to attrition rates in online panels has grave consequences. By introducing experimental confounds, unattended attrition misled them to draw mind-boggling yet false conclusions: that recalling a few happy events is considerably more effortful than recalling many happy events, and that imagining applying eyeliner leads to weight loss (Study 2). In addition, attrition rate misled them to draw a logical yet false conclusion: that explaining one’s view on gun rights decreases progun sentiment (Study 3). The authors offer a partial remedy (Study 4) and call for minimizing and reporting experimental attrition in studies conducted on the Web.

561,General inattentiveness is a long-term reliable trait independently predictive of psychological health: Danish validation studies of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale,"The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}) measures perceived degree of inattentiveness in different contexts and is often used as a reversed indicator of mindfulness. {MAAS} is hypothesized to reflect a psychological trait or disposition when used outside attentional training contexts, but the long-term test–retest reliability of {MAAS} scores is virtually untested. It is unknown whether {MAAS} predicts psychological health after controlling for standardized socioeconomic status classifications. First, {MAAS} translated to Danish was validated psychometrically within a randomly invited healthy adult community sample (N = 490). Factor analysis confirmed that {MAAS} scores quantified a unifactorial construct of excellent composite reliability and consistent convergent validity. Structural equation modeling revealed that {MAAS} scores contributed independently to predicting psychological distress and mental health, after controlling for age, gender, income, socioeconomic occupational class, stressful life events, and social desirability (β = 0.32–.42, ps {\textless} .001). Second, {MAAS} scores showed satisfactory short-term test–retest reliability in 100 retested healthy university students. Finally, {MAAS} sample mean scores as well as individuals’ scores demonstrated satisfactory test–retest reliability across a 6 months interval in the adult community (retested N = 407), intraclass correlations ≥ .74. {MAAS} scores displayed significantly stronger long-term test–retest reliability than scores measuring psychological distress (z = 2.78, p = .005). Test–retest reliability estimates did not differ within demographic and socioeconomic strata. Scores on the Danish {MAAS} were psychometrically validated in healthy adults. {MAAS}’s inattentiveness scores reflected a unidimensional construct, long-term reliable disposition, and a factor of independent significance for predicting psychological health.

In all the studies, 18–21-yr-old male soldiers in Israeli Defence Forces (N = 603) reported on the relevance of driving to their self-esteem. Then half of them were exposed to various mortality salience inductions, and the remaining to a control condition. The dependent measures were either self-reported behavioral intentions of risky driving or driving speed in a car simulator. In Study 4, half of the participants in each condition received positive feedback about their quality of driving. Findings showed that mortality salience inductions led to more risky driving than the control condition only among individuals who perceived driving as relevant to their self-esteem. The introduction of positive feedback about driving eliminated this effect. The results were discussed in light of the self-enhancing mechanisms proposed by {TMT}.

564,Competencies for psychologists in the domains of religion and spirituality,"Religion and spirituality are important aspects of human diversity that should receive adequate attention in cultural competence training for psychologists. Furthermore, spiritual and religious beliefs and practices are relevant to psychological and emotional well-being, and clinicians who are trained to sensitively address these domains in their clinical practice should be more effective. Our research team previously published a set of 16 religious and spiritual competencies based on a combination of focus group and survey research with the intent that they could be used to guide training. In the present study, we conducted a survey to determine whether these competencies would be acceptable to a broader population of practicing clinicians. Results indicate a large degree of support for the proposed competencies. Between 73.0 and 94.1\% of respondents agreed that psychologists should receive training and demonstrate competence in each of the 16 areas. The majority (52.2\%–80.7\%) indicated that they had received little or no training, and between 29.7\% and 58.6\% had received no training at all, in these competencies. We conclude with recommendations for integrating these religious and spiritual competencies more fully into clinical training and practice.

565,What will remain when we are gone? Finitude and generation identity in the second half of life,"According to the dual age identity model, there are 2 types of age-related identities: 1 reflecting a person’s chronological age (i.e., age group membership) and 1 reflecting a person’s generation (i.e., cohort membership). Research has shown that, in the second half of life, people begin to identify more with their generation than with their chronological age. However, it is not yet clear why this is the case. The present research tests the hypothesis that generation identification is motivated by a need for continuity in the face of finitude. As predicted, Study 1 (N = 250, 18–77 years) demonstrates that asking participants to think about the last day of their life to induce thoughts about life’s finitude (vs. a control condition) led to higher levels of generation identification in midlife and beyond. Study 2 (N = 91, 18–83 years) shows that advanced age is associated with the need for generational continuity that, in turn, predicts a stronger identification with one’s generation. The discussion focuses on the age-differential function of generation identity in the face of finitude. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Weiss, David",0,,565

All versions of this article have been corrected.]  Despite a proliferation of research into posttraumatic growth, little attention has been paid to growth processes at the collective or group level. Where scholars have addressed collective posttraumatic growth, concepts such as cohesion and group identity have been flagged as positive responses to collective traumas such as the 9/11 bombings in the United States. However, although some have suggested that these responses may constitute positive change or posttraumatic growth, others have interpreted increases in group cohesion and collective identity as consistent with processes of ingroup enhancement. In a country like the United States, where the attack came from outside the country, at first glance, these processes may appear positive. On closer examination, however, it can be seen that ingroup enhancement co-occurs with outgroup derogation, which is clearly unfavorable for outgroup members. This article examines the case of Rwanda, where conflict arose between groups within the country. It shows how processes of ingroup enhancement are in fact disruptive rather than constructive because of this co-occurrence with processes of outgroup derogation. The article proposes an alternative model for understanding how collective posttraumatic growth may manifest itself, drawing on notions of agency and communion. By discursively analyzing the testimonies of female Rwandan genocide survivors, it is demonstrated that groups, much like individuals, must pursue drives of autonomy (freedom) and relatedness (reconciliation). By providing an understanding of collective responses to trauma and how posttraumatic growth is likely to manifest itself, such a model may offer insights into how positive change may be facilitated in postconflict societies.

567,The validity of crowdsourcing data in studying anger and aggressive behavior: A comparison of online and laboratory data,"Crowdsourcing platforms provide an affordable approach for recruiting large and diverse samples in a short time. Past research has shown that researchers can obtain reliable data from these sources, at least in domains of research that are not affectively involving. The goal of the present study was to test if crowdsourcing platforms can also be used to conduct experiments that incorporate the induction of aversive affective states. First, a laboratory experiment with German university students was conducted in which a frustrating task induced anger and aggressive behavior. This experiment was then replicated online using five crowdsourcing samples. The results suggest that participants in the online samples reacted very similarly to the anger manipulation as participants in the laboratory experiments. However, effect sizes were smaller in crowdsourcing samples with non-German participants while a crowdsourcing sample with exclusively German participants yielded virtually the same effect size as in the laboratory.

568,"Why bother? Death, failure, and fatalistic withdrawal from life","The current research examines the conditions under which death contemplation will reduce, rather than increase, goal directed activity. By employing a goal-regulation perspective on the problem of death, we hypothesized that death awareness precipitates withdrawal from the goal for continued life when life is experienced as dissatisfying and hope for the future appears bleak. In Study 1, participants with low life satisfaction who contemplated goal failure responded to mortality salience with reduced desire for continued life. Studies 2–4 examined general goal motivation. Consistent with the idea that withdrawal from life precipitates a general state of reduced goal motivation, parallel effects were observed on the willingness to delay gratification for future outcomes (Study 2), orientation toward the future (Study 3), and behavioral activation system ({BAS}) sensitivity (Study 4). Moreover, Study 3 showed that these effects were mediated by a generally pessimistic attitude toward life. Finally, Study 5 assessed felt uncertainty and state depression, revealing that withdrawal from life was associated with reduced uncertainty but increased depression. Discussion is focused on implications for theories of threat and defense, and applications for understanding depression and suicide.

569,To be or not to be: How ethnic/racial stereotypes influence ethnic/racial disidentification and psychological mood,"Objectives: The current study explores disidentification. Ethnic/racial disidentification is defined as psychological distancing from a threatened social identity to preserve a positive sense of self. The first study goal was to explore how daily ethnic/racial stereotype appraisal is related to ethnic/racial disidentification. The second goal was explore the association between disidentification and psychological mood. In both cases, centrality and private regard were considered individual differences that might moderate daily associations. Method: Ethnic/racial minority young adults (Mage = 20.63 years, {SD} = 1.49; N = 129) completed a 21-day daily diary, including ethnic/racial stereotype appraisal, ethnic/racial disidentification, and mood. At the end of the study, participants completed measures of ethnic/racial centrality and private regard. Results: The effect of daily stereotype appraisal on disidentification depended on feelings of centrality and private regard. Young adults reporting high centrality and high private regard reported higher disidentification on days on which they reported more stereotype appraisal. These same young adults also reported higher negative mood on days on which they reported disidentification. Young adults reporting high private regard reported less positive mood on days on which they reported disidentification, whereas those reporting low private regard reported more positive mood. Conclusion: This article discusses the role of ethnic/racial disidentification as a normative negotiation of threats to ethnic/racial identity development. For young adults who report high levels of centrality and private regard, daily encounters with ethnic/racial stereotypes are associated with more disidentification, but that disidentification comes at a cost in the form of more negative daily mood.

570,'It's the End of the World as We Know It': Threat and the Spatial-Symbolic Self,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 86(2) of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (see record [rid]2007-16903-001[/rid]). The article contained two errors. On page 35, second column, line 14, two of the word fragments are notated incorrectly. The word shown as s[k]ull should be sk[u]ll, and the word shown as as[h]es should be as[h]e[s].] According to amoebic self theory, the boundary defining the self encompasses 3 levels of self-representation--bodily, social, and spatial-symbolic. Study 1 related a newly developed measure of individual differences in sensitivity to boundary threat across these 3 domains to values and disgust sensitivity. Four subsequent studies focused on spatial-symbolic threat sensitivity and related it to right-wing authoritarianism, aversive reactions to unfamiliar out-groups, and revulsion to vermin. A final experiment illustrates how a salient spatial-symbolic threat (dust mites) can elicit reactions toward out-groups that closely parallel mortality salience effects observed in research inspired by terror management theory, even though dust mites do not elicit mortality concerns. The importance of preserving the familiar in order to preserve the self is discussed.

571,Smearing the opposition: Implicit and explicit stigmatization of the 2008 {US} Presidential candidates and the current {US} President,"Four studies investigated whether political allegiance and salience of outgroup membership contribute to the phenomenon of acceptance of false, stigmatizing information (smears) about political candidates. Studies 1–3 were conducted in the month prior to the 2008 U.S. Presidential election and together demonstrated that pre-standing opposition to John {McCain} or Barack Obama, as well as the situational salience of differentiating social categories (i.e., for Obama, race; for {McCain}, age), contributed to the implicit activation and explicit endorsement of smearing labels (i.e., Obama is Muslim; {McCain} is senile). The influence of salient differentiating categories on smear acceptance was particularly pronounced among politically undecided individuals. Study 4 clarified that social category differences heighten smear acceptance, even if the salient category is semantically unrelated to the smearing label, showing that, approximately 1 year after the election, the salience of race amplified belief that Obama is a socialist among undecided people and {McCain} supporters. Taken together, these findings suggest that, at both implicit and explicit cognitive levels, social category differences and political allegiance contribute to acceptance of smears against political candidates.

572,Mortality salience decreases social exploration when people experience metacognitive ease generating examples of cultural value adherence,"In the present research, we integrated terror management theory with work on metacognitive fluency to examine how mortality concerns affect social exploration motives. We hypothesized that mortality salience would decrease desire to explore novel social interactions only when the feeling of being valued by culturally relevant others was secure. Participants (N = 328) reflected on death or physical pain, then generated 3 (metacognitive-ease) or 12 (metacognitive-difficulty) examples of past behaviors that their peers valued (vs. neutral behaviors). Metacognitive fluency was expected to enhance feelings that existing social bonds were secure. Finally, we assessed participants’ desire to explore novel social interactions. Death thoughts decreased participants’ desire to explore novel social interactions when they experienced 'ease' generating examples of culturally valued behavior.

573,Seeking understanding or sending bombs: Beliefs as predictors of responses to terrorism,"A major question for many Americans following the terrorist attacks of September 11 was how best to respond to the attacks. This study considers some of the primary responses being discussed at the time, and individual differences in beliefs as predictors of support for those responses. Five hundred four undergraduate students indicated their level of endorsement for sending aid to Afghanistan, seeking understanding, increased surveillance and detention, attacking terrorists, and the use of military force. Right-wing authoritarianism emerged as a significant predictor of support for 4 of the 5 responses. Religious fundamentalism, belief in a just world, powerlessness, and universal-diverse orientation were each also significantly related to support for several of the responses to terrorism.

574,Pancultural self-enhancement,"The culture movement challenged the universality of the self-enhancement motive by proposing that the motive is pervasive in individualistic cultures (the West) but absent in collectivistic cultures (the East). The present research posited that Westerners and Easterners use different tactics to achieve the same goal: positive self-regard. Study 1 tested participants from differing cultural backgrounds (the United States vs. Japan), and Study 2 tested participants of differing self-construals (independent vs. interdependent). Americans and independents self-enhanced on individualistic attributes, whereas Japanese and interdependents self-enhanced on collectivistic attributes. Independents regarded individualistic attributes, whereas interdependents regarded collectivistic attributes, as personally important. Attribute importance mediated self-enhancement. Regardless of cultural background or self-construal, people self-enhance on personally important dimensions. Self-enhancement is a universal human motive.

575,"It’s not me, it’s not you, it’s us! An empirical examination of relational attributions","It has recently been suggested that attribution theory expand its locus of causality dimension beyond internal and external attributions to include relational (i.e., interpersonal) attributions (Eberly, Holley, Johnson, \& Mitchell, 2011). The current investigation was designed to empirically focus on relationship dynamics, specifically where 1 member of the relationship receives negative performance-related feedback. We use quantitative and qualitative data from 7 samples (5 samples for scale validation in Study 1 and 2 for hypothesis testing in Studies 2 and 3) that provide empirical support for the existence and impact of relational attributions. Our findings identify the circumstances under which relational attributions are likely to be formed and indicate that relational attributions are related to relational improvement behaviors, particularly when employees are of the same sex as their relationship partner and perceive sufficient time and energy to engage in relational improvement efforts. A personal attribute, relational self, contrary to expectations, did not moderate the link between relational attributions and improvement behaviors. These findings make an important contribution to attribution theory by providing evidence for the criticality of relational attributions within interdependent work relationships.

576,Is memory enhanced by the context or survival threats? A quantitative and qualitative review on the survival processing paradigm,"Consistent with an evolutionary perspective, memory may be enhanced when people are in precarious situations. Particularly, a survival processing effect ({SPE}) has been found whereby people have better memory for a list of items when the items are rated for their relevance in a grassland context that contains survival threats including predators, and the lack of food and water. In this article, we systematically review research that investigated the {SPE} to disentangle the contextual effects (e.g., grassland) from survival effects (e.g., presence of predators) on memory. A total of 56 articles (106 experiments) that reported findings relating to the {SPE} before January 2016 were identified and reviewed. Ten experiments assessed the contextual effect and 5 experiments assessed survival effects. Meta-analysis showed that both contextual and survival effects made medium contributions to improved memory, with survival effect having a greater overall effect compared to contextual effect. Based on a further qualitative review on the scenarios used in the experiments, we concluded that grassland contexts per se may have a weaker effect relative to the presence of survival threat in generating mnemonic advantage. The remaining articles consist of experiments that did not examine contextual or survival effects specifically. These set of findings support the notion that the improved memory for {SPE} largely stems from survival threat because of the lack of survival threat in the control conditions.

578,"Religiousness/spirituality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer: Cultural integration for health research and intervention","Objective: Recently, behavioral scientists have developed greater interest in understanding the relations between religiousness and spirituality (R/S) and health. Our objectives were to (a) provide an overview of the R/S and health literature specific to cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) and cancer, (b) discuss the importance of religious culture considerations to behavioral medicine research, (c) suggest methodological changes to advance this research toward greater depth of understanding, and (d) begin discussion on clinically appropriate ways to integrate R/S into treatment. Method: Individual studies and meta-analyses on the relations of R/S with {CVD} and cancer were reviewed along with articles on the importance of culture to understanding R/S phenomena. Results: Trends in the literature suggest that R/S predicts reductions in all-cause and {CVD}-related but not cancer mortality. R/S also shows relations with cardiovascular morbidity, and various dimensions of R/S show relations with cancer risk factors and well-being in cancer patients. Investigators have progressively studied more specific dimensions of R/S but have largely failed to consider them within religious cultural contexts. This context is essential for a deeper understanding of R/S and health relations and has profound methodological implications for future studies. Conclusions: R/S and health research is expanding; yet, the field needs more programmatic research and greater theoretical organization. We propose that consideration of R/S variables within their religious culture will provide structure for greater integrative understanding to move the field forward. This understanding is imperative if R/S is to be appropriately integrated into culturally sensitive clinical interventions.

579,The effect of mortality salience on death penalty sentencing decisions when the defendant is severely mentally ill,"Purpose: Mortality is a salient factor during capital sentencing. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role death plays in jurors’ decisions when sentencing a severely mentally ill defendant who is subject to possible discrimination in a capital trial because of that status. Design/methodology/approach: The current experiment measured venire jurors’ (n = 133) mental illness dangerousness beliefs, and then experimentally manipulated type of mortality salience (dual-focused: participants who contemplated their own mortality and were exposed to trial-related death references vs trial focused: only exposed to death references) and the type of defendant (severely mentally ill vs neutral) accused of a capital offense. Findings: Mock jurors perceived mental illness to be an important mitigating factor when dual (i.e. self) focused mortality ({DFM}) salience was induced, whereas participants only exposed to trial-related death references considered mental illness to be an aggravating factor in sentencing and were more likely to evidence stereotype adherence toward the defendant. Practical implications: The implications of the authors’ findings are problematic for the current legal system. During the majority of capital sentencing, jurors will only be exposed to trial-related death references, as individuals in the trial-focused mortality condition were. The findings suggest that these jurors are likely to engage in discriminatory stereotypes that do not consider fair process when making sentencing decisions. This research also suggests that mortality salience may be able to increase jurors’ attention to such concerns in a trial scenario even when negative mental illness stereotypes are present. Originality/value: Research builds on existing terror management theory and offers a more nuanced perspective of how focusing on one’s own death can affect jurors’ reliance on stereotypes and lead to inappropriate decisions. Mortality salience can lead to decisions based upon procedural fairness when stereotypes and mortality salience are both present.

The aim of this study was to explore the explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) attitudes toward people with disabilities by family members of persons with disabilities. Research Method: To do so, we analyzed secondary data from 180,701 family members, comparing their explicit and implicit disability attitudes and examining correlates with attitudes. Results: Findings from our study suggest that although family members do not consciously believe they have negative attitudes, they unconsciously prefer nondisabled people. Conclusion: More work is necessary to reduce prominent and systemic negative attitudes about disability as most family members still had negative attitudes about people with disabilities.

581,Social comparison as a predictor of body dissatisfaction: A meta-analytic review,"The relationship between social comparison and body dissatisfaction was examined using meta-analysis. Several demographic and methodological variables were examined as potential moderators. Data from 156 studies (189 effect sizes) showed that social comparison was related to higher levels of body dissatisfaction. The effect for social comparison and body dissatisfaction was stronger for women than men and inversely related to age. This effect was stronger when social comparison was directly measured rather than inferred. No differences emerged for the presence of eating psychopathology, study design, or object of comparison. Results confirm theory and research suggesting that comparing oneself unfavorably to another on the basis of appearance may lead to dissatisfaction with one’s own appearance. Moderator variables refine our understanding of the social comparison–body dissatisfaction relationship. These constructs and their relationship should be explored further in future studies.

Although highly relevant to multiculturalism, {TMT} has been rarely tested in a European multicultural society. To fill this void, two studies examined the effects of mortality salience ({MS}) among native Dutch people with varying levels of national identification and self-esteem. Consistent with {TMT}, {MS} led to less favorable attitudes about Muslims and multiculturalism among participants with high (rather than low) national identification and low (rather than high) self-esteem (Study 1). Likewise, {MS} led participants with high national identification and low self-esteem to increase their support of Sinterklaas, a traditional Dutch festivity with purported racist elements (Study 2). Together, these findings indicate that existential concerns may fuel resistance against multiculturalism, especially among people with low self-esteem who strongly identify with their nationality.

583,The true self and existential structure? Unexpected effects of mortality salience and personal need for structure on belief in a true self,"Two studies examined (what seemed to be) a relatively straightforward prediction that mortality salience would increase belief in a true self. This hypothesis was based on existing evidence that the idea of a true self helps people organize the world as well as evidence suggesting that people are particularly likely to rely on such organizing structures when death is salient. We further hypothesized that this effect would be pronounced for individuals high in personal need for structure ({PNS}). However, our results revealed a pattern in the opposite direction as predicted. While {PNS} did moderate the effect of mortality salience on belief in a true self, high {PNS} individuals were actually less likely to derogate the author of an essay suggesting the true self is an illusion (Study 1) and less likely to endorse items assessing explicit belief in the true self (Study 2) following {MS}. These findings contradict existing theory and evidence and suggest an interesting potential avenue for future research.

584,Mortality salience effects on reckless driving intentions in a motorcyclist sample: The moderating role of group riding,"Campaigns against reckless driving often mention the risk of dying. Research on terror management theory indicates that death claims may backfire and foster reckless driving. Here, we studied such mortality salience effects in a motorcyclist sample. Two moderating variables, particularly interesting regarding the sample of motorcyclists, were considered: group riding (vs. riding alone) and driving‐related self‐esteem. Motorcyclists were exposed to a campaign, either highlighting mortality or not. Orthogonally, cyclists were primed with riding in a group (vs. riding alone). Driving‐related self‐esteem was assessed via a questionnaire. We predicted that reminders of riding in a group would buffer against ironic mortality effects. Supporting this hypothesis, mortality salience effects interacted with the group prime. The results indicate that death appeals are likely to backfire with cyclists riding alone rather than cyclists riding in a group, especially if motorcycling is relevant to the self.

585,Mortality salience and cultural cringe: The Australian way of responding to thoughts of death,"Terror Management Theory predicts that mortality salience ({MS}) instigates cultural worldview defenses, especially among individuals with lower self-esteem. That {MS} intensifies positive evaluations of pro-U.S. essay authors, and negative evaluations of anti-U.S. essay authors have been documented as supportive evidence. However, the evidence to date may have been limited to where praising for the former and rejection of the latter authors is consistent with a shared cultural script and thus normative. In the case of Australian people, the cultural script of cringe prescribes them to evaluate their country modestly and to reject high praise of their country. We therefore predicted that {MS} (vs. control) should lead Australians, with low self-esteem in particular, to evaluate pro-Australia essay authors less positively while not affecting their evaluations of anti-Australia essay authors. Results from two studies were consistent with this prediction. It is important to distinguish {MS} effects on adherence to cultural norms from those on reaffirming collective self-esteem, and to consider relevant cultural scripts when interpreting evidence for worldview defenses.

587,For God (or) country: The hydraulic relation between government instability and belief in religious sources of control,"It has been recently proposed that people can flexibly rely on sources of control that are both internal and external to the self to satisfy the need to believe that their world is under control (i.e., that events do not unfold randomly or haphazardly). Consistent with this, past research demonstrates that, when personal control is threatened, people defend external systems of control, such as God and government. This theoretical perspective also suggests that belief in God and support for governmental systems, although seemingly disparate, will exhibit a hydraulic relationship with one another. Using both experimental and longitudinal designs in Eastern and Western cultures, the authors demonstrate that experimental manipulations or naturally occurring events (e.g., electoral instability) that lower faith in one of these external systems (e.g., the government) lead to subsequent increases in faith in the other (e.g., God). In addition, mediation and moderation analyses suggest that specific concerns with order and structure underlie these hydraulic effects. Implications for the psychological, sociocultural, and sociopolitical underpinnings of religious faith, as well as system justification theory, are discussed.

588,Attributions of responsibility and perceived harm in the aftermath of mass violence,"Two studies shed light on construals (i.e., attributions of responsibility and perceived severity of harm) of extreme intergroup violence and the relationship between in-group identification and these construals. An investigation of Turkish construals of Armenian massacres at the beginning of the 20th century (Study 1) and Hutus' and Tutsis' construals of the ethnic conflict in Burundi (Study 2) showed that each group attributed less responsibility to the in-group relative to the out-group and third parties. Furthermore, respondents attributed less responsibility to the in-group for the instigation of the conflict than for the consequences of the conflict and viewed respective out-groups and third parties as the instigators of the violent conflict. Stronger Turkish identification was related to (a) attributing more out-group responsibility but less in-group responsibility, and (b) greater perceptions of harm inflicted on the in-group and less harm inflicted on the out-group and third parties. Stronger in-group identification among Hutus and Tutsis also predicted more out-group responsibility for the conflict.

Landau, Meier, and Keefer (2010) proposed that conceptual metaphors facilitate social cognition by allowing people to use knowledge from a relatively concrete (source) domain (e.g., physical distance) in understanding a different, usually more abstract (target) concept (e.g., love). We concur that such a notion of metaphors can greatly enrich the field of social cognition. At the same time, we believe it is important to devote greater theoretical attention to the nature of metaphorical representations in social cognition. We believe that Landau et al. place too much emphasis on sociocognitive metaphors as top-down knowledge structures and pay too little attention to the constraints that shape metaphors from the bottom up. In the present contribution, we highlight important bottom-up constraints, imposed through bodily constraints and social scaffolds. Sociocognitive metaphors do not exist just for mental representation but for action as well. We discuss the relevance of grounding sociocognitive metaphors for broader motivational purposes.

591,We supernaturals: Terror management and people’s ambivalent relationship with nature - Handbook of terror management theory.,"The human condition drives people to draw a line between their own cultural existence, and the natural world, fencing off mortality and uncontrollability, which is intimately associated with the principles of nature and that would otherwise cause them constant despair and paralysis. Departing from this basic terror management analysis of human nature relations, a growing body of research supports the role of buffering existential threat for a deep-rooted ambivalence toward nature. This chapter sketches the ambivalent meanings of nature for humans and how this ambivalence can be explained in terms of terror management theory and related models of human social motivation. It reviews 15 years of empirical, mostly experimental, research on terror management and ambivalence toward nature. This encompasses work on humans' tendency to distance themselves from nature, their denial of randomness and missing purpose in natural processes, (dis-)liking of nature and wilderness, and the impact of personal and collective norms about nature and environmental protection. Finally, the chapter sketches how this research advances the understanding both of terror management processes and of how to foster ecologically responsible attitudes and behavior.

We tested our hypotheses in two studies using time-lagged data with independent measures for behaviors. In study 1, two-wave data comprised of 160 peer-employee dyads supported the proposed relationships of fear of terrorism with well-being and performance and the moderating role of negative affectivity. In study 2, two-wave data from 350 employee-supervisor dyads supported the proposed relationships of perceived threat of terrorism with stress, emotional exhaustion, performance, and {OCBI}. Results supported a moderating role of psychological capital in these relationships. We believe that our research adds meaningfully to the limited research on the effects of terrorism on employees’ well-being and behaviors.

593,When you become a superman: Subliminal exposure to death-related stimuli enhances men’s physical force,"Research based on terror management theory ({TMT}) has consistently found that reminders to individuals about their mortality engender responses aimed at shoring up faith in their cultural belief system. Previous studies have focused on the critical role that the accessibility of death-related thought plays in these effects. Moreover, it has been shown that these effects occur even when death-related stimuli are presented without awareness, suggesting the unconscious effects of mortality salience. Because one pervasive cultural ideal for men is to be strong, we hypothesized that priming death-related stimuli would lead to increasing physical force for men, but not for women. Building on self-escape mechanisms from {TMT}, we propose that the mechanism that turns priming of death-related stimuli into physical exertion relies on the co-activation of the self with death-related concepts. To test this hypothesis, we subjected 123 participants to a priming task that enabled us to combine the subliminal priming of death-related words with briefly presented self-related words. Accordingly, three different conditions were created: a (control) condition in which only self-related stimuli were presented, a (priming) condition in which death-related words were subliminally primed but not directly paired with self-related stimuli, and a (priming-plus-self) condition in which death-related words were subliminally primed and immediately linked to self-related stimuli. We recorded handgrip force before and after the manipulations. Results showed that male participants in the priming-plus-self condition had a higher peak force output than the priming and control conditions, while this effect was absent among female participants. These results support the hypothesis that unconscious mortality salience, which is accompanied with self-related stimuli, increases physical force for men but not for women. The gender difference may reflect the cultural belief system, in which individuals are taught that men should be strong. Thus, the unconscious mortality salience produced by exposure to the death-related stimuli motivates need to conform to this internalized cultural standard.

594,Lower levels of resistance to change (but not opposition to equality) is related to analytic cognitive style,"In recent years, there has been increasing research attention to cognitive style differences between liberals and conservatives. While some studies have found a negative relation between conservatism and analytic thinking tendency, others have not observed such a relation. None of these studies has measured the core motives underlying conservative ideology and investigated their relation with analytic cognitive style ({ACS}). We predicted that {ACS} is related to only one of the core motives underlying conservatism (resistance to change), but not the other (opposition to equality). This hypothesis was supported in three non-Western samples (total n = 1,552). This finding may clarify why some studies found a relation between cognitive style and conservatism, while others did not.

595,"Promoting intergroup contact by changing beliefs: Group malleability, intergroup anxiety, and contact motivation","Intergroup contact plays a crucial role in moderating long-term conflicts. Unfortunately, the motivation to make contact with outgroup members is usually very low in such conflicts. We hypothesized that one limiting factor is the belief that groups cannot change, which leads to increased intergroup anxiety and decreased contact motivation. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated beliefs about group malleability in the context of the conflict between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and then assessed intergroup anxiety and motivation to engage in intergroup contact. Turkish Cypriots who were led to believe that groups can change (with no mention of the specific groups involved) reported lower levels of intergroup anxiety and higher motivation to interact and communicate with Greek Cypriots in the future, compared with those who were led to believe that groups cannot change. This effect of group malleability manipulation on contact motivation was mediated by intergroup anxiety.

596,Self-esteem and relationship satisfaction during the transition to motherhood,"In the current study, we used 5 waves of longitudinal data from a large representative sample of Norwegian mothers (N = 84,711) to examine the association between romantic relationship satisfaction and self-esteem before and after childbirth in subgroups of first-, second-, third-, and fourth-time mothers. Maternal self-esteem showed a highly similar change pattern across subgroups. Specifically, self-esteem decreased during pregnancy, increased until the child was 6 months old, and then gradually decreased over the following years. The replication of this trajectory across subgroups and pregnancies suggests that this is a normative change pattern. For relationship satisfaction, the birth of the first child seemed to have the strongest impact compared with the birth of subsequent children. In first-time mothers, relationship satisfaction was high during pregnancy, sharply decreased around childbirth, and then gradually decreased in the following years. In second-, third-, and fourth-time mothers, the decrease in relationship satisfaction after childbirth was more gradual and linear compared with the sharp decrease found in first-time mothers. Moderate positive correlated changes between self-esteem and relationship satisfaction indicated that these constructs were linked over time. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for theory and future research on self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, and personality–relationship transactions.

597,The pushes and pulls of close relationships: Attachment insecurities and relational ambivalence,"Attachment theorists have emphasized that attachment-anxious individuals are ambivalent in their relational tendencies, wishing to be close to their relationship partners but also fearing rejection. Here we report 6 studies examining the contribution of attachment anxiety and experimentally induced relational contexts (both positive and negative) to explicit and implicit manifestations of (a) attitudinal ambivalence toward a romantic partner and (b) motivational ambivalence with respect to the goals of relational closeness and distance. Attachment-anxious individuals exhibited strong attitudinal ambivalence toward a romantic partner, assessed by both explicit and implicit measures. They also exhibited strong motivational ambivalence regarding closeness (both explicit and implicit), and this motivational conflict was intensified in relational contexts that encouraged either approach or avoidance tendencies. Participants who scored relatively high on avoidant attachment proved to be implicitly ambivalent about distance issues but mainly in negative relational contexts. Several alternative interpretations of the results were considered and ruled out.

598,Job insecurity and job performance: The moderating role of organizational justice and the mediating role of work engagement,"Organizational justice has been shown to play an important role in employees’ affective and performance outcomes particularly in uncertain contexts. In this study, we investigated the interaction effect of job insecurity and organizational justice on employees’ performance, and examined the mediating role of work engagement from the perspective of uncertainty management theory. We used 2-wave data (Study 1) from a sample of 140 Chinese employees and 3-wave data (Study 2) from a sample of 125 Chinese employees to test our hypotheses. In Study 1, we found that when employees perceived low levels of organizational justice, job insecurity was significantly negatively related to job performance. In contrast, we found that job insecurity was not related to job performance when there were high levels of organizational justice. Study 2 again supported the interaction of job insecurity and organizational justice on job performance. Furthermore, it was found that work engagement mediated the interaction effect. The results of the mediated moderation analysis revealed that job insecurity was negatively associated with job performance through work engagement when organizational justice was low.

599,Ego depletion and the strength model of self-control: A meta-analysis,"According to the strength model, self-control is a finite resource that determines capacity for effortful control over dominant responses and, once expended, leads to impaired self-control task performance, known as ego depletion. A meta-analysis of 83 studies tested the effect of ego depletion on task performance and related outcomes, alternative explanations and moderators of the effect, and additional strength model hypotheses. Results revealed a significant effect of ego depletion on self-control task performance. Significant effect sizes were found for ego depletion on effort, perceived difficulty, negative affect, subjective fatigue, and blood glucose levels. Small, nonsignificant effects were found for positive affect and self-efficacy. Moderator analyses indicated minimal variation in the effect across sphere of depleting and dependent task, frequently used depleting and dependent tasks, presentation of tasks as single or separate experiments, type of dependent measure and control condition task, and source laboratory. The effect size was moderated by depleting task duration, task presentation by the same or different experimenters, intertask interim period, dependent task complexity, and use of dependent tasks in the choice and volition and cognitive spheres. Motivational incentives, training on self-control tasks, and glucose supplementation promoted better self-control in ego-depleted samples. Expecting further acts of self-control exacerbated the effect. Findings provide preliminary support for the ego-depletion effect and strength model hypotheses. Support for motivation and fatigue as alternative explanations for ego depletion indicate a need to integrate the strength model with other theories. Findings provide impetus for future investigation testing additional hypotheses and mechanisms of the ego-depletion effect.

600,Optimizing assurance: The risk regulation system in relationships,"A model of risk regulation is proposed to explain how people balance the goal of seeking closeness to a romantic partner against the opposing goal of minimizing the likelihood and pain of rejection. The central premise is that confidence in a partner's positive regard and caring allows people to risk seeking dependence and connectedness. The risk regulation system consists of 3 interconnected 'if-then' contingency rules, 1 cognitive, 1 affective, and 1 behavioral. The authors describe how general perceptions of a partner's regard structure the sensitivity of these 3 'if-then' rules in risky relationship situations. The authors then describe the consequences of such situated 'if-then' rules for relationship well-being and conclude by integrating other theoretical perspectives and outlining future research directions.

601,Mental simulation and meaning in life,"Mental simulation, the process of self-projection into alternate temporal, spatial, social, or hypothetical realities is a distinctively human capacity. Numerous lines of research also suggest that the tendency for mental simulation is associated with enhanced meaning. The present research tests this association specifically examining the relationship between two forms of simulation (temporal and spatial) and meaning in life. Study 1 uses neuroimaging to demonstrate that enhanced connectivity in the medial temporal lobe network, a subnetwork of the brain’s default network implicated in prospection and retrospection, correlates with self-reported meaning in life. Study 2 demonstrates that experimentally inducing people to think about the past or future versus the present enhances self-reported meaning in life, through the generation of more meaningful events. Study 3 demonstrates that experimentally inducing people to think specifically versus generally about the past or future enhances self-reported meaning in life. Study 4 turns to spatial simulation to demonstrate that experimentally inducing people to think specifically about an alternate spatial location (from the present location) increases meaning derived from this simulation compared to thinking generally about another location or specifically about one’s present location. Study 5 demonstrates that experimentally inducing people to think about an alternate spatial location versus one’s present location enhances meaning in life, through meaning derived from this simulation. Study 6 demonstrates that simply asking people to imagine completing a measure of meaning in life in an alternate location compared with asking them to do so in their present location enhances reports of meaning. This research sheds light on an important determinant of meaning in life and suggests that undirected mental simulation benefits psychological well-being.

602,Like a horse and carriage? The dynamic interplay of attachment and sexuality during relationship development,"Sexual urges and emotional attachments are not necessarily interrelated. Still, within romantic relationships, intimates typically function as both attachment figures and sexual partners, such that the attachment and sexual systems may influence one another. The present article reviews the reciprocal relation between these two systems. Specifically, previous studies have demonstrated the contribution of attachment processes to the appraisal of sexual interactions in adolescence and adulthood. Other studies have considered the reverse causal direction, focusing on the function of sex as a promoter of emotional bonds and on the circumstances under which this function is more pronounced. In doing so, some of these studies have investigated the role of attachment processes in linking sexuality with relationship quality and in shaping sexual responses to relationship-threatening events. More research is needed to explore the dual potential of sex as a relationship maintenance mechanism and as a force motivating people to pursue alternative partners.

603,Vicarious annihilation: The effect of mortality salience on perceptions of hate crimes,"Previous research has found that reminding participants of their mortality creates a need for individuals to maintain and defend subjective cultural worldviews. As a result, mortality salient participants typically strive to uphold legal sanctions and also react negatively to individuals who espouse alternative worldview beliefs, exhibiting behaviors toward those targets ranging from verbal derogation to physical aggression. This paper extends this line of research by examining perceptions of hate crimes. Hate crimes represent a unique class of crime where both the perpetrator and victim may be viewed as worldview violators. Study 1, with 23 female undergraduates, revealed that mortality salient participants were more supportive of hate crime legislation than were control participants when hate crimes were described in abstract terms and no specific victim was mentioned. In Study 2, with 136 undergraduates, a specific victim who posed a potential worldview threat was identified. In this case, mortality salient participants were less punitive toward offenders who attacked these specific worldview-threatening victims.

604,The importance of being we: Human nature and intergroup relations,"The author discusses the nature of in-group bias and the social motives that underlie ethnocentric attachment to one's own membership groups. Two common assumptions about in-group bias are challenged: that in-group positivity necessitates out-group derogation and that ingroup bias is motivated by self-enhancement. A review of relevant theory and research on intergroup relations provides evidence for 3 alternative principles: (a) in-group attachment and positivity are primary and independent of out-groups, (b) security motives (belonging and distinctiveness) underlie universal in-group favoritism, and (c) attitudes toward out-groups vary as a function of intergroup relationships and associated threats to belonging and distinctiveness.

605,The Lvov-Warsaw School: The forgotten tradition of historical psychology,"This article is an attempt to reconstruct the psychological achievements of the representatives of the Lvov-Warsaw School of historical psychology, virtually forgotten and unknown in the world’s psychological literature. Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938), founder of the school, developed a philosophical and psychological program on the basis of (among other things) the theory of actions and products, including the research program that is now included in the thread of historical psychology. His student, Wladyslaw Witwicki (1878–1948), developed the cratism theory (the theory of power) on the basis Twardowski’s assumptions, providing an alternative to Alfred Adler’s theory of striving for superiority while also declaring it a few years before Adler. The consequence of Witwicki’s theory and the methodological assumptions was the creation of psychobiography: the first nonpsychoanalytical psychobiography of Socrates (Witwicki, 1909, 1922) and the psychobiography of Jesus Christ (Witwicki, 1958). The school’s activities weakened for political reasons, particularly the outbreak of the First World War. The members of the school dispersed after 1918, and they lost international connections with the world of science. Their significant achievements in the field of psychology remained unknown to psychologists for nearly a century. In this article, I would like to present the school’s unique but unfinished program of reconstructing mental life through the psychological interpretation of cultural products (literature, arts, diaries), and its value for the practice of research in historical psychology. This program required additional development, but because of the war this never happened. Some of the school’s theoretical findings and the first attempts to apply them have still significant value and show us the originality of Lvov-Warsaw School psychology.

606,Is death really the worm at the core? Converging evidence that worldview threat increases death-thought accessibility,"According to terror management theory, if the cultural worldview protects people from thoughts about death, then weakening this structure should increase death-thought accessibility ({DTA}). Five studies tested this {DTA} hypothesis. Study 1 showed that threatening Canadian participants' cultural values (vs. those of another culture) increased {DTA} on a word-fragment completion task. Study 2 showed that when participants could dismiss the threat, {DTA} remained low. Study 3 replicated the results of Study 1, but {DTA} was measured using a lexical decision task. Response latencies to death, negative, and neutral content were measured. Worldview threat increased {DTA} relative to accessibility for negative and neutral content. Study 4 showed that the {DTA} effect emerged independently of the arousal of anger or anxiety. Finally, Study 5 demonstrated that participants with a pro-creation (vs. pro-evolution) worldview had higher {DTA} after reading an anti-creation article. Discussion focused on theoretical implications and directions for further research.

This study aimed to clarify whether there was a difference in levels of self-objectification among female participants who viewed objectifying images of women, body-competent images of women, or product-only images. A sample of undergraduate females was primed with one of the above image types, after which they completed the Twenty Statements Test ({TST}) to examine their preoccupation with their own appearance. Results revealed that those who were primed with objectifying images of women exhibited more self-objectification than women who were primed with either body-competent images of women or product-only images. There was also no significant difference between those who only viewed products and those who viewed body-competent images of women. Results are discussed in the context of self-objectification research methods and implications for visual media artists.

608,Being accepted for who we are: Evidence that social validation of the intrinsic self reduces general defensiveness,"Three studies examined the possibility that being liked intrinsically by others—for who one is—reduces self-esteem defense, whereas being liked for what one has achieved does not. All 3 studies contrasted the effects on self-esteem defense of liking based on intrinsic or achievement-related aspects of self. Study 1 showed that thoughts of being liked intrinsically reduced defensive bias toward downward social comparison. Study 2 demonstrated that being liked for intrinsic aspects of self reduced participants' tendency to defensively distance themselves from a negatively portrayed other. Study 3 revealed that being liked for intrinsic aspects of self encouraged a preference for upward over downward counterfactuals for a negative event. In all 3 studies, similar reductions in defensiveness were not found when liking was based on achievements. Discussion focuses on implications for understanding the functional value of different bases of self-worth.

609,"Self-affirmation attenuates death-thought accessibility after mortality salience, but not among a high post-traumatic stress sample","Objective: According to anxiety buffer disruption theory ({ABDT}), people function effectively in the world, in part, by relying on anxiety-buffer systems to protect against death awareness; however, traumatic experiences can overwhelm and disrupt those anxiety-buffer systems, leaving people unprotected from death awareness and at increased risk for the major symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). Based on that idea, it was hypothesized that (a) when posttraumatic stress symptoms are low, self-affirmation (a known worldview/self-esteem based anxiety-buffer) should prevent mortality reminders from causing increased death-thought accessibility ({DTA}); but that (b) when posttraumatic stress symptoms are high (indicating anxiety-buffer disruption), self-affirmation should fail to prevent mortality reminders from increasing {DTA}. Method: To test these hypotheses, participants identified in a general population prescreen assessment as 'low posttraumatic-stress symptom' (n = 222) and 'high posttraumatic-stress symptom' (n = 210) were reminded of death (vs. control topic), prompted to engage in a self-affirmation (vs. nonself-affirmation) task, and then asked to complete a standard assessment of death-thought accessibility ({DTA}). Results: The hypotheses were confirmed, revealing that posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with the ineffectiveness of anxiety-buffer system in protecting against increased death awareness. Conclusion: The present findings support of a foundational concept of {ABDT}, and point to new insights about the nature of {PTSD} and its treatment, because failure to manage death awareness is known to cause anxiety and exacerbate anxiety-related disorders (e.g., {PTSD}).

611,The terror management of meaning and growth: How mortality salience affects growth-oriented processes and the meaningfulness of life - Handbook of terror management theory.,"This chapter explores some of the ways that terror management theory ({TMT}) has been used to understand the psychological processes that shape how concerns about personal mortality influence growth-oriented outcomes and the perceived meaningfulness of one's life. It offers insights into what has traditionally been viewed as an antagonistic relationship between death awareness, on the one hand, and psychological flourishing on the other. The chapter provides a brief primer on terror management theory; mortality salience and the perceived meaningfulness of life. Although {TMT} traditionally emphasized the importance of meaningful views of reality provided by investment in cultural worldviews, direct empirical scrutiny of the ways that {MS} affects meaning in life has only recently emerged. The chapter outlines both how reminders of death impact perceptions of meaning in life and how perceived meaning influences dealings with the specter of death. Death concerns drain perceptions of meaning in life but only when wellsprings of meaning are not engaged. When such constructs are secure or readily deployed, people's perceptions of meaning in life remain unscathed after cognitive brushes with death.

612,Social networks and the role of norms in missile nonproliferation policy decisions,"This dissertation addresses the question of whether norms can influence states' decisions on missile nonproliferation policies. It investigates specifically why South Korea, which continued to face an existential threat and moreover anticipated relying on a robust missile capability to address this threat, acceded to the Missile Technology Control Regime ({MTCR})---a decision that very well could have limited, and in fact did limit, South Korea's future missile development. During the same time period (1994-2000), Egypt, which had normalized relations with its erstwhile principal security threat and moreover decided that long-range missiles would not be a central component to its overall military posture, decided that it would not join the {MTCR}. From a security perspective, these decisions appear not to be explained very well by neorealism, and, from an economic interdependence and international institutionalist perspective, also not very well addressed by neoliberalism. Could these decisions, then, be explained partially by norms-driven influences? This study employed multiple theoretic frameworks and research methodologies to answer this question. The analytic framework includes the rationalism-informed neorealist and neoliberal theories, and the constructivist research program. Qualitative analysis (process tracing) was used to compare insights across these three major research programs in international relations. Where the examination into norms could not be informed empirically by constructivism, the research design expanded into social psychology for insights into socialization mechanisms. This research also incorporated insights from social-networks theory, for perspectives on probabilistic formations of social-reference groups and quantified levels of relative influence of the members therein. Beginning with an original mapping of states' shared memberships in intergovernmental organizations, where states can interact socially and politically, and where social structures can develop, this research identified individual members of South Korea's and Egypt's respective per annum and, by extension, core social-reference groups. The result of this combined approach to the study of norms is a novel framework of indicators for where norms are operating and potentially are affecting preferences and behaviors. Further original contributions come from the specific identification of social-reference groups, their members, and those members' relative levels of potential influence. The key findings are that neorealism and neoliberalism, contrary to the initial impressions above, possess respectable explanatory power, with evidence that both South Korea and Egypt acted according to their genuine beliefs on the attendant costs and benefits of {MTCR} membership and on whether they would maximize their utility of finite resources in their pursuit of self-interest---for example, of enhanced security and economic benefits. However, both South Korea and Egypt were influenced in their respective decisions on {MTCR} membership also by norms, both intrinsically and insofar as norms can undergird social structures, general attitudes, and specific preferences that all can shape behavior. Specifically, South Korea was socialized and acculturated to be generally supportive of {MTCR}-related norms, while Egypt was influenced normatively in the opposite direction.

613,When do stereotypes come to mind and when do they color judgment? A goal-based theoretical framework for stereotype activation and application,"The authors describe a theoretical framework for understanding when people interacting with a member of a stereotyped group activate that group's stereotype and apply it to that person. It is proposed that both stereotype activation and stereotype application during interaction depend on the strength of comprehension and self-enhancement goals that can be satisfied by stereotyping one's interaction partner and on the strength of one's motivation to avoid prejudice. The authors explain how these goals can promote and inhibit stereotype activation and application, and describe diverse chronic and situational factors that can influence the intensity of these goals during interaction and, thereby, influence stereotype activation and application. This approach permits integration of a broad range of findings on stereotype activation and application.

614,The dreams of monks: Studies on Chinese Buddhists’ dream content,"The present study is a comparison of dream content between monks and nonreligious respondents, aiming to understand the unconscious of monks, and to further explore the influence of religion on our human mind. The authors interviewed participants to collect dreams and then explored similarities and differences through content analysis. A total of 127 participants reported their dreams, 65 monks and 62 nonreligious respondents. Results suggest a significant difference in dream themes between monks and nonreligious respondents. Compared with nonreligious respondents, there were more 'prediction' and 'revelation' themes in the monks’ dreams. Meanwhile, nonreligious respondents had more 'death dream' and 'others' than monks did. About the characters in the dream, 'divine beings' and 'teachers' appeared more often in the dreams reported by the monks, whereas 'relatives,' 'animals,' and 'dead people' presented more in dreams of nonreligious respondents. There were also significant differences in the emotions expressed in the dreams between the two groups, with monks reporting more peaceful and reverent emotions than nonreligious respondents, as well as less anxiety. About the reaction to the dreams, monks chose 'chanting and praying' more often than nonreligious respondents. The importance of the results was analyzed in relation to the characteristic of Buddhism and the living environment.

615,Dogmatism and mental health: A comparison of the religious and secular,"Religiousness has frequently been found to be associated with higher reported mental health levels than those found in individuals lower in reported religiousness. These results have often been inferred by scholars to mean that secular groups have poorer levels of mental health despite the fact that secular populations have rarely been included in studies. In this study, an ideologically diverse sample of 4,667 respondents was included to determine the relationships among general dogmatism levels, existential dogmatism, religiousness, and 5 indicators of mental health. The sample mainly comprised agnostic, atheist, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, and spiritual nonreligious participants. Statistical analyses indicated that atheistic and theistic groups showed no significant differences on 4 of the 5 mental health indicators. Existential dogmatism and religiousness had similar positive relationships with mental health, but each had weak predictive strengths. The implications of the current study are that secular and religious adherents have similar levels of mental health, which is contrary to expectations based on the previous literature.

616,What's left behind: Identity continuity moderates the effect of nostalgia on well-being and life choices,"Previous research has demonstrated that nostalgia for the past can have positive consequences for individuals' psychological well-being and their perceived ability to cope with challenges in the present (Wildschut, Sedikides, Arndt, \& Routledge, 2006). We propose that this effect is limited to circumstances in which individuals have maintained identity continuity between the past and the present. Support for this moderation hypothesis is obtained in a longitudinal survey (Study 1) and two experiments (Studies 2 and 3) among students entering university. Whereas previously observed positive effects of nostalgia were confirmed when identity continuity had been maintained, feeling nostalgic about the past in the context of lower identity continuity had negative consequences for well-being (Studies 1 and 3), perceived ability to cope with challenges (Studies 1 and 2), and interest in new opportunities (Studies 2 and 3) rather than focusing on familiar experiences (Study 3). Taken together, results indicate that the extent to which individuals view the present as linked to the past has important implications for the outcome of their nostalgia.

617,Mental representations of attachment figures facilitate recovery following upsetting autobiographical memory recall,"A growing literature shows that even the symbolic presence of an attachment figure facilitates the regulation of negative affect triggered by external stressors. Yet, in daily life, pernicious stressors are often internally generated—recalling an upsetting experience reliably increases negative affect, rumination, and susceptibility to physical and psychological health problems. The present research provides the first systematic examination of whether activating the mental representation of an attachment figure enhances the regulation of affect triggered by thinking about upsetting memories. Using 2 different techniques for priming attachment figure representations and 2 types of negative affect measures (explicit and implicit), activating the mental representation of an attachment figure (vs. an acquaintance or stranger) after recalling an upsetting memory enhanced recovery—eliminating the negative effects of the memory recall (Studies 1–3). In contrast, activating the mental representation of an attachment figure before recalling an upsetting memory had no such effect (Studies 1 and 2). Furthermore, activating the mental representation of an attachment figure after thinking about upsetting memories reduced negative thinking in a stream of consciousness task, and the magnitude of the attachment-induced affective recovery effects as assessed with explicit affect measures predicted mental and physical health in daily life (Study 3). Finally, a meta-analysis of the 3 studies (Study 4) showed that the regulatory benefits conferred by the mental representation of an attachment figure were weaker for individuals high on attachment avoidance. The implications of these findings for attachment, emotion regulation, and mental and physical health are discussed.

In Experiment 1, judges recommended especially harsh bonds for a prostitute when mortality was made salient. Experiment 2 replicated this finding with student Ss and demonstrated that it occurs only among Ss with relatively negative attitudes toward prostitution. Experiment 3 demonstrated that mortality salience also leads to larger reward recommendations for a hero who upheld cultural values. Experiments 4 and 5 showed that the mortality salience effect does not result from heightened self-awareness or physiological arousal. Experiment 6 replicated the punishment effect with a different mortality salience manipulation. Implications for the role of fear of death in social behavior are discussed.

619,"Self-esteem is relatively stable late in life: The role of resources in the health, self-regulation, and social domains","A large body of research has documented changes in self-esteem across adulthood and individual-difference correlates thereof. However, little is known about whether people maintain their self-esteem until the end of life and what role key risk factors in the health, cognitive, self-regulatory, and social domains play. To examine these questions, we apply growth modeling to 13-year longitudinal data obtained from by now deceased participants of the Berlin Aging Study (N = 462; age 70–103, M = 86.3 years, {SD} = 8.3; 51\% male). Results revealed that self-esteem, on average, does decline in very old age and close to death, but the amount of typical decline is minor. Health-related constraints and disabilities as well as lower control beliefs and higher loneliness were each associated with lower self-esteem late in life. We obtained initial evidence that some of these associations were stronger among the oldest-old participants. Our results corroborate and extend initial reports that self-esteem is, on average, fairly stable into the last years of life. We discuss possible pathways by which common and often severe late-life challenges may undermine an otherwise relatively robust self-esteem system.

620,Thought-control difficulty motivates structure seeking,"Struggling to control one’s mind can change how the world appears. In prior studies testing the compensatory control theory, reduced control over the external environment motivated the search for perceptual patterns and other forms of structured knowledge, even in remote domains. Going further, the current studies test whether difficulty controlling thoughts similarly predicts structure seeking. As hypothesized, thought-control difficulty positively predicted perceptions of causal connections between remote events (Study 1a) and nonexistent objects in visual noise (Study 1b). This effect was mediated by aversive arousal (Study 2) and caused specifically by thought-control difficulty as distinct from general difficulty (Study 3). Study 4 replicated the effect with a sample of meditators learning to control their thoughts, showing that thought-control difficulty was a powerful predictor of structure seeking. These findings reveal a novel form of motivated perception.

621,Tit for tat in the face of death: The effect of mortality salience on reciprocal behavior,"Research on terror management theory has found evidence that people under mortality salience strive to live up to salient cultural norms and values, such as egalitarianism, pacifism, or helpfulness. A basic and strong internalized norm in most human societies is the norm of reciprocity: People should support those who have supported them, and people should injure those who have injured them, respectively. In two experiments, the authors demonstrate that mortality salience increases adherence to the norm of reciprocity. In Study 1, a favor of a server led to higher tipping after making mortality salient. Study 2 indicated that mortality salience motivated participants to act according to their high dispositional relevance of the norm of negative reciprocity following an unfavorable treatment: Those participants gave less money to a person who had previously refused to help them.

622,A status-enhancement account of overconfidence,"In explaining the prevalence of the overconfident belief that one is better than others, prior work has focused on the motive to maintain high self-esteem, abetted by biases in attention, memory, and cognition. An additional possibility is that overconfidence enhances the person's social status. We tested this status-enhancing account of overconfidence in 6 studies. Studies 1–3 found that overconfidence leads to higher social status in both short- and longer-term groups, using naturalistic and experimental designs. Study 4 applied a Brunswikian lens analysis (Brunswik, 1956) and found that overconfidence leads to a behavioral signature that makes the individual appear competent to others. Studies 5 and 6 measured and experimentally manipulated the desire for status and found that the status motive promotes overconfidence. Together, these studies suggest that people might so often believe they are better than others because it helps them achieve higher social status.

623,Causal evidence that terrorism salience increases authoritarian parenting practices,"The present research experimentally investigated the impact of terrorism salience on authoritarian practices. It was found that terrorist threat cues (induced by reminders of terrorist incidents) had a significant impact upon both attitudes and behaviors regarding authoritarian parenting practices (Studies 1 and 2) as well as their actual occurrence in a real parent-child playing interaction (Study 3). The implications of these findings for the social psychological perspective on threat and parenting style are discussed.

624,Money as an existential anxiety buffer: Exposure to money prevents mortality reminders from leading to increased death thoughts,"In the present work, we investigate the idea that mere reminders of money can serve an existentially soothing function and help people cope with the psychological terror inherent in their knowledge of mortality. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that money cues, at least for some people, activate self-esteem. Given that self-esteem provides protection against mortality concerns, we expect that higher levels of self-esteem activated by reminders of money should reduce or eliminate death-thought accessibility in response to mortality salience. With this work, we aim to extend earlier findings showing that the exposure to money might buffer fear of death, and provide empirical evidence for how and for whom money acts as an unconscious defense against death thoughts. By demonstrating that money helps people to cope with negative feelings evoked by painful mortality thoughts, our work also offers at least a partial answer to the question of why people persist at materialistic values and goals even when such pursuits are associated with negative consequences for well-being in the long term.

625,"Anger, disgust, and presumption of harm as reactions to taboo-breaking behaviors","Three experiments investigated the relationship between the presumption of harm in harmfree violations of creatural norms (taboos) and the moral emotions of anger and disgust. In Experiment 1, participants made a presumption of harm to others from taboo violations, even in conditions described as harmless and not involving other people; this presumption was predicted by anger and not disgust. Experiment 2 manipulated taboo violation and included a cognitive load task to clarify the post hoc nature of presumption of harm. Experiment 3 was similar but more accurately measured presumed harm. In Experiments 2 and 3, only without load was symbolic harm presumed, indicating its post hoc function to justify moral anger, which was not affected by load. In general, manipulations of harmfulness to others predicted moral anger better than moral disgust, whereas manipulations of taboo predicted disgust better. The presumption of harm was found on measures of symbolic rather than actual harm when a choice existed. These studies clarify understanding of the relationship between emotions and their justification when people consider victimless, offensive acts.

626,Perceptions of legal status: Associations with psychosocial experiences among undocumented Latino/a immigrants,"In the present study we used a mixed-method design to examine perceptions of legal status and their association with psychosocial experiences among undocumented Latino/a immigrants in the United States. Participants were asked to compare their perceived social experiences with those of documented Latinos/as in order to determine whether differences in such perceptions might emerge and whether such perceptions might differentially impact well-being. A community sample of 140 self-reported undocumented Latino/a immigrants completed questionnaires measuring perceptions of legal status, well-being (global and psychological), perceived context of reception, and experiences of discrimination. Results indicated that individuals who perceived their experiences as different from those of documented Latinos/as due to an unauthorized legal status reported less social equality as evidenced by lower well-being, increased experiences of discrimination, and a more adverse context of reception. Moreover, individuals who perceived their social experiences as different from those of documented Latinos/as due to their legal status reported issues centering on 2 domains: limited opportunity/restricted social mobility and discrimination/unfair treatment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of advancing theory and from a multicultural counseling perspective.

627,Understanding the limits of limiting instructions: Social psychological explanations for the failures of instructions to disregard pretrial publicity and other inadmissible evidence,"Inadmissible information may come in a variety of forms including pretrial publicity and in-court statements made by witnesses or attorneys. A number of remedies have been proposed for controlling the damaging effects of such evidence. When inadmissible information comes in the form of pretrial publicity, judges may issue a continuance or rely on voir dire to remove biased jurors. In addition, it has been argued that deliberations may serve as an effective remedy. Finally, judges may issue an admonition to disregard pretrial publicity or other inadmissible evidence presented in court. Empirical research has demonstrated that such safeguards are relatively ineffective and sometimes produce a backfire effect, resulting in jurors being more likely to rely on inadmissible information after they have been specifically instructed to disregard it. Several social psychological theories provide explanations for the failures of admonitions, including belief perseverance, the hindsight bias, reactance theory, and the theory of ironic processes of mental control. Existing inadmissible evidence research and relevant social psychological theories are reviewed. The article concludes with a discussion of theoretically based policy recommendations.

628,The dragons of inaction: Psychological barriers that limit climate change mitigation and adaptation,"Most people think climate change and sustainability are important problems, but too few global citizens engaged in high-greenhouse-gas-emitting behavior are engaged in enough mitigating behavior to stem the increasing flow of greenhouse gases and other environmental problems. Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or 'dragons of inaction': limited cognition about the problem, ideological worldviews that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers.

629,The role of oxytocin in terror management processes,"Research on terror management theory found evidence for the idea that attachment and interpersonal touch attenuate existential concerns and worldview defense reactions after mortality salience. Oxytocin, on the other hand, is known for stimulating the attachment system. Therefore, we hypothesized that worldview defense reactions after mortality salience would be attenuated under oxytocin. In the present study, participants administered oxytocin or placebo and performed a typical terror management paradigm: After visualizing death or a control topic, worldview defense reactions were assessed by evaluating the authors of a pro- and an anti-German essay. Overall, the results did not provide strong support for the hypothesis. There was no effect of mortality salience on the overall worldview defense measure and, importantly, no moderation by oxytocin. However, with regard to the sympathy dimension, the expected pattern was revealed: The pro- and anti-German authors were evaluated as more balanced under oxytocin after mortality salience, whereas this was not the case under placebo. This was due to more positive evaluations of the anti-German author in the oxytocin group. Although this specific result was not expected a priori, sympathy was the only trait among all worldview defense variables that referred to a social level. Therefore, it seems possible that oxytocin is able to buffer existential concerns, but only if they are socially relevant.

630,The enduring influence of death on health: Insights from the terror management health model,"The terror management health model suggests targeting sources of self-esteem or identity, in conjunction with mortality salience, offers a pathway for health behavior promotion. To date, however, experimental evidence has been limited to single time point studies. Two studies assessed whether similar processes impact behavior over time. In Study 1, mortality salience was paired with exercise (i.e., riding a recumbent bike); two weeks later, individuals primed with mortality reported more exercise than those not primed with death, and this increased fitness-contingent self-esteem and exercise intentions. In Study 2, when smokers visualized a prototypical unhealthy (vs. typical) smoker after mortality salience, they reported more attempts to quit smoking (over three weeks) than participants not primed with mortality. This facilitated continued quit attempts and decreased smoker identification three weeks later. Implications are discussed for a longitudinal process model in which mortality salience catalyzes a reinforcing relationship between behavior and esteem/identity, potentially sustaining health behavior change over time.

631,A meta-synthesis of studies of patients’ experience of living with terminal cancer,"Objective: The aim of this research was to produce a synthesis of phenomenological studies of the experience of living with the awareness of having terminal cancer to gain a more complete understanding of the parameters of this experience. Methods: This research used meta-synthesis as a method for integrating the results of 23 phenomenological studies of the experience of living with the awareness of having terminal cancer published between 2011 and 2016. Results: The meta-synthesis generated 19 theme clusters that informed the construction of four master themes: trauma, liminality, holding on to life, and life as a cancer patient. Each master theme captures a distinct experiential dimension of living with the awareness of having terminal cancer. Each dimension brings with it significant and distinctive psychological challenges. Conclusion: The results from the present meta-synthesis suggest that the experience of living with the awareness of having terminal cancer is a multidimensional experience that patients actively negotiate as they search for ways in which they can rise to the psychological challenges associated with it. A better understanding of the parameters of this experience can help health care professionals provide appropriate support for this client group.

632,Deconstructing the simplification of jury instructions: How simplifying the features of complexity affects jurors’ application of instructions,"Research consistently shows that techniques currently used to simplify jury instructions do not always improve mock jurors’ comprehension. If improvements are observed, these are limited and overall comprehension remains low. It is unclear, however, why this occurs. It is possible that current simplification techniques do not effectively simplify the features of complexity, present in standardized instructions, which have the greatest effect on jurors’ comprehension. It is not yet known, however, how much each feature of complexity individually affects jurors’ comprehension. To investigate this, the authors used existing data from published empirical studies to examine how simplifying each feature of complexity affects mock jurors’ application of instructions, as jurors can only apply instructions to the extent they understand them. The results suggest that reducing the conceptual complexity and proportion of supplementary information was associated with increased application of the instructions; however, reducing both the linguistic complexity and amount of information, and providing the instructions in a written format was not. In addition, results showed an unexpected adverse effect of simplification—reducing the amount of information was associated with an increase in the punitiveness of mock jurors’ verdicts, independently of the instruction content. Together, these results suggest a need to make jury instructions comprehensible, highlight the key principles in the decision-process, and identify a way to eliminate the negative effect of reducing the amount of information. Addressing these needs is essential for developing a simplification technique that maximizes jurors’ comprehension and application of instructions, while minimizing the previously overlooked negative effects of simplification.

633,Do ableism and ageism predict college students’ willingness to provide care for a family member with a chronic health condition?,"As the U.S. population of older adults with chronic health conditions grows, there will be an increasing number of college-age students who are introduced to informal caregiving responsibilities. Despite the aging of the population, there is a dearth of information regarding college-age caregivers, who are a demographic likely to provide care for their family members with chronic health conditions in the not-too-distant future. The purpose of the current study was to examine the potential influence of ageism and ableism on the willingness to provide care for a family member with a chronic health condition among a sample of undergraduate students (n = 330). Participants completed an online survey measuring these constructs. Ageism and ableism were significantly positively associated. Hierarchal linear regressions found that after controlling for age and ableism, ageism explained 5\% of the variance in willingness to provide emotional care, 4\% in instrumental care, and 5\% in nursing care. Higher affective ageist attitudes were uniquely and inversely associated with willingness to provide emotional (β = −.187), instrumental (β = −.175), and nursing care (β = −.215). Although not significant in the multivariate models, ableism-behavior was inversely associated with instrumental willingness to care in a bivariate manner (r = −.14). These findings suggest that ageism has a potentially powerful influence on the future provision of care for a family member with a chronic health condition. Future research and interventions to identify methods to reduce ageism may lead to later willingness to provide care and improved quality of care toward older adults.

634,Effects of a randomized gratitude intervention on death-related fear of recurrence in breast cancer survivors,"Objective: Among the most prevalent and distressing concerns endorsed by breast cancer survivors is fear of cancer recurrence ({FOR}), and one of the most salient facets is the worry that a recurrence of cancer could cause one’s death. The primary goal of the present study was to test the effects of a brief, low-cost gratitude intervention on overall {FOR} and death-related {FOR}, positing pursuit of meaningful goals as a theoretically driven putative mediator. To replicate published tests of similar gratitude-eliciting interventions, positive affect ({PA}) was also considered as an outcome. Method: Sixty-seven women with early stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to either a 6-week online gratitude intervention or a 6-week online control condition. Outcomes were assessed at pre- and posttreatment, as well as 1 month and 3 months after the end of treatment. The mediator, meaningful goal pursuit, was measured via assessments over the 6-week intervention period. Results: Results revealed that patients in the gratitude intervention experienced a significant decrease in death-related {FOR} compared to the control condition. Moreover, this effect was significantly mediated by meaningful goal pursuit (and not by {PA}). The gratitude intervention was also found to prevent declines in {PA} observed in the control condition. Conclusions: Overall, findings support the notion that a brief gratitude intervention can promote well-being and psychological adaptation to cancer by stimulating the pursuit of meaningful goals and subsequently reducing death-related {FOR}.

A factor analysis performed on the scale's items yielded five factors that identified three basic entitlement-related attitudes toward a romantic partner. Findings indicated that both exaggerated and restricted forms of relational entitlement seem to be maladaptive and put people at risk for emotional problems. Findings also indicated that excessive and restricted forms of relational entitlement were significantly associated with attachment insecurities. In addition, the {SRE} scale was found to tap a unique psychological construct that moderately overlapped with constructs of narcissism and global entitlement.

We posit that interventions to help both older clients and therapists to reflect on their own images of aging may increase the likelihood of successful treatment.

639,Primed interference: The cognitive and behavioral costs of an incongruity between chronic and primed motivational orientations,"Research has shown that temporarily primed motivational orientations have essentially the same effects on how people pursue their goals as their chronic orientations. This article shows that, despite the interchangeability of temporary and chronic motivations, primed motivational orientations that are incongruent with chronic orientations create interference, requiring the deployment of cognitive resources and thus undermining performance on subsequent tasks that rely on these resources. Across 6 studies, we primed motivational orientations that were either congruent or incongruent with participants' chronic orientations and then assessed their performance on subsequent tasks that required cognitive resources. Consistent with the primed interference hypothesis, we found that incongruity between temporary and chronic motivational orientations undermined participants' (a) inhibition of incorrect but highly accessible responses, (b) mental arithmetic, (c) analytical reasoning, and (d) resistance to temptation. These results—which were observed following the activation of motivations for promotion or prevention (Studies 1–2 and 5–6), high or low need for belonging (Study 3), and high or low power orientations (Study 4)—illustrate the broad implications of holding incongruent chronic and primed orientations.

640,A prospective study of risk and resilience factors associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression symptoms among Jews and Arabs exposed to repeated acts of terrorism in Israel,"In the first prospective study, to our knowledge, of the impact of ongoing terrorism and political violence, we analyzed nationally representative data from 560 Jews and 182 Arabs in Israel over a 6-month period. Based on Conservation of Resources ({COR}) theory (Hobfoll, 1989, 1998), we predicted that exposure to terrorism and political violence would result in psychosocial and economic resource loss and resource lack, which in turn, would be primary predictors of increases in symptoms of posttraumatic stress ({PTS}) and depression. We also predicted that trauma exposure and {PTS} symptoms, in particular, would be related to ethnocentrism and support for political violence. Furthermore, based on theory and prior research, we predicted that posttraumatic growth ({PTG}) would be related to a worsening of symptoms of distress and that distress would be related to increased ethnocentrism and support for extreme political violence for their 'cause.' Women, older individuals, and Arabs (compared with Jews) were more likely to have continued psychological distress over time. In addition, using simultaneous equation modeling, we found good fit for a structural model that partially supported our hypotheses. Psychosocial resource loss, {PTG}, and social support had direct and indirect effects on psychological distress. Political attitudes tended to harden over time but were not prospectively related to {PTS} or depressive symptoms.

Pyszczynski, J. Greenberg, S. Solomon, J. Arndt, and J. Schimel's (2004) review offers an imbalanced appraisal of the theories' merits. Many of Pyszczynski et al.'s (2004) criticisms of sociometer theory apply equally to {TMT}. and others are based on misconstruals of the theory or misunderstandings regarding how people respond when rejected. Furthermore, much of their review is only indirectly relevant to {TMT}'s position on the function of self-esteem, and the review fails to acknowledge logical and empirical challenges to {TMT}. A more balanced review suggests that each theory trumps the other in certain respects, both have difficulty explaining all of the evidence regarding self-esteem, and the propositions of each theory can be roughly translated into the concepts of the other. For these reasons, declaring a theoretical winner at this time is premature. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Leary, Mark R.",0,,641

Yet the individuals most responsible for managing such conflicts—heads of state, {CEOs}, intellectual or religious leaders—are often blind to the psychological forces affecting their interests. During 20 years of international research, consulting, and teaching, I have developed a program for teaching thought leaders how to apply psychological principles to achieve their aims while also reducing negative outcomes such as violence, social upheaval, and economic displacement. In this article, I present relational identity theory ({RIT}), a theoretical and intellectual framework I have originated to help people understand and deal with key emotional dimensions of conflict management. I argue that national and communal bonds are essentially tribal in nature, and I describe how a tribe's unaddressed relational identity concerns make it susceptible to what I term the tribes effect, a rigidification of its relational identity. I provide strategies based on {RIT} for mitigating the tribes effect and thus enhancing global security. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Shapiro, Daniel L.",0,,642
643,The attachment system in fledgling relationships: An activating role for attachment anxiety,"Is it sensible to study attachment dynamics between potential romantic partners before they share a full-fledged attachment bond? The present data indicate that such an approach may reveal novel insights about initial attraction processes. Four studies suggest that the state-like experience of attachment anxiety has functional implications within fledgling (i.e., desired or undeveloped) romantic relationships, well before the formation of an attachment bond. Studies 1 and 3 reveal that attachment anxiety directed toward a particular romantic interest is elevated before (in comparison with after) participants report being in an established relationship. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that such partner-specific attachment anxiety predicts attachment-relevant outcomes in fledgling relationships, including proximity seeking, safe haven, secure base, passionate love, and other approach behaviors. These associations were reliable above and beyond (and were typically as strong as or stronger than) the effect of sexual desire. Finally, Study 4 presents evidence that partner-specific attachment anxiety may cause several of these attachment-relevant outcomes. Attachment anxiety seems to be a normative experience and may signal the activation of the attachment system during the earliest stages of romantic relationships.

644,Memory of an outgroup: (Mis)identification of Middle Eastern-looking men in news stories about crime,"This study examined White individuals’ ability to recall non-White criminal perpetrators, specifically Middle Eastern-looking men, as portrayed in news stories. Considering social identity theory and the Arab/Muslim/Middle Eastern terrorist stereotype, White participants were expected to correctly identify White European-looking men and misidentify Middle Eastern-looking men as the perpetrators in news stories. A 2 (race/ethnicity of the perpetrator: White European- or Middle Eastern-looking) × 2 (story type: violent or nonviolent) experiment revealed that correct recall of the perpetrator for Middle Eastern-looking men was lower than that of White European-looking men. However, White individuals were not significantly more likely to incorrectly recall Middle Eastern-looking men than White European-looking men as perpetrators. Regardless of condition, more negative attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims predicted the incorrect recall of both Middle Eastern- and White European-looking men as perpetrators. These results are explained in light of their contradiction of existing theory. Also, a new measure of attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims is recommended.

646,Systemic thinking in couple and family psychology research and practice,"Systemic thinking is central to the specialty of couple and family psychology ({CFP}). Eleven applications of systemic thinking (perceptual and cognitive structuring processes) are described to characterize the way couple and family psychologists think about research and practice. The application of systemic thinking to research is described in light of dynamic systems conceptualization and a systemic research approach that delineates six steps that identify collective variables, characterize attractor states, describe dynamic trajectories, identify points of transition, recognize control parameters, and manipulate control parameters to identify core mechanisms of change is rehearsed and detailed. Systemic thinking is applied to professional practice in {CFP}, recognizing that psychotherapy with multiple individuals concurrently in couple or family formats presents particular challenges. Critical elements of therapeutic process in the specialty, including the therapeutic alliance, assessment and case conceptualization, the understanding of change in systems, and treatment interventions are described in light of systemic thinking and thoughts about professional supervision in the specialty are presented.

647,Dispositional optimism and perceived risk interact to predict intentions to learn genome sequencing results,"Objective: Dispositional optimism and risk perceptions are each associated with health-related behaviors and decisions and other outcomes, but little research has examined how these constructs interact, particularly in consequential health contexts. The predictive validity of risk perceptions for health-related information seeking and intentions may be improved by examining dispositional optimism as a moderator, and by testing alternate types of risk perceptions, such as comparative and experiential risk. Method: Participants (n = 496) had their genomes sequenced as part of a National Institutes of Health pilot cohort study ({ClinSeq}®). Participants completed a cross-sectional baseline survey of various types of risk perceptions and intentions to learn genome sequencing results for differing disease risks (e.g., medically actionable, nonmedically actionable, carrier status) and to use this information to change their lifestyle/health behaviors. Results: Risk perceptions (absolute, comparative, and experiential) were largely unassociated with intentions to learn sequencing results. Dispositional optimism and comparative risk perceptions interacted, however, such that individuals higher in optimism reported greater intentions to learn all 3 types of sequencing results when comparative risk was perceived to be higher than when it was perceived to be lower. This interaction was inconsistent for experiential risk and absent for absolute risk. Independent of perceived risk, participants high in dispositional optimism reported greater interest in learning risks for nonmedically actionable disease and carrier status, and greater intentions to use genome information to change their lifestyle/health behaviors. Conclusions: The relationship between risk perceptions and intentions may depend on how risk perceptions are assessed and on degree of optimism.

648,The psychology of jury decision making in age discrimination claims,"Recently, the Supreme Court decided that discrimination cases under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ({ADEA}) of 1967 (29 U.S.C. §§ 621–634) are distinct from those under Title {VII} of the Civil Rights Act ({CRA}) of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § e2000 et seq.). The {ADEA} must use 'but for' causality instructions (e.g., age must be the direct cause of an adverse outcome), whereas Title {VII} allows mixed-motive instructions (an illegitimate factor need only be a contributory cause). Two simulated jury experiments examined the effect of instruction type in a case in which a plaintiff charged that a company discriminated against him because of his age by demoting him to a lower status job. The first experiment varied whether the facts favored the plaintiff or the defendant, taking into consideration the moderating effect of jurors' chronic regulatory focus. Experiment 1 showed that participants who received 'but for,' as opposed to mixed-motive, instructions found for the defendant, regardless of case valence. Furthermore, jurors weighed less heavily their beliefs that the company made use of the plaintiff's age in the 'but for' causality instruction condition than in the mixed-motive condition. Regulatory focus moderated the effect of instruction type in that the instruction effect was strongest when participants were low in prevention focus. Experiment 2 added an ambiguous fact pattern and replicated the instruction effect, demonstrating that the difference in outcome based on instruction type was not dependent upon extreme fact patterns. Experiment 2 also found evidence for promotion focus effects on verdicts. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Wiener, Richard L. and Farnum, Katlyn S.",0,,648

Drawing upon the state-trait {EI} model and terror management theory, we posited {EI} would be associated with greater {DTA}. Studies 1a and 1b found trait {EI} to be correlated with baseline {DTA}. Evidence for mediation by ingroup identity was mixed. Studies 2 and 3 (a preregistered replication of Study 2) assessed whether priming {EI} would increase {DTA} relative to control primes. Study 2 found support for our hypothesis, but Study 3 failed to replicate, leaving open the question about whether {EI} plays a causal role in higher {DTA}. We discuss the potential value of {EI} for understanding how people manage concerns about death and relate to ingroups.

650,Terror management theory upside down: Prosocial behavior following immortality priming,"Based upon Terror Management Theory, the present study tested whether subliminally priming notions of immortality would tend to cause individuals to increase their generosity and reduce their in-group bias, as measured by monetary donations to racial in-group vs. out-group members, and to what degree that effect was positively associated with individuals' spiritual beliefs and level of collectivism. As part of the study's paradigm, participants had the chance to win \$200 in a lottery-style drawing, and were given the chance to indicate what amount, if they were to win that drawing, they would like to donate (the dependent variable) to a (fictional) scholarship recipient. Prior to allocating that donation, participants were randomly assigned to be subliminally primed with words related to symbolic immortality (vs. controls). Additionally, participants were randomly assigned to condition whereby the donation recipient was of the same vs. different race as the participant. Measures of collectivism and religion also were collected during a survey component of the study. Immortality priming did not significantly reduce in-group bias. However, it strongly interacted with spiritual beliefs such that spiritual believers gave more when primed with immortality. Collectivism was positively associated with amount donated, which tended to be more pronounced both when individuals gave to racial in-group members.

Participants were adults sampled from the general U.S. population (N = 503) using internet-based methods. Psychometric analysis indicates a 13-item version of the {TCS}, measuring three constructs (Rumination, Magnification, and Helplessness), met all tests of scaling assumptions and generally fit a 3-factor model using confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}; {CFI} = 0.96; {TLI} = 0.98), where {CFI} is the comparative fit index and {TLI} is the Tucker-Lewis index. Results also indicate that self-esteem and social connectedness are negatively associated (P {\textless} .0001) with terrorism catastrophizing, as {TMT} would assume. Finally, terrorism catastrophizing is a significant predictor (P {\textless} .0001) of behavioral change and of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and physiological stress, as {CBT} would maintain. The implications and limitations of this study are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Sinclair, Samuel J. and {LoCicero}, Alice",0,,651
652,Selective pressures on the once and future contents of ethnic stereotypes: Effects of the communicability of traits,"It is hypothesized that traits that are most likely to be the subject of social discourse (i.e., most communicable) are most likely to persist in ethnic stereotypes over time and that this effect is moderated by the extent to which an ethnic group is the subject of social discourse. Study 1 yielded communicability ratings of 76 traits. Study 2 tested the relation between a trait's communicability and its presence in stereotypes of 4 Canadian ethnic groups. Study 3 tested the relation between a trait's communicability and its persistence over time in stereotypes of 8 American ethnic groups. Results supported the hypotheses. A communication-based analysis of stereotypes appears helpful in predicting persistence and change in the contents of stereotypes of real groups in the real world.

653,Organizational nostalgia lowers turnover intentions by increasing work meaning: The moderating role of burnout,"We report 3 studies addressing the relevance of organizational nostalgia for the meaning that employees ascribe to their work (work meaning). We hypothesized, and found, that organizational nostalgia enhances work meaning and thereby reduces turnover intentions. In Study 1, an employee survey, spontaneously experienced organizational nostalgia was associated with higher work meaning. In Study 2, an organizational-nostalgia induction increased work meaning, which subsequently predicted lowered turnover intentions. In Study 3, an organizational-nostalgia induction increased work meaning and thereby lowered turnover intentions, especially among employees who reported relatively high levels of burnout. When burnout is high, organizational nostalgia functions as a rich source of meaning that benefits employees’ work experience.

654,Role of consciousness and accessibility of death-related thoughts in mortality salience effects,"On the basis of terror management theory, research has shown that subtle mortality salience inductions engender increased prejudice, nationalism, and intergroup bias. Study 1 replicated this effect (increased preference for a pro-{US} author over an anti-{US} author) and found weaker effects when Ss are led to think more deeply about mortality or about the death of a loved one. Study 2 showed that this effect is not produced by thoughts of non-death-related aversive events. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that this effect occurs only if Ss are distracted from mortality salience before assessment of its effects. Study 4 revealed that although the accessibility of death-related thoughts does not increase immediately after mortality salience, it does increase after Ss are distracted from mortality salience. These findings suggest that mortality salience effects are unique to thoughts of death and occur primarily when such thoughts are highly accessible but outside of consciousness.

655,Beyond self-esteem: Influence of multiple motives on identity construction,"Diverse theories suggest that people are motivated to maintain or enhance feelings of self-esteem, continuity, distinctiveness, belonging, efficacy, and meaning in their identities. Four studies tested the influence of these motives on identity construction, by using a multilevel regression design. Participants perceived as more central those identity elements that provided a greater sense of self-esteem, continuity, distinctiveness, and meaning; this was found for individual, relational, and group levels of identity, among various populations, and by using a prospective design. Motives for belonging and efficacy influenced identity definition indirectly through their direct influences on identity enactment and through their contributions to self-esteem. Participants were happiest about those identity elements that best satisfied motives for self-esteem and efficacy. These findings point to the need for an integrated theory of identity motivation.

However, some research suggests that this conceptualization might be overly simplistic. The present study examined the structure of political orientation in a sample of 190 politicians who were candidates in the 2006 Canadian federal election. Participants completed measures of attitudes toward specific political issues (social conservatism issues, economic competition issues), ideological beliefs (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation), and abstract values (conservation, self-enhancement) as indicators of political orientation. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the structure of political orientation was explained best by 2 moderately correlated dimensions: social left–right and economic left–right. Differences in the political orientation indicators between political parties are also discussed.

657,Terror management and prosocial behavior: A theory of self-protective altruism - The Oxford handbook of prosocial behavior.,"Prosocial behavior poses a dilemma: Responding to a cry for help may compromise self-interest. Acting callously, however, may lead to social disproval. These antagonistic responses are existentialiy meaningful as belongingness and self-esteem have been found to regulate death anxiety. The author critically examines three possible hypotheses concerning the tension between egotism and prosociality from a terror management perspective. The first hypothesis, the carpe diem hypothesis, suggests that when death is salient, egotistic self-interest overrides other-oriented responses. The second hypothesis, the norm salience hypothesis, suggests that when death is salient, people will respond according to the momentarily accessible social norm. The third hypothesis, the self-protective altruism hypothesis, argues that when the prosocial cause reminds people of their fragile, mortal nature, people will turn away from helping when death is salient, but when the prosocial cause is benign, death salience will increase prosocial behavior.

658,Spousal support and cardiac patients' distress: The moderating role of attachment orientation,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(3) of Journal of Family Psychology (see record [rid]2012-14341-003[/rid]). The Brief Symptoms Inventory ({BSI}) which was used (p. 510) ranged from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) and not as reported. Therefore, the averages of the sample’s depression and anxiety symptoms were not higher than the Israeli population norms.] Based on the Person–Environment Fit Model, the current prospective study explored the contribution of the interaction between spouses' ways of providing support and patients' attachment orientations to the patients' levels of psychological distress 6 months after experiencing a first Acute Coronary Syndrome ({ACS}). One hundred and eleven patients completed a measure of attachment orientations during hospitalization, while their spouses completed a measure of ways of providing support 1 month later. The outcome measures were patients' depressive and anxiety symptoms 6 months after their {ACS}. Whereas active engagement was associated with lower levels of anxiety symptoms among patients high in attachment anxiety, it was also associated with higher levels of anxiety symptoms among patients low on this orientation. In addition, none of the ways of providing support moderated the association between avoidance and distress. These results shed light on the possible interplay between providers' support and recipients' personalities.

Multilevel modeling analyses controlling for demographics, mental health history, prior experience with stressful life events, and other key beliefs indicated that benevolence beliefs were positively associated with well-being and that these associations were stronger with increasing age. Analyses also demonstrated that individuals' benevolence beliefs increased during the study, were positively associated with age, and increased with the experience of bereavement, although they declined with the experience of other negative events.

661,Etiology and treatment of post-cumulative traumatic stress disorders in different cultures,"Developments in the theories of identity, culture, and traumatology enrich our cross-cultural understanding of mental health dynamics, case conceptualization, and developing effective intervention models to help victims of complex and cumulative traumas especially in different cultures and minority populations. Identity traumas, along with preidentity and nonidentity traumas, contribute to forming cultures. On the other hand, cultures may contribute to delivering some types of culture- and social-made serious traumatic conditions that can be transferred cross-generationally, such as poverty and caste systems. Most current interventions are designed to help with single trauma and ignore the cumulative trauma dynamics as well the collective identity and culture-specific traumas. This understanding entails revising our culturally limited and single-trauma-based interventions to help clients who belong to different cultures or to minority victims of culture- and social-made traumas as well as those who are victims of cumulative traumas. Multisystemic, multimodal, multicomponent flexible and fiddle therapy models emerged as potentially more effective in the treatment of disorders resulting from cumulative and identity traumas. They are more ecologically valid and culturally competent. Specific models of multisystemic, multimodal therapies—the wraparound psychosocial rehabilitation approach, for torture survivors, and the summer day and after-school treatment, for child victims of cumulative traumas—are discussed.

662,Experiential reframing: A promising new treatment for psychosocial and existential trauma,"Experiential reframing ({ER}) is a therapeutic protocol specifically designed to treat the dysthymia and dysfunctional behavior incident to both chronic psychosocial trauma and more discrete event existential traumas. The protocol is unique among substantially all other trauma therapies in 2 regards: (a) It uses somatosensory or affective association rather than a cognitive search to identify experiences for therapeutic intervention and (b) it uses actual rather than imaginary experiences for resource experiences. Resource experiences are (actual) patient experiences that model appropriate behavior and perspectives and successful coping. The article sets forth the 10 steps of the {ER} process and {ER}’s theoretical grounding in Milton Erickson’s hypnotherapy, equating many of Erickson’s hypnosis techniques with currently common mindfulness and meditation practices. Trauma is conceptualized as the problematic interaction between 2 human learning and memory systems. The reasons behind why traumagenic learning is so resistant to subsequent modification is discussed, along with the manner in which the {ER} process may potentiate resolution of trauma and allow more normal posttreatment learning and memory to obtain. The reasons why {ER}’s unique features are critical to its clinical success are discussed.

663,Dyadic effects of attachment on mental health: Couples in a postdisaster context,"Research on mental health following disasters has led to the identification of many individual protective and risk factors for postdisaster mental health. However, there is little understanding of the exact influence that disasters have on the functioning of intimate relationships. Especially relevant are attachment styles, which are likely to play an important role in the provision and perception of social support between partners, and subsequent mental health outcomes. Heterosexual couples (N = 127) affected by the 2009 Victorian 'Black Saturday' Bushfires in southeastern Australia were surveyed for disaster experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) symptoms, depression, and attachment style between May 2012 and January 2013, approximately 3 years after the disaster. Using actor–partner interdependence models ({APIM}), we examined both intrapersonal and interpersonal associations of attachment anxiety and avoidance with depression and {PTSD}, in combination with shared disaster exposure. Male partners’ attachment avoidance was associated with depression and {PTSD} in both partners. By contrast, a female partner’s attachment avoidance was associated with greater depression and {PTSD} in herself, but fewer {PTSD} symptoms in a male partner. Amid the chronic stressors of a postdisaster setting, the attachment avoidance of the male partner may play a particularly negative role, with his tendency toward isolation and denial becoming especially maladaptive for the couple as a whole. The female partner’s attachment avoidance is likewise an important factor, but its associations with negative social support and relationship breakup must be clarified to understand its impact on partnership functioning.

664,Death and end times: The effects of religious fundamentalism and mortality salience on apocalyptic beliefs,"According to terror management theory, the awareness of death motivates people to subscribe to cultural worldviews that offer some form of death transcendence. In support of this assertion, studies reveal that stimuli that heighten the awareness of death (mortality salience) increase investment in and defense of cultural worldviews (e.g., religion). Although past research has elucidated different forms of mortality salience-induced religious worldview defense, no study to date has considered how death-awareness contributes to apocalyptic beliefs derived from religious prophecy. The present research indicates that individual differences in religious fundamentalism interact with mortality salience to influence religious apocalyptic beliefs. For people higher in religious fundamentalism, mortality salience increased apocalyptic beliefs. For people lower in religious fundamentalism, mortality salience decreased apocalyptic beliefs.

665,Intrinsic religiosity protects believers from the existential fear of a human Jesus,"The present study examined the role of internalised religious beliefs in defending against existential concerns aroused from a creaturely Jesus. Prior work has found that biologically human traits (e.g., vomiting, sweating, etc.) can increase death concerns when applied to both humans and a god. Intrinsic beliefs, however, have been shown to reduce mortality awareness. In the current study, religious participants were primed with thoughts of either a human or neutral Jesus followed by a single item measure about fear of death. A moderated regression analysis found that whereas high intrinsic individuals were buffered from existential concerns, low intrinsic individuals experienced a greater fear of death when primed with a human Jesus. These results replicate prior work within terror management theory and the psychology of religion suggesting that internalised beliefs serve a protective function against existential anxieties.

Contrary to social identity and social justice findings of an in-group bias, the present study snowed greater support at all institutions for the voting rights of the African Americans than for the rural farmers, and the greatest support for both minority groups was found at the {HBU}. Perceived evidence strength was a better predictor of decisions than perceived unfairness, and both of these predictor variables completely mediated the effects of institution-type and involvement of a racially-defined group on decisions.

The authors thus proposed that highly disgust-sensitive individuals would be particularly repelled by exposure to transgressors and, consequently, would think and behave in ways aimed at reducing the risk of such exposure occurring--a syndrome the authors call moral hypervigilance. To examine these ideas, the authors began in Study 1 by testing the notion that people are disgusted by moral deviants. Evidence was found that participants exposed to descriptions of criminals experienced disgust. Across 2 further studies, disgust sensitivity ({DS}) was found to be associated with phenomena indicative of moral hypervigilance. In Study 2, mock jurors high on {DS} were biased toward conviction. In Study 3, {DS} predicted several hypothesized outcomes: higher estimates of the probability that suspects described in crime vignettes were culpable; a proclivity to attribute evilness to, and recommend lengthy sentences for, criminals; and inflated perceptions of community crime levels.

669,Moral judgment and the brain: The role of the frontal lobes and the moderating influence of mortality salience and type of moral dilemma on moral judgment,"Moral psychology has been an area of study advanced by philosophers and political scientists for the most part of its history. Although various psychological attempts have been made to study moral decision-making and development, mainly by Piaget and Kohlberg, nonetheless morality as a topic remained at the fringes of psychology. The last 20 years saw the development of moral psychological theories that were informed by the latest neuropsychological developments of brain translational recording technologies. Specifically, two theories appeared: the social intuitive theory and the dual processing theory. The current study sought to investigate the validity of the dual processing theory utilizing {EEG} technology, while also introducing mortality reminders as an experimental condition affecting moral judgment. The current study used a mixed factorial within-between cross-over experimental design wherein all participants were initially quasi-randomly assigned to a group were they were first presented with the push or switch moral dilemma and then, after the introduction of a prime, were given the other dilemma (e.g., push group did switch dilemma; switch group did push dilemma). All participants received both moral dilemma conditions. In the case of the prime, there were two prime conditions- mortality salience and neutral conditions. Participants were quasi-randomly assigned to a prime condition. The dependent/outcome variables were type of moral judgment, moral reasoning, and brain activity operationalized in terms of absolute power across all spectral frequencies measured. The results of the current study showed small support for the existence of two types of moral judgments (deontological vs. utilitarian) in response to two different types of moral dilemmas (personal vs. impersonal). However, the study did not find support for the assertion that utilitarian judgments were moderated by increased activity in the {DLPFC}, while the deontological judgments were moderated by increased activity in the {VMPFC}. The study also did not find support for the effect of heightened anxiety induced via mortality salience on types of moral judgments. Implication for these results, limitations, and directions for future research are further discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Jaber, Adnan",0,,669
670,When self-destructive thoughts flash through the mind: Failure to meet standards affects the accessibility of suicide-related thoughts,"When individuals realize that they fail to attain important standards or expectations, they may be motivated to escape the self, which could lead thoughts of suicide to become more accessible. Six studies examined this hypothesis, mainly derived from escape theory (Baumeister, 1990). The results indicated that whenever individuals realize that they fail to attain an important standard, they experience increased accessibility of suicide-related thoughts (Studies 1–6). In line with the idea that such effects reflect motivations to escape from negative self-awareness, they were especially pronounced when associated with high levels of self-consciousness and escapist motivations (Study 1) and with a large discrepancy between self and standards (Studies 2–4). Moreover, failure to attain standards increased suicide-thought accessibility along with the desire for an altered state of consciousness (Study 5). Finally, increases in suicide-thought accessibility after failure were associated with simultaneous increases in accessibility of general concepts related to escape (Study 6). Implications of these findings for escape and terror management theories are discussed.

This current volume, Evolution, culture and the human mind, follows the lead of Wundt where an attempt is made to provide a synthesis of theory and data across psychological subfields into a holistic framework. Norenzayan, Schaller, and Heine begin the volume with an overview of the scope and themes that arose from their 2004 conference at the University of British Columbia on 'Mind, Culture and Evolution.' Explicit throughout this volume is an effort to bridge the 'yawning chasm' between perspectives of evolutionary determinism and cultural constructionism. In doing so, there is interest in providing a rigorous multidisciplinary scientific effort to solve this foundational problem for psychology. As such this volume provides an interesting and insightful examination of the evolution of consciousness, cognition, decision-making, actions, and cultural norms in terms of collective consequences and genetic mechanisms. The volume is divided into three sections where several dialectical themes (theory/data, top-down/bottom-up, ecological/social, diversification/integration) are woven throughout. Overall the volume offers nice flow from one collection of essays to the next as themes are picked up and let go, only to return later on. This volume shows a dominance of natural science (cross-cultural) inclinations where some readers may call for more voice given to phenomenological and hermeneutical (cultural) human science contributions. Other critics may challenge the reliance upon correlational, comparative, and post hoc data to bolster claims of causality in support of various theoretical suppositions.

672,From a terror management perspective: The efficacy of self-affirmation on organ donation-related thoughts and intentions in china,"In 2015, the Chinese government officially abolished the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners. However, the voluntary donor registration rate among the Chinese population is approximately 2\% as of January 2020. Guided by self-affirmation theory and terror management theory, the present investigation examined a number of variables that may be related to donor registration intentions and a method to mitigate death thoughts and misconceptions. An online experiment was conducted in which 352 Chinese participants were randomly assigned to either a self-affirmation (i.e., affirming values that are important to the participants) or a no-affirmation condition. Results revealed that self-affirmation lowered death thoughts among the participants, which in turn were positively related to organ donation misperceptions. Inconsistent with terror management theory, the level of death thoughts was not directly related to participants’ intentions to register as organ donors.

Participants were divided into four groups. Two of the groups received death-related themes: one wrote an essay about dying and the other group heard a song about men who died in a shipwreck. The other two groups received pain-related stimuli: one wrote an essay about dental pain and the other heard a song about a migrant worker’s painful separation from family. Dependent variables examined pro-social behavior, ranking one’s country, children, and emotions. Results showed similar effects for the mortality-stimulating essay and the disaster song on two variables: ranking one’s country in the world and the importance of having children. In addition, compared to the pain-of-separation song, the disaster song produced significantly more negative and less positive emotion ratings; the emotion ratings of the essay groups did not differ significantly. Results show that a disaster song can produce effects similar to those that have been observed for a mortality-stimulating essay. Further, the effects of disaster songs may extend to strengthening cultural worldview defenses.

674,The evil animal: A terror management theory perspective on the human tendency to kill animals,"This research tested whether support for the killing of animals serves a terror management function. In five studies, death primes caused participants to support the killing of animals more than control primes, unless the participants’ self-esteem had been elevated (Study 4). This effect was not moderated by gender, preexisting attitudes toward killing animals or animal rights, perceived human–animal similarity, religiosity, political orientation, or by the degree to which the killing was justified. Support for killing animals after subliminal death primes was also associated with an increased sense of power and invulnerability (Study 5). Implications and future directions are discussed.

675,Making sense of the meaning literature: An integrative review of meaning making and its effects on adjustment to stressful life events,"Interest in meaning and meaning making in the context of stressful life events continues to grow, but research is hampered by conceptual and methodological limitations. Drawing on current theories, the author first presents an integrated model of meaning making. This model distinguishes between the constructs of global and situational meaning and between 'meaning-making efforts' and 'meaning made,' and it elaborates subconstructs within these constructs. Using this model, the author reviews the empirical research regarding meaning in the context of adjustment to stressful events, outlining what has been established to date and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current empirical work. Results suggest that theory on meaning and meaning making has developed apace, but empirical research has failed to keep up with these developments, creating a significant gap between the rich but abstract theories and empirical tests of them. Given current empirical findings, some aspects of the meaning-making model appear to be well supported but others are not, and the quality of meaning-making efforts and meanings made may be at least as important as their quantity. This article concludes with specific suggestions for future research. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Park, Crystal L.",0,,675
676,"Priming states of mind can affect disclosure of threatening self-information: Effects of self-affirmation, mortality salience, and attachment orientations","Interviewers often face respondents reluctant to disclose sensitive, embarrassing or potentially damaging information. We explored effects of priming 5 states of mind on willingness to disclose: including 2 expected to facilitate disclosure (self-affirmation, attachment security), and 3 expected to inhibit disclosure (self-disaffirmation, attachment insecurity, mortality salience). Israeli Jewish participants completed a survey including a manipulation of 1 of these states of mind, followed by questions concerning hostile thoughts and behaviors toward the Israeli Arab outgroup, past minor criminal behaviors, and socially undesirable traits and behaviors. Self-affirmation led to more disclosures of all undesirable behaviors than neutral priming, whereas self-disaffirmation led to less disclosures. Mortality salience led to fewer disclosures of socially undesirable and criminal behaviors compared to neutral priming, but more disclosures of hostile thoughts and behaviors toward Israeli Arabs. Security priming facilitated disclosure of hostile attitudes toward Israeli Arabs. However, neither security nor insecurity priming had any other significant effects.

In addition, the baton of Editor-in-Chief has passed from Hans-Peter Erb to me – a responsibility that I assume with great humility, as the journal has thrived within the last 2 years. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Hans-Peter Erb and his assistant Deborah Thoben for all the work they invested to make Social Psychology such a prospering journal.

679,Initial and noninitial name-letter preferences as obtained through repeated letter rating tasks continue to reflect (different aspects of) self-esteem,"We tested the usefulness of name-letter preference scores as indirect indicators of self-esteem by exploring whether multiple unsupervised self-administrations of letter rating tasks within a short period of time yield useful data. We also examined whether preferences for initials and noninitial name-letters tap different aspects of self-esteem. Participants from a community sample (N = 164; 58 men and 106 women, 17–67 years, Mage = 34.57, {SD} = 13.28) completed daily letter rating tasks and state self-esteem questionnaires for 7 consecutive days. They also completed a trait self-esteem questionnaire on the first measurement day as well as 6 months later. Preference scores for first-name initials were stronger but more unstable than preference scores for other name-letters. Preferences for first-name initials were primarily associated with directly measured state self-esteem whereas preferences for noninitials were primarily associated with directly measured trait self-esteem even if the latter was measured 6 months later. Thus, we showed that preferences for initials and noninitials are not simply interchangeable. Previous letter rating studies, which almost exclusively used initial preferences, should be interpreted in terms of state rather than trait self-esteem. In future studies, researchers should focus on the name-letter preference that reflects the aspect of self-esteem they wish to address.

Pyszczynski, J. Greenberg, S. Solomon, J. Arndt, \& J. Schimel, 2004). the authors focus on the convergence on certain points regarding self-esteem as a way of progressing toward an integrative perspective. In doing so, they briefly discuss how the need for self-esteem relates to anxiety, interpersonal relations, growth, evolution, and death. They also discuss sources of self-esteem, whether the pursuit of self-esteem is good or bad, and whether such a pursuit could fruitfully be abandoned. They conclude that self-esteem buffers anxiety, is greatly influenced by social relations, and can either facilitate or undermine growth and that the value of the pursuit of self-esteem depends on the sources on which it is based but that its pursuit is too inextricably woven into the way people manage their anxieties and regulate their behavior to ever be abandoned.

681,Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks,"Pargament's (1997) religious coping theory was used to examine the methods of coping with stressful interpersonal events experienced by 138 Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks. The large majority of participants reported experiencing at least one stressful interpersonal event after the 9/11 attacks related to being Muslim; the most common incidents were hearing anti-Muslim comments, undergoing special security checks in airports, facing discriminatory acts, and being verbally harassed. Participants used both religious (i.e., positive religious coping, negative religious coping) and nonreligious (i.e., reaching out, isolation) methods to deal with these stressful interpersonal events. Positive religious coping and reaching out were related to posttraumatic growth; negative religious coping was associated with depression; and isolation was tied to both depression and angry feelings. The large majority of participants did not view the negative interpersonal events they experienced after the 9/11 attacks as a sacred loss, but a significant percentage did consider these events as a desecration. Further, viewing these incidents as a desecration was tied to posttraumatic growth, but this link was partially mediated by positive coping methods.

682,When nonsense sounds happy or helpless: The Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test ({IPANAT}),"This article introduces an instrument for the indirect assessment of positive and negative affect, the Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test ({IPANAT}). This test draws on participant ratings of the extent to which artificial words subjectively convey various emotions. Factor analyses of these ratings yielded two independent factors that can be interpreted as implicit positive and negative affect. The corresponding scales show adequate internal consistency, test–retest reliability, stability (Study 1), and construct validity (Study 2). Studies 3 and 4 demonstrate that the {IPANAT} also measures state variance. Finally, Study 5 provides criterion-based validity by demonstrating that correlations between implicit affect and explicit affect are higher under conditions of spontaneous responding than under conditions of reflective responding to explicit affect scales. The present findings suggest that the {IPANAT} is a reliable and valid measure with a straightforward application procedure.

683,Coping flexibility and trauma: The Perceived Ability to Cope With Trauma ({PACT}) scale,"Theories about coping with potential trauma have emphasized the importance of concerted focus on processing the traumatic event. However, empirical evidence also suggests that it may be salubrious to distract oneself, remain optimistic, and focus on moving past the event. These seemingly contradictory perspectives are integrated in the concept of coping flexibility. This investigation reports the development and validation of a brief questionnaire, the Perceived Ability to Cope With Trauma ({PACT}) scale, with 2 scales that measure the perceived ability to focus on processing the trauma (trauma focus) and to focus on moving beyond the trauma (forward focus). In addition, we created a single flexibility score that represented the ability to use both types of coping. Participants included an Israeli sample with potential high trauma exposure and a sample of American college students. The factor structure of the {PACT} was confirmed in both samples. Preliminary evidence was obtained for the {PACT}'s convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. Both the Forward Focus and Trauma Focus scales were independently associated with better adjustment, and each scale independently moderated the impact of heightened trauma exposure. Similarly, the combination of these scales into a single parsimonious flexibility score also moderated trauma exposure. Limitations of and future research with the measure are considered.

684,"Terror management, crime, and law - Denying death: An interdisciplinary approach to terror management theory.","As the nature of this volume attests, underlying concerns about mortality potently impact people's efforts to maintain, and live up to, cultural standards of value in ways that affect diverse areas of social life. Terror management theory ({TMT}) provides an integrative conceptual vehicle that predicts and explains these relationships, and offers key insights into the dynamics of the human existential condition. In this chapter, the application of {TMT} to the legal arena is examined. Given the influence of people's awareness of mortality on culturally valued behavior, {TMT} is inherently relevant to understanding legal transgressions and judgments because the law provides a codified articulation of society's morals and values. Thus, {TMT} has the potential to contribute a unique perspective when trying to understand how and why people engage in lawful or unlawful behavior, as well as how individuals react to, adjudicate, and punish criminal offenses.

The Relationship Between Social and Physical Pain,"The authors forward the hypothesis that social exclusion is experienced as painful because reactions to rejection are mediated by aspects of the physical pain system. The authors begin by presenting the theory that overlap between social and physical pain was an evolutionary development to aid social animals in responding to threats to inclusion. The authors then review evidence showing that humans demonstrate convergence between the 2 types of pain in thought, emotion, and behavior, and demonstrate, primarily through nonhuman animal research, that social and physical pain share common physiological mechanisms. Finally, the authors explore the implications of social pain theory for rejection-elicited aggression and physical pain disorders.

686,Validation and revision of a German version of the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs Scale,"In this study we tested the psychometric properties of a German version of the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs scale ({BMNP}; Sheldon \& Hilpert, 2012), a questionnaire to assess the degree of fulfillment of the three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In Study 1, 251 participants completed this questionnaire, as well as measures of life satisfaction, self-esteem, depression, loneliness, and personality traits via online assessment. Results indicate that a six-dimensional structure fit the data adequately well. Furthermore, all three needs independently predicted life satisfaction and depression over and above personality traits. Self-esteem was only predicted by relatedness satisfaction and competence dissatisfaction, and loneliness was only predicted by relatedness. In Study 2, we revised the {BMPN} by replacing one item and largely replicated the results obtained in Study 1. Study 3 showed that the subscales of the {BMPN} are only moderately stable over 1 week supporting the assumption of the {BMPN} being a state measure. Together, these results suggest that the revised German version of the {BMPN} is a reliable and valid measure to assess satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

687,Uncertainty management: The influence of uncertainty salience on reactions to perceived procedural fairness,"On the basis of fairness heuristic theory, it is argued in this article that people especially need fairness when they are reminded about aspects of their lives that make them uncertain. It is therefore proposed that thinking about uncertainty should make fairness a more important issue to people. The findings of 3 experiments support this line of reasoning: Asking (vs. not asking) participants 2 questions that solicited their thoughts and feelings of being uncertain led to stronger effects of perceived procedural fairness on participants' affective reactions toward the way they were treated. It is argued that these findings suggest that fairness matters to people especially when they are trying to deal with things that make them uncertain. An implication of the current findings therefore may be that fairness is important to people because it gives them an opportunity to manage uncertain aspects of their lives.

The article contained an error in the running head. The corrected running head is provided in the erratum.] Appreciation is an audience response associated with entertainment portrayals concerned with the meaning of life and human existence. Appreciation has been shown to be conceptually and empirically different from enjoyment, which is characterized as pleasure and fun. Drawing upon terror management theory, this research investigates first the influence of reminders of one’s own death on appreciation and enjoyment of a meaningful film and second, the influence of the search for meaning in one’s life on these outcomes. Results of an experimental study (N = 60) showed that mortality salience increased appreciation of a meaningful film, but only for those who rated highly for search for meaning in life. Concerning enjoyment, a reverse pattern was found: Participants who intensely search for meaning in their lives enjoyed the film when their own mortality had not been made salient before watching.

689,Existential therapies: A meta-analysis of their effects on psychological outcomes,"Objective: To review the evidence on the efficacy of different types of existential therapies: a family of psychological interventions that draw on themes from existential philosophy to help clients address such issues in their lives as meaning and death anxiety. Method: Relevant electronic databases, journals, and reference lists were searched for eligible studies. Effects on meaning, psychopathology (anxiety and depression), self-efficacy, and physical well-being were extracted from each publication or obtained directly from its authors. All types of existential therapy for adult samples were included. Weighted pooled mean effects were calculated and analyses performed assuming fixed-effects model. Results: Twenty-one eligible randomized controlled trials of existential therapy were found, from which 15 studies with unique data were included, comprising a total of 1,792 participants. Meaning therapies (n = 6 studies) showed large effects on positive meaning in life immediately postintervention (d = 0.65) and at follow-up (d = 0.57), and had moderate effects on psychopathology (d = 0.47) and self-efficacy (d = 0.48) at postintervention; they did not have significant effects on self-reported physical well-being (n = 1 study). Supportive-expressive therapy (n = 5) had small effects at posttreatment and follow-up on psychopathology (d = 0.20, 0.18, respectively); effects on self-efficacy and self-reported physical well-being were not significant (n = 1 and n = 4, respectively). Experiential-existential (n = 2) and cognitive-existential therapies (n = 1) had no significant effects. Conclusion: Despite the small number and low quality of studies, some existential therapies appear beneficial for certain populations. We found particular support for structured interventions incorporating psychoeducation, exercises, and discussing meaning in life directly and positively with physically ill patients. It is important to study more precisely which existential intervention works the best for which individual client.

691,Implicit death primes increase alcohol consumption,"Objective: The authors examined whether priming thoughts of death are associated with increases in alcohol consumption. Method: Research assistants handed out fliers that were stacked in a random order to pedestrians walking through campus (N = 377). These fliers served to remind them of either their death or of an aversive condition unrelated to death (severe back pain), which served as the control. Then they were solicited to purchase an alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverage. Results: The authors used a 2 × 2 log-linear analysis, with type of prime (death–pain) and beverage type (alcoholic–nonalcoholic) as the independent variables and consumption (yes–no) as the outcome measure (11.9\% of the total sample consumed a beverage). Results revealed that a greater percentage of students who received the death prime consumed alcohol (36.59\%) versus students in the pain prime condition (8.94\%), G²(4, N = 377) = 64.8, p {\textless} .001, W = .41. The type of prime (death–pain) did not influence the consumption of nonalcoholic beverages. Conclusion: The current research indicates that death-related concerns may play a role in increasing the consumption of alcoholic beverages.

692,Stepping back to see the big picture: When obstacles elicit global processing,"Can obstacles prompt people to look at the 'big picture' and open up their minds? Do the cognitive effects of obstacles extend beyond the tasks with which they interfere? These questions were addressed in 6 studies involving both physical and nonphysical obstacles and different measures of global versus local processing styles. Perceptual scope increased after participants solved anagrams in the presence, rather than the absence, of an auditory obstacle (random words played in the background; Study 1), particularly among individuals low in volatility (i.e., those who are inclined to stay engaged and finish what they do; Study 4). It also increased immediately after participants encountered a physical obstacle while navigating a maze (Study 3A) and when compared with doing nothing (Study 3B). Conceptual scope increased after participants solved anagrams while hearing random numbers framed as an 'obstacle to overcome' rather than a 'distraction to ignore' (Study 2) and after participants navigated a maze with a physical obstacle, compared with a maze without a physical obstacle, but only when trait (Study 5) or state (Study 6) volatility was low. Results suggest that obstacles trigger an 'if obstacle, then start global processing' response, primarily when people are inclined to stay engaged and finish ongoing activities. Implications for dealing with life's obstacles and related research are discussed.

A 2-process model of psychological needs is outlined, viewing needs as evolved functional systems that provide both (a) innate psychosocial motives that tend to impel adaptive behavior and (b) innate experiential requirements that when met reinforce adaptive behavior and promote mental health. The literature is reviewed to find support for 8 hypotheses derived from this model: that certain basic psychosocial motives are present at birth; that successful enactment of these motives supports the functioning and wellness of all humans; that individual differences in these motives develop in childhood; that these strong motive dispositions tend to produce the satisfying experiences they seek; that motive dispositions do not moderate the effect of motive-corresponding need satisfaction on well-being but do moderate the effect of assigned goal-type on rated self-concordance for those goals; that need dissatisfaction and need satisfaction correspond to the separable behavioral-motive and experiential-reward aspects of needs; and that motives and needs can become decoupled when chronic dissatisfaction of particular requirements warps or depresses the corresponding motives, such that the adaptive process fails in its function. Implications for self-determination theory and motive disposition theory are considered. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Sheldon, Kennon M.",0,,693

We conducted an exploratory study to examine whether the ability to sketch engaging fictional characters is influenced by a writer’s attributes. Samples of 93 creative writers and 114 nonwriters generated character descriptions based on a portrait photograph. We measured participants’ experiences with reading and writing in various genres, their trait personality, their self-reported perspective-taking tendencies, and cognitive accessibility of social information. Next, 144 raters read these sketches and assessed the characters for interest, likability, and complexity. Characters produced by creative writers were rated as more interesting and complex, though not more likable, than were those produced by nonwriters. Participants who wrote more fiction and poetry and read more poetry, and those who scored high on Openness to Experience, sketched characters that were more interesting and complex. Moreover, Openness mediated the relationships between fiction-writing and poetry-reading and how Interesting characters were. Participants with higher levels of perspective-taking produced characters that were more complex, however, those for whom social information was cognitively more accessible tended to create characters who were less likable. These findings suggest that there is a measurable influence of individual differences on the ability to develop compelling fictional characters during creative writing.

695,Environmental contingency in life history strategies: The influence of mortality and socioeconomic status on reproductive timing,"Why do some people have children early, whereas others delay reproduction? By considering the trade-offs between using one's resources for reproduction versus other tasks, the evolutionary framework of life history theory predicts that reproductive timing should be influenced by mortality and resource scarcity. A series of experiments examined how mortality cues influenced the desire to have children sooner rather than later. The effects of mortality depended critically on whether people grew up in a relatively resource-scarce or resource-plentiful environment. For individuals growing up relatively poor, mortality cues produced a desire to reproduce sooner—to want children now, even at the cost of furthering one's education or career. Conversely, for individuals growing up relatively wealthy, mortality cues produced a desire to delay reproduction—to further one's education or career before starting a family. Overall, mortality cues appear to shift individuals into different life history strategies as a function of childhood socioeconomic status, suggesting important implications for how environmental factors can influence fertility and family size.

Three studies reported here support the hypothesis that changes in self-reported negative emotion may be detected more sensitively when discrete emotions are measured rather than by either {PANAS} {NA} or a measure created by combining discrete emotions, and when participants were instructed to report how they felt during an emotion-eliciting event versus how they felt afterward. In Study 1, emotion was manipulated with disgusting photographs, in Study 2, with recall of social exclusion/inclusion, and in Study 3, with reminders of personal mortality. Discussion focuses on implications for detecting emotional changes in psychological research, and the inadvisability of interpreting null results on an insensitive measure as indicating that emotional changes did not occur.

In each of two successive years, three measures of gender identity (felt gender typicality, contentment with gender assignment, and felt pressure for gender conformity) and four measures of adjustment (self-esteem, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and acceptance by peers) were collected. Low gender typicality, low gender contentedness, and high felt pressure all foreshadowed deterioration on one or more indexes of adjustment. The combination of low gender typicality with high felt pressure was especially conducive to internalizing problems, underscoring the importance of the cognitive organization of the gender identity variables. The advantages of a multidimensional perspective on gender identity are discussed.

699,Terror management theory and the impact of individual and collective mortality salience on symbolic and literal immortality beliefs,"According to Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), many human behaviors, attitudes, and thoughts are the result of an attempt to reduce the uncomfortable feelings associated with the knowledge that human life is finite. Although many of {TMT}'s postulates have been supported by research, the assumption that an underlying desire for literal or symbolic immortality is partly responsible for mortality salience responses has received less research attention. Additionally, there has been little research investigating the possibility that different forms of mortality salience may be associated with different behavioral, emotional, and cognitive reactions. The first study examined views of having children (a form of symbolic immortality) as a function of Individual mortality salience (increased awareness of one's own death), Collective mortality salience, (increased awareness of the deaths of others), or no mortality salience. Overall, results from Study 1 did not support the theory that different forms of mortality salience would result in different responses to questions about parenthood desirability. In partial support of predictions, however, participants in the individual mortality salience condition did report an increased sense of urgency to have children compared to those in the control condition. The second study examined views on religion, spirituality, and the possibility of an afterlife (a form of literal immortality) as a function of individual, collective, or no mortality salience. In contrast to predictions, the mortality salience inductions had no effect on self-reported measures of religion, spirituality, and opinions about an afterlife—thereby offering little support for the theory that mortality salience increases religiosity and spirituality. Study 2 also did not support the hypothesis regarding different reactions to different mortality salience types, as individual and collective mortality salience conditions produced virtually identical results. The third study examined the possibility that thinking about one's children prior to experiencing increased death awareness would moderate the mortality salience effect. Although this prediction was not supported, the results did support previous research demonstrating a tendency for highly neurotic individuals to be more responsive to mortality salience inductions.

700,Collective sense-making in times of crisis: Connecting terror management theory with Twitter user reactions to the Berlin terrorist attack,"Recent terrorist attacks have increased the need to examine the public's response to such threats. This study focuses on the content of Twitter messages related to the 2016 terrorist attack on the Berlin Christmas market. We complement the collective sense-making perspective with the terror management theory ({TMT}) perspective to understand why people used Twitter in the aftermath of the attack. We use structural topic modeling to analyze our dataset of 51,000 tweets. Our results indicate that people used Twitter to make sense of the events and as part of typical reactions in {TMT}, that is, to validate their own worldviews and maintain their self-esteem. In accordance with {TMT}, we found that people used Twitter to search for meaning and value, show sympathy for victims and their families, or call for tolerance, but also to express nationalistic sentiment and greater hostility toward values and views other than their own. We further show that topics varied over the course of the attack and in the days that followed. Whereas in the first two days there were many emotion-related tweets and operational updates, subsequent days saw more opinion-related tweets. Our findings contribute to the literature on collective behavior in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.

701,The power of presence: The role of mindfulness at work for daily levels and change trajectories of psychological detachment and sleep quality,"In this research, we examined the role of mindfulness for recovery from work using a daily diary design (N = 121; 5 days; 3 measurement occasions per day). The first goal of the study was to investigate the relationship of mindfulness with sleep quality and the mediating role of psychological detachment from a day-level perspective. A second goal was to extend the process perspective in recovery research beyond the day level and consider systematic change trajectories in recovery variables over the course of the work week and the role of mindfulness in these trajectories. Results regarding day-level relationships confirmed that mindfulness experienced during work was related to subsequent sleep quality, and this relationship was mediated by psychological detachment from work in the evening. Furthermore, an investigation of the role of mindfulness in recovery change trajectories supported the idea that psychological detachment trajectories increase over the work week for individuals low on mindfulness while there was no systematic mean-level change for individuals high on mindfulness. In contrast, sleep quality followed a linear increase from Monday to Friday for all individuals, irrespective of their levels of trait mindfulness. Practical and theoretical implications for the mindfulness and the recovery literature are discussed in conclusion.

702,"Shared possible selves, other-focus, and perceived wellness of couples with prostate cancer","Shared possible selves are associated with better well-being in couples through their engagement in and enjoyment of collaboration (Schindler, Berg, Butler, Fortenberry, \& Wiebe, 2010). The present study sought to address which partner’s other-focus accounted for this sharedness in possible selves and how the individual and dyadic configurations of other-focused selves relate to health and well-being (i.e., perceived wellness) in an important health context for adult couples—prostate cancer. Sixty-one men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their wives rated their own subjective physical health and well-being and listed possible selves. Possible selves were reliably coded for the inclusion of the other (i.e., other-focus), either with the other as the subject or communal in content. Regression analysis showed that wives’ other-focus, not husbands’, explained variance in shared selves. A Bayesian actor-partner interdependence model ({APIM}) of both partners’ other-focus and interaction between the 2 revealed a pattern that differed by partner. The association between husband other-focus and his perceived wellness was negative for husbands whose wives were low in other-focus and not significant for husbands with highly other-focused wives. Women’s sense of perceived wellness did not relate to either partner’s other-focus. Results support the notion that shared possible selves may be shared unequally in couples facing chronic illness and suggest the importance of considering both partners’ other-focus to understand perceived wellness. Findings may point to more general processes of relational adaptation to major life stressors such as prostate cancer.

The authors meta-analytically assessed 3 hypotheses: (a) The individual self is motivationally primary, (b) the collective self is motivationally primary, and (c) neither self is inherently primary; instead, motivational primacy depends on which self becomes accessible through contextual features. Results identified the individual self as the primary motivational basis of self definition. People react more strongly to threat and enhancement of the individual than the collective self. Additionally, people more readily deny threatening information and more readily accept enhancing information when it pertains to the individual rather than the collective self, regardless of contextual influences. The individual self is the psychological home base, a stable system that can react flexibly to contextual influences.

704,Life is pretty meaningful,"The human experience of meaning in life is widely viewed as a cornerstone of well-being and a central human motivation. Self-reports of meaning in life relate to a host of important functional outcomes. Psychologists have portrayed meaning in life as simultaneously chronically lacking in human life as well as playing an important role in survival. Examining the growing literature on meaning in life, we address the question 'How meaningful is life, in general?' We review possible answers from various psychological sources, some of which anticipate that meaning in life should be low and others that it should be high. Summaries of epidemiological data and research using two self-report measures of meaning in life suggest that life is pretty meaningful. Diverse samples rate themselves significantly above the midpoint on self-reports of meaning in life. We suggest that if meaning in life plays a role in adaptation, it must be commonplace, as our analysis suggests.

705,Pancultural nostalgia: Prototypical conceptions across cultures,"Nostalgia is a frequently experienced complex emotion, understood by laypersons in the United Kingdom and United States of America to (a) refer prototypically to fond, self-relevant, social memories and (b) be more pleasant (e.g., happy, warm) than unpleasant (e.g., sad, regretful). This research examined whether people across cultures conceive of nostalgia in the same way. Students in 18 countries across 5 continents (N = 1,704) rated the prototypicality of 35 features of nostalgia. The samples showed high levels of agreement on the rank-order of features. In all countries, participants rated previously identified central (vs. peripheral) features as more prototypical of nostalgia, and showed greater interindividual agreement regarding central (vs. peripheral) features. Cluster analyses revealed subtle variation among groups of countries with respect to the strength of these pancultural patterns. All except African countries manifested the same factor structure of nostalgia features. Additional exemplars generated by participants in an open-ended format did not entail elaboration of the existing set of 35 features. Findings identified key points of cross-cultural agreement regarding conceptions of nostalgia, supporting the notion that nostalgia is a pancultural emotion.

707,Meaning in life and intuition,"Three correlational studies and 2 experiments examined the association between meaning in life ({MIL}) and reliance on intuitive information processing. In Studies 1–3 (total N = 5,079), Faith in Intuition ({FI}) scale and {MIL} were correlated positively, controlling for religiosity, positive mood, self-esteem, basic need satisfaction, and need for cognition. Two experiments manipulated processing style. In Study 4 (N = 614), participants were randomly assigned to complete the Cognitive Reflection Task ({CRT}; Fredrick, 2005) either immediately before (reflective/low intuitive mindset condition) or immediately after (control condition) rating {MIL}. Condition did not affect {MIL}. However, low {MIL} rated before the {CRT} predicted superior performance and greater time spent on the task. The association between reflection and {MIL} was curvilinear, such that {MIL} was strongly negatively related to {CRT} performance particularly at low levels of {MIL}. In Study 5 (N = 804), intuitive or reflective mindsets were induced and {FI} and {MIL} were measured. Induced processing style study did not affect {MIL}. However, those high in {MIL} were more responsive to the intuitive mindset induction. The relationship between {FI} and {MIL} was curvilinear (in this and the correlational studies), with intuitive processing being strongly positively related to {MIL} particularly at higher levels of {MIL}. Although often considered in the context of conscious reflection, {MIL} shares a positive relationship with reliance on gut feelings, and high {MIL} may facilitate reliance on those feelings.

709,The impact of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms on women's safer sex negotiation: Influence of ethnicity,"Posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) has been shown to predict later self-reported sexual risk behavior, yet behavioral research is lacking in this area. The present study investigated the impact of {PTSD} severity on negotiation and interpersonal skills effectiveness in simulated high-risk sexual situations among 368 inner-city women. Participants engaged in role-play scenarios involving (1) refusing sexual intercourse without a condom, (2) abstaining from drinking before sex, and (3) refusing sex until both partners were tested for {HIV}. Interviews were audiotaped and rated along dimensions of negotiation effectiveness by raters for whom participant ethnicity was masked. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of {PTSD} and ethnicity on 4 theoretically derived skill sets: (1) assertiveness, (2) using health and preparedness skills, (3) social joining skills, and (4) higher order negotiation skills. Generally, results indicated that {PTSD} severity predicted poorer rated negotiation effectiveness among European Americans, but not African Americans. African Americans' expectations that may prepare them for facing more hardship may help explain ethnic differences.

710,Seeking structure in social organization: Compensatory control and the psychological advantages of hierarchy,"Hierarchies are a ubiquitous form of human social organization. We hypothesized that 1 reason for the prevalence of hierarchies is that they offer structure and therefore satisfy the core motivational needs for order and control relative to less structured forms of social organization. This hypothesis is rooted in compensatory control theory, which posits that (a) individuals have a basic need to perceive the world as orderly and structured, and (b) personal and external sources of control are capable of satisfying this need because both serve the comforting belief that the world operates in an orderly fashion. Our first 2 studies confirmed that hierarchies were perceived as more structured and orderly relative to egalitarian arrangements (Study 1) and that working in a hierarchical workplace promotes a feeling of self-efficacy (Study 2). We threatened participants’ sense of personal control and measured perceptions of and preferences for hierarchy in 5 subsequent experiments. Participants who lacked control perceived more hierarchy occurring in ambiguous social situations (Study 3) and preferred hierarchy more strongly in workplace contexts (Studies 4–5). We also provide evidence that hierarchies are indeed appealing because of their structure: Preference for hierarchy was higher among individuals high in Personal Need for Structure and a control threat increased preference for hierarchy even among participants low in Personal Need for Structure (Study 5). Framing a hierarchy as unstructured reversed the effect of control threat on hierarchy (Study 6). Finally, hierarchy-enhancing jobs were more appealing after control threat, even when they were low in power and status (Study 7).

711,A functional basis for structure-seeking: Exposure to structure promotes willingness to engage in motivated action,"A recurring observation of experimental psychologists is that people prefer, seek out, and even selectively 'see' structure in their social and natural environments. Structure-seeking has been observed across a wide range of phenomena—from the detection of patterns in random arrays to affinities for order-providing political, religious, social, and scientific worldviews—and is exacerbated under psychological threat. Why are people motivated for structure? An intriguing, but untested, explanation holds that perceiving structure, even in domains unrelated to one’s current behavioral context, can facilitate willingness to take goal-directed actions. Supporting this, in 5 studies, reminders of structure in nature or society increase willingness to engage in goal pursuit.

Design: Prospective, longitudinal study of 182 probands undergoing {BRCA}1/2 testing, with assessments 1-, 6-, and 12-months postdisclosure. Measures: Primary predictors were health beliefs and emotional responses to testing assessed 1-month postdisclosure. Main outcomes included women's perception of whether they had made a final risk management decision (decision status) and decisional conflict related to this issue. Results: There were four patterns of decision making, depending on how long it took women to make a final decision and the stability of their decision status across assessments. Late decision makers and nondecision makers reported the highest decisional conflict; however, substantial numbers of women—even early and intermediate decision makers—reported elevated decisional conflict. Analyses predicting decisional conflict 1- and 12-months postdisclosure found that, after accounting for control variables and decision status, health beliefs and emotional factors predicted decisional conflict at different timepoints, with health beliefs more important 1 month after test disclosure and emotional factors more important 1 year later. Conclusion: Many of these women may benefit from decision making assistance.

713,Automatic emotion regulation after social exclusion: Tuning to positivity,"Nine experiments tested competing hypotheses regarding nonconscious affective responses to acute social exclusion and how such responses may relate to positive mental health. The results strongly and consistently indicated that acute social exclusion increased nonconscious positive affect. Compared to nonexcluded participants, excluded participants recalled more positive memories from childhood than did accepted participants (Experiment 1), gave greater weight to positive emotion in their judgments of word similarity (Experiments 2 and 3), and completed more ambiguous word stems with happy words (Experiments 4a and 4b). This process was apparently automatic, as participants asked to imagine exclusion overestimated explicit distress and underestimated implicit positivity (Experiment 3). Four final experiments showed that this automatic emotion regulation process was found among participants low (but not high) in depressive symptoms (Experiments 5 and 6) and among participants high (but not low) in self-esteem (Experiments 7 and 8). These findings suggest that acute exclusion sets in motion an automatic emotion regulation process in which positive emotions become highly accessible, which relates to positive mental health.

714,Bicultural terror management: Identity hybridity moderates the effect of mortality salience on biculturals’ familiarity versus novelty seeking tendency,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) shows that familiarity and novelty seeking are two distinct ways of deriving meaning. In the present research, we applied this analysis to individuals with two cultural backgrounds. Three studies examined whether these two divergent responses to mortality salience ({MS}) correspond with varying degrees of identity hybridity among biculturals. Following {MS}, low hybridity led to more familiarity seeking in the form of a stronger need for structure (Study 1) and less novelty seeking in the form of reduced willingness to explore (Study 2). In contrast, high hybridity tended to lead to the opposite following {MS}, particularly heightened interest in educational programs that facilitate exploration (Study 3). Results further clarified that these effects occurred only if bicultural identity was primed first (Study 1) and that they could not be reduced to broad personality traits (Study 2 and 3). We conclude by discussing the implications of expanding {TMT}'s critical insight into the conflictual side of intergroup contact in the globalized world to the hitherto unexplored side of biculturalism.

Participants (N = 444) were randomly assigned to have achievement or relationship goals implicitly primed. The implicit goal primes were followed by randomly assigned achievement or relationship threats that have reliably caused generalized, reactive approach motivation and ideological defense in past research. The threats caused anxious uncertainty (Study 1), reactive approach motivation (Studies 2 and 3), and reactive ideological conviction (Study 4) only when threat-relevant goals had first been primed, but not when threat-irrelevant goals had first been primed. Reactive ideological conviction (Study 4) was eliminated if participants were given an opportunity to attribute their anxiety to a mundane source.

Both relationships were mediated by surface acting at both levels of analysis.

Results revealed that participants in the mindfulness intervention group experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion and more job satisfaction than participants in the control group. The causal effect of mindfulness self-training on emotional exhaustion was mediated by surface acting. Implications for using mindfulness and mindfulness training interventions in organizational research and practice are discussed in conclusion.

717,Understanding the positive social psychological benefits of sport team identification: The team identification-social psychological health model,"This article presents a theoretical model designed to account for the positive relationship between identification with a local sport team and social psychological health. This model, labeled the Team Identification-Social Psychological Health Model, predicts that team identification facilitates well-being by increasing social connections for the fan. Two forms of social connections are developed through team identification: enduring and temporary. Although the enduring and temporary social connections are expected to result in improved well-being, it is predicted that this relationship will be moderated by threats to social identity and efforts to cope with the threats. The social connections resulting from team identification are expected to impact both state (via increases in temporary social connections) and trait well-being (via enduring connections). Finally, because research indicates that group and team identification are more closely related to social well-being than personal well-being, temporary and enduring social connections are predicted to have their greatest impact on social psychological health.

719,Terror management motivation fuels structure-seeking - Handbook of terror management theory.,"The various studies reviewed converge to expand the empirical, theoretical, and practical scope of terror management theory ({TMT}). Empirically, this chapter observes that mortality salience increases not only investment in specific aspects of one's worldview and self-concept, but also nonspecific efforts to attain simple, consistent, and orderly conceptions of the social and physical world. Moreover, temporary threats to these sources of structure heighten the accessibility of death-related cognition, further suggesting their death-denying function. The chapter reviews how ones existential condition shapes even the most seemingly automatic and unthinking processes. A structured world offers something, anything that can be used, recycled, and even rejected to afford the individual with a more stable foundation for ones own construction of life's meaning. {TMT} highlights the basic motives behind why people do what they do, and shows that even some of the most 'hard-wired' drives and abilities play a crucial role in how one thinks about life, death, and the ultimate value of their own existence. Future research on the interface between {TMT} and motivated structure-seeking will benefit from continuing to probe these individual differences and attempting to understand how epistemic goals are balanced when not all can be met at once.

720,Can creativity beat death? A review and evidence on the existential anxiety buffering functions of creative achievement,"The relationship between creativity and symbolic immortality had been long acknowledged by scholars. In a review of the literature, we found 12 papers that empirically examined the relationship between creativity and mortality awareness using a Terror Management Theory paradigm, overall supporting the notion that creativity plays an important role in the management of existential concerns. Also, a mini meta‐analysis of the impact of death awareness on creativity resulted in a small‐medium weighted mean effect. We examined the existential anxiety buffering functions of creative achievement as assessed by the Creative Achievement Questionnaire in a sample of 108 students. It was found that at high, but not low, levels of creative goals, creative achievement was associated with lower death‐thought accessibility under mortality salience in comparison to controls. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical report of the anxiety buffering functions of creative achievement among people for whom creativity constitutes a central part of their cultural worldview. The current findings support the notion that creative achievement may be an avenue for symbolic immortality, particularly among individuals who value creativity. Implications for understanding death‐related creativity motivations and their impact on individuals and society and for the promotion of creative achievement and creative motivation are discussed.

721,Terror management theory: A practical review of research and application,"The same will be done here. Given the content of the present section, it is important to continue exploring the relation between {MS} and other threat types. Not only should researchers utilize different manipulations within the same study, but it is also important to examine whether similar mechanism(s) emerge among the different primes. For example, there is evidence to suggest that terror management effects are partially mediated by increased {DTA}, which may or may not be elicited through other threats. Adding to this, if we are to believe that heightened fear is the emotion eliciting {MS} findings (i.e., Lambert et al., 2014), then the opposite should be true—that is, increasing a fear reaction should increase the accessibility of mortality-related concerns. Although this might be the case when an airplane suddenly plunges thousands of feet toward the earth, it may not be equally present when someone is giving a speech for the first time. It would be interesting to study the boundary conditions (i.e., for whom, under what conditions, when, and how) for which these effects may emerge. More generally, beyond methodological considerations, future work should continue to explore the various defenses that are elicited in response to heightened mortality awareness. For example, many Eastern religions see life and death as part of the same process, with spiritual enlightenment emerging from acceptance. A similar positivity has been observed among prisoners on death row who are awaiting execution, in patients with terminal illnesses who have made peace with their condition, and in older adults with high levels of executive functioning. This research raises the question as to whether such conditions (or individual differences) actually eliminate the potential for anxiety resulting from the awareness of death, or if this is a temporary solution to contain existential concerns.

722,The effects of system-justifying motives on endorsement of essentialist explanations for gender differences,"People have a fundamental motive to view their social system as just, fair, and good and will engage in a number of strategies to rationalize the status quo (Jost \& Banaji, 1994). We propose that one way in which individuals may 'justify the system' is through endorsement of essentialist explanations, which attribute group differences to deep, essential causes. We suggest that system-justifying motives lead to greater endorsement of essentialist explanations because those explanations portray group differences as immutable. Study 1 employed an established system threat manipulation. We found that activating system-justifying motives increases both male and female participants’ endorsement of essentialist explanations for gender differences and that this effect is mediated by beliefs in immutability. In Study 2, we used a goal contagion manipulation and found that both male and female participants primed with a system-justifying goal are significantly more likely to agree with essentialist explanations for gender differences. Study 3 demonstrated that providing an opportunity to explicitly reject a system threat (an alternative means of satisfying the goal to defend the system) attenuates system threat effects on endorsement of essentialist explanations, further suggesting that this process is motivated. Finally, Studies 4a and 4b dissociated the type of cause (biological vs. social) from whether group differences are portrayed as mutable versus immutable and found that system threat increases endorsement of immutable explanations, independent of the type of cause.

723,"Examining the roles of mortality salience, partner gender, self esteem and peer risky sexual behavior in risky sexual behavior among men","Two studies tested whether reminders of safe sex and risky sex would lead to higher mortality salience, and if that higher mortality salience would lead men who have sex with men to be more sexually risky than men who have sex with women. In Study 1, both partner gender groups reported higher mortality salience after the risky sex and death primes, but not after the safe sex or the control primes. In Study 2, the men in both groups only reported higher mortality salience after the death primes. Partner gender moderated the effect of mortality salience primes on men's willingness to engage in risky sexual behavior. Men who have sex with women reported greater willingness to engage in risky sexual behaviors than men who have sex with men after the death prime, and less willingness after the safe sex prime, compared to both the risky sex and control prime. Men who have sex with men did not report any differences in their willingness to engage in risky sexual behavior after any of the priming conditions. Estimates of peer engagement in risky sexual behavior correlated with both groups willingness to engage in risky sexual behavior, whereas self-esteem did not significantly correlate, moderate or mediate willingness to engage in risky sexual behavior in either group. Combining data from Study 1 and Study 2 found both groups reported higher mortality salience after the risky sex and death primes, but not after the safe sex or control primes. Implications for partner gender differences in responses to mortality salience as well as how to design safe-sex interventions are discussed.

In the original article, the number of Asian American subjects in Study 2 was reported incorrectly; the correct number is 24 (12 men, 12 women). For both Study 1 and Study 2, the values reported as standard deviations are standard errors of the estimated marginal means.] Two experiments compared the effects of death thoughts, or mortality salience, on European and Asian Americans. Research on terror management theory has demonstrated that in Western cultural groups, individuals typically employ self-protective strategies in the face of death-related thoughts. Given fundamental East-West differences in self-construal (i.e., the independent vs. interdependent self), we predicted that members of Eastern cultural groups would affirm other people, rather than defend and affirm the self, after encountering conditions of mortality salience. We primed European Americans and Asian Americans with either a death or a control prime and examined the effect of this manipulation on attitudes about a person who violates cultural norms (Study 1) and on attributions about the plight of an innocent victim (Study 2). Mortality salience promoted culturally divergent responses, leading European Americans to defend the self and Asian Americans to defend other people.

725,Two ways to be complex and why they matter: Implications for attitude strength and lying,"Integrative complexity broadly measures the structural complexity of statements. This breadth, although beneficial in multiple ways, can potentially hamper the development of specific theories. In response, the authors developed a model of complex thinking, focusing on 2 different ways that people can be complex within the integrative complexity system and subsequently developed measurements of each of these 2 routes: Dialectical complexity focuses on a dialectical tension between 2 or more competing perspectives, whereas elaborative complexity focuses on complexly elaborating on 1 singular perspective. The authors posit that many variables have different effects on these 2 forms of complexity and subsequently test this idea in 2 different theoretical domains. In Studies 1a, 1b, and 2, the authors demonstrate that variables related to attitude strength (e.g., domain importance, extremism, domain accessibility) decrease dialectical complexity but increase elaborative complexity. In Study 3, the authors show that counterattitudinal lying decreases dialectical complexity but increases elaborative complexity, implicating a strategic (as opposed to a cognitive strain) view of the lying-complexity relationship. The authors argue that this dual demonstration across 2 different theoretical domains helps establish the utility of the new model and measurements as well as offer the potential to reconcile apparent conflicts in the area of cognitive complexity.

It is argued that Sedikides et al. did not replicate past research because they did not measure self-enhancement in their studies. The present article provides a theoretical basis for understanding cross-cultural differences in self-enhancement and considers the question of universality by exploring 2 different conceptualizations of positive self-regard.

727,Talking to the enemy: Difficult conversations and ethnopolitical conflict,"The article reviews intractability qualities and uses the Israeli‐Palestinian conflict as an example of the difficult conversations that characterize the conflict between competing groups. There are two typical research trends for analyzing group conflict. These are either a rational model or intractable conflict model. The rational model assumes that differences are over realistic issues such as scarce resources. The intractable model focuses on identity and emotions. Intractable conflicts are recalcitrant, nonrational, and particularly resistant to resolution. They generate difficult conversations. The argument here demonstrates how intractability establishes the descriptive conditions for difficult conversations about conflicts. These conditions are incommensurate cultural narratives, narrative particularity, existential threat, power differences, and delegitimization. Islam and the West and the Israelis and Palestinians are used as examples. Finally, such difficult divides must attend to five issues that ameliorate difficult conversations, namely, inclusion, maximization of arguments and reasons, controlling undue influences, dialogic equality, and the value of deliberation.

728,The role of close relationships in terror management: A systematic review and research agenda,"Terror management theory outlines how humans seek self-esteem and worldview validation to manage death-related anxiety. Accumulating evidence reveals that close relationships serve a similar role. However, to date, there has been no synthesis of the literature that delineates when close relationships buffer mortality concerns, under what conditions, on which specific outcomes, and for whom. This systematic review presents over two decades of research to address these questions. Findings from 73 reviewed studies revealed that close relationships serve an important role in buffering death-related anxiety. A range of dispositional and situational moderating factors influence either the activation or inhibition of relational strivings to manage heightened death awareness, the most influential being attachment, gender, and relationship-contingent self-esteem. These findings were integrated into an overarching model that highlights some of the conditions under which mortality salience ({MS}) influences relational outcomes. We conclude by highlighting a range of theoretical and methodological concerns to be addressed by future research.

In Study 1, experientiality and induced positive mood interacted to predict the emergence of belief in videos purporting to show unidentified flying objects or ghosts. In Study 2, naturally occurring {PA} interacted with experientiality to predict susceptibility to sympathetic magic, specifically difficulty in throwing darts at a picture of a baby (demonstrating the law of similarity). In Study 3, induced mood interacted with experientiality to predict sitting farther away from, and expressing less liking for, a partner who had stepped in excrement (demonstrating the law of contagion). Results are interpreted as indicating that {PA} promotes experiential processing. Implications for the psychology of nonrational beliefs and behaviors are discussed.

730,Cultural pluralism and prejudice reduction,"Predictions derived from models of cultural pluralism and cultural assimilation were tested. Previous research has shown that highlighting differences between ethnic groups, in conjunction with self-focus, can reduce prejudice. The presented research tested the following questions: (a) does highlighting differences function to reduce prejudice between groups that are dissimilar to each other as well as between those that are highly similar, (b) is prejudice reduction due to distinctiveness a function of the lessened ingroup positivity or lessened outgroup negativity, (c) does making distinctiveness salient reduce prejudice toward only the distinctive outgroups or to outgroups more generically, and (d) does the manipulation equally impact African American, Mexican American, Mexican National, and White American participants? Results demonstrated that highlighting differences while simultaneously focusing on the self reduces prejudice, although similarity mediates the relationship with those who are perceived as more different. Distinctiveness also reduced outgroup negativity and generalized to other outgroups. Finally, the manipulation reduced prejudice only for White Americans, Mexican Americans, and Mexican Nationals.

731,When dreaming is believing: The (motivated) interpretation of dreams,"This research investigated laypeople's interpretation of their dreams. Participants from both Eastern and Western cultures believed that dreams contain hidden truths (Study 1) and considered dreams to provide more meaningful information about the world than similar waking thoughts (Studies 2 and 3). The meaningfulness attributed to specific dreams, however, was moderated by the extent to which the content of those dreams accorded with participants' preexisting beliefs--from the theories they endorsed to attitudes toward acquaintances, relationships with friends, and faith in God (Studies 3-6). Finally, dream content influenced judgment: Participants reported greater affection for a friend after considering a dream in which a friend protected rather than betrayed them (Study 5) and were equally reluctant to fly after dreaming or learning of a plane crash (Studies 2 and 3). Together, these results suggest that people engage in motivated interpretation of their dreams and that these interpretations impact their everyday lives.

732,Americans respond politically to 9/11: Understanding the impact of the terrorist attacks and their aftermath,"The 9/11 terrorist attacks have had profound effect on U.S. domestic and foreign security policy, leading to several expensive wars and the erosion of civil liberties (under the {USA} {PATRIOT} Act). We review evidence on political reactions to the 9/11 attacks and conclude that subjective reactions to terrorism played an important role in shaping support for national security policy in the wake of 9/11. Support for a strong national security policy was most pronounced among Americans who perceived the nation as at threat from terrorism and felt angry at terrorists. In contrast, Americans who were personally affected by the attacks were more likely to feel anxious about terrorism, and this anxiety translated into less support for overseas military action. In addition, Americans who felt insecure after the 9/11 attacks and perceived a high future threat of terrorism were more likely than others to support strong foreign and domestic national security policies. Overall, research on American political reactions to 9/11 suggests that support for a strong government response to terrorism is most likely when members of a population perceive a high risk of future terrorism and feel angry at terrorists.

733,Aging and coping with mortality: Understanding attitudes about aging and age-related differences in coping with death - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Even people fortunate enough to enjoy a physically and psychologically healthy aging process may encounter reminders of their age that make them wonder where the time has gone. The aging process itself may serve as a continual mortality prime, thereby impacting how young adults perceive older adults, how older adults perceive themselves, and the ways in which older adults cope with the problem of mortality. This chapter approaches existential issues related to aging from two primary perspectives: the consideration of young and older adults' attitudes about aging and older individuals and the examination of age-related differences in death anxiety and responses to reminders of mortality Using terror management theory's ({TMT}) and relevant theories from the psychology of aging literature, the chapter considers the existential challenges that aging presents and explore potential clinical applications, which may promote healthy adaptation to aging and older age via awareness and acknowledgment of life's brevity. Though there are multiple hypotheses associated with {TMT}, the most frequently investigated is the mortality salience hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that to the extent the cultural worldview and self-esteem provides protection from death-related anxiety, reminders of mortality will intensify the need for protection and validation of that anxiety-buffering system.

Results suggested that the 11 types of goals the authors assessed were consistently organized in a circumplex fashion across the 15 cultures. The circumplex was well described by positing 2 primary dimensions underlying the goals: intrinsic (e.g., self-acceptance, affiliation) versus extrinsic (e.g., financial success, image) and self-transcendent (e.g., spirituality) versus physical (e.g., hedonism). The circumplex model of goal contents was also quite similar in both wealthier and poorer nations, although there were some slight cross-cultural variations. The relevance of these results for several theories of motivation and personality are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Grouzet, Frederick M.

736,The method behind the science: A guide to conducting terror management theory research - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Terror management research, and the number of experimenters who conduct these studies, has grown significantly over the past 30 years. Not only has the theory been studied across a variety of different disciplines, but it has also been tested in over 30 different countries around the world. This chapter provides social scientists, both novice and experienced, a quick overview of the materials and methods utilized in terror management theory ({TMT}) studies. It begins by providing information (and tabled references) about the manipulations commonly used by terror management researchers to elicit thoughts of death [i.e., mortality salience ({MS})], along with a discussion on the selection of different control conditions. Following this, it provides a description of the various measures utilized to assess worldview defense ({WVD}), self-esteem striving, relationship needs, and the accessibility of death-related thoughts. Finally, the chapter presents some of the methodological nuances that are important in successfully eliciting {TMT} effects, along with a review of different moderating variables, including individual difference characteristics. Although there might come a time where {TMT} is superseded by a different perspective, the theory at present continues to make important strides in understanding the motivation behind human attitudes and behavior.

The impacts represent both direct (i.e. heat stress) and indirect (i.e. economic loss, threats to health and well-being, displacement and forced migration, collective violence and civil conflict, and alienation from a degraded environment) consequences of global climate change.

738,Death and the therapist: Investigating the effects of mortality salience on therapists' reactions to transgender clients,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) predicts that reminders of death, or mortality salience ({MS}), increases ingroup identification and leads to more negative evaluations of individuals whose behaviors or appearance do not align with the values of the dominant culture. Moreover, {MS} may increase stereotypic cognition, leading to negative evaluations of marginalized individuals whose appearance or behavior do not fit common stereotypes. Accordingly, this study sought to test whether {MS} affects the responses of clinically active psychotherapists to transgender clients whose appearance did not align with their identified gender. Participants (N = 571) were asked to complete an online survey. The survey presented one group of psychotherapists with a death-related questionnaire, and a comparison group with a questionnaire concerning dental pain. Participants then responded to a written fictional clinical vignette accompanied by one of two portraits of a male-identified transgender individual. One portrait exhibited a traditionally feminine appearance (identified-gender-incongruent), and the other exhibited a traditionally masculine appearance (identified-gender-congruent). This investigator hypothesized that psychotherapists high in need for closure would respond most negatively to the client in the mortality-salient/identified-gender-incongruent condition. Results of the primary analysis were inconclusive. However, exploratory analyses suggested possible directions for future research into therapist attitudes towards transgender clients. Finally, this investigator considers implications for clinical practice and training. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2018 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Cohn, Aaron S.",1,,738
739,Reducing the stigma associated with seeking psychotherapy through self-affirmation,"Psychotherapy may be underutilized because people experience self-stigma—the internalization of public stigma associated with seeking psychotherapy. The purpose of this study was to experimentally test whether the self-stigma associated with seeking psychotherapy could be reduced by a self-affirmation intervention wherein participants reflected on an important personal characteristic. Compared with a control group, we hypothesized that a self-affirmation writing task would attenuate self-stigma, and thereby evidence indirect effects on intentions and willingness to seek psychotherapy. Participants were 84 undergraduates experiencing psychological distress. After completing pretest measures of self-stigma, intentions, and willingness to seek psychotherapy, participants were randomly assigned to either a self-affirmation or a control writing task, and subsequently completed posttest measures of self-stigma, intentions, and willingness to seek psychotherapy. Consistent with hypotheses, participants who engaged in self-affirmation reported lower self-stigma at posttest. Moreover, the self-affirmation writing task resulted in a positive indirect effect on willingness to seek psychotherapy, though results failed to support an indirect effect on intentions to seek psychotherapy. Findings suggest that self-affirmation theory may provide a useful framework for designing interventions that seek to address the underutilization of psychological services through reductions in self-stigma.

740,"Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust","What is the function of disgust? Whereas traditional models have suggested that disgust serves to protect the self or neutralize reminders of our animal nature, an evolutionary perspective suggests that disgust functions to solve 3 qualitatively different adaptive problems related to pathogen avoidance, mate choice, and social interaction. The authors investigated this 3-domain model of disgust across 4 studies and examined how sensitivity to these functional domains relates to individual differences in other psychological constructs. Consistent with their predictions, factor analyses demonstrated that disgust sensitivity partitions into domains related to pathogens, sexuality, and morality. Further, sensitivity to the 3 domains showed predictable differentiation based on sex, perceived vulnerability to disease, psychopathic tendencies, and Big 5 personality traits. In exploring these 3 domains of disgust, the authors introduce a new measure of disgust sensitivity. Appreciation of the functional heterogeneity of disgust has important implications for research on individual differences in disgust sensitivity, emotion, clinical impairments, and neuroscience.

741,When one cause casts doubt on another: A normative analysis of discounting in causal attribution,"The question of whether lay attributors are biased in their discounting of 1 cause given an alternative cause has not been resolved by decades of research, largely due to the lack of a clear standard for the rational amount of discounting. The authors propose a normative model in which the attributor's causal schemas and discounting inferences are represented in terms of subjective probability. The analysis examines Kelley's (1972b) proposed causal schemas and then other schemas for multiple causes (varying in assumptions about prior probability, sufficiency, correlation, and number of causes) to determine when discounting is rational. It reveals that discounting is implied from most, but not all, possible causal schemas, albeit at varying amounts. Hence, certain patterns of discounting previously interpreted as biases may, in fact, reflect coherent inferences from causal schemas. Results of 2 studies, which measured causal assumptions and inferences, support this interpretation ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Morris, Michael W. and Larrick, Richard P.",0,,741
742,The terror management underpinnings of risky behavior - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Most individuals have the ability to perceive risks accurately, yet they do not necessarily weigh these risks when deciding whether or not to engage in risky behavior. This familiar fact of life is probably what has sent many scholars on a search for an explanation of why some people tend to endorse risky behavior on a daily basis. Behaviors such as substance abuse, heavy alcohol consumption, unprotected sexual intercourse, reckless driving, or extreme sports are the most common examples of potential threats to one's health, or even life, that are engaged in regularly. Such behaviors can lead not only to substantial losses to self and significant others, but also to unintentional harm to innocent bystanders. This chapter consistently sees that exposure to death reminders elevates the level of risk individuals are willing to endorse, and the special role played by their risk-related self-esteem. It is important to note that these effects are not conscious; all the studies mentioned here demonstrate distal effects of mortality salience that occur when thoughts of death are accessible but outside conscious awareness. The chapter discusses the moderating role of personality characteristics and gender differences.

744,Accountability as a deterrent to self-enhancement: The search for mechanisms,"Although self-enhancement is linked to psychological benefits, it is also associated with personal and interpersonal liabilities (e.g., excessive risk taking, social exclusion). Hence, structuring social situations that prompt people to keep their self-enhancing beliefs in check can confer personal and interpersonal advantages. The authors examined whether accountability can serve this purpose. Accountability was defined as the expectation to explain, justify, and defend one's self-evaluations (grades on an essay) to another person ('audience'). Experiment 1 showed that accountability curtails self-enhancement. Experiment 2 ruled out audience concreteness and status as explanations for this effect. Experiment 3 demonstrated that accountability-induced self-enhancement reduction is due to identifiability. Experiment 4 documented that identifiability decreases self-enhancement because of evaluation expectancy and an accompanying focus on one's weaknesses.

The effect of self-esteem on {PA} was lower with increasing physical symptoms. For negative affect ({NA}), the Self-Esteem × Physical Symptoms × Age interaction was significant. In older adults, the effect of self-esteem on {NA} was lower with increasing physical symptoms. Thus, the effect of self-esteem ran opposite to the expected buffering effect. In addition, the age difference in the effect of self-esteem on {NA} presents potential challenges to the adaptive capacity of older adults in emotional well-being.

747,Terror management theory and religious belief - Handbook of terror management theory.,"The human motivation to manage the awareness of mortality helps provide a more complete understanding of why religious belief has been such a stable and wide-reaching force in human culture. Terror management processes fuel the dualistic belief that the self is an immortal soul, separate from the mortal body, and motivates religious faith in the spiritual purity of sacred religious figures and in the power of souls to conquer the limits of the natural world. Similarly, the awareness of death fuels faith in supernatural immortality (e.g., afterlife), supporting myths about supernatural agency (gods, spirits, creation), and social behaviors designed to bolster and protect the perceived legitimacy of such religious beliefs. Thus, although there is of course variation in particular religious orientation, the motivation to manage the awareness of death drives the vast and colorful landscapes of religious pursuit of supernatural immortality. This chapter discusses terror management theory and religious belief. Following this, it provides brief description on time management theory research and religious faith and the social maintenance of religious faith. The chapter provides the variation in religious orientations and how the human body shapes religious terror management.

748,Why giving up the keys can be terrifying: Examining driving retirement through a terror management theory paradigm,"Driving retirement, or giving up the keys, is a current topic of interest in the gerontological literature. Most adults will outlive their ability to drive safely, yet do not plan for driving retirement, although planning for driving retirement appears to result in better outcomes. The current study examined the possibility that older adults avoid driving retirement because it is a mortality prime (reminder of death), as well as the possible role of implicit self-esteem in buffering against mortality concerns specifically in an older adult population. Participants in the current study ( n = 90) were randomly assigned into one of three experimental conditions, and completed measures assessing demographic information and self-report of cognition. They then completed a word puzzle that delivered a mortality prime, driving retirement prime, or control (pain) prime, depending on their experimental condition. Subsequently, participants completed personality and mood assessments as filler measures. They then completed measures of generative concern and implicit self-esteem. It was predicted that participants in the mortality prime conditions and the driving retirement prime conditions would respond equivalently on the generative concern measure and those in the driving retirement prime condition would report significantly higher generative concern than those in the control condition. Further, it was posited that those with higher implicit self-esteem would report less generative concern than those with lower implicit self-esteem. Results did not support that driving retirement is a mortality prime; no significant differences were detected between experimental groups. Results also suggested that implicit self-esteem and generative concern are significantly negatively correlated. Implicit self-esteem was a significant predictor of generative concern; however, this relationship became nonsignificant when other covariates were entered into the regression. These results suggest that implicit self-esteem in older adults may buffer against response to mortality salience (measured by generative concern). This may have implications for future terror management theory research with older adult populations, as well as further research in driving retirement. Further study may use a larger sample to ascertain the possibility of driving retirement as a mortality prime.

That article showed evidence suggesting that priming the salience of uncertainty was just as powerful, if not more powerful,than priming thoughts of one’s own death in one’s subsequent endorsement of social norms and values. Moreover, when participants who wrote about uncertainty in their death stories were removed from the terror management condition, the terror management effect on norms and values was no longer significant. This seemed to be compelling evidence that terror management was not really about fear of death so much a sit was about uncertainty. It turns out that this may not always be true.

752,The Costly Pursuit of Self-Esteem,"Researchers have recently questioned the benefits associated with having high self-esteem. The authors propose that the importance of self-esteem lies more in how people strive for it rather than whether it is high or low. They argue that in domains in which their self-worth is invested, people adopt the goal to validate their abilities and qualities, and hence their self-worth. When people have self-validation goals, they react to threats in these domains in ways that undermine learning; relatedness; autonomy and self-regulation; and over time, mental and physical health. The short-term emotional benefits of pursuing self-esteem are often outweighed by long-term costs. Previous research on self-esteem is reinterpreted in terms of self-esteem striving. Cultural roots of the pursuit of self-esteem are considered. Finally, the alternatives to pursuing self-esteem, and ways of avoiding its costs, are discussed.

In Study 2, nostalgia increased intentions to pursue goals of connecting with friends. In Study 3, experimentally induced pessimism about achieving relationship goals instigated nostalgia. In Study 4, we found evidence that it is the interpersonal nature of nostalgia that is associated with striving to connect with others. Specifically, nostalgia about aspects of the past that were high in sociality was associated with intentions to interact with others, whereas nostalgia for aspects of the past that were low in sociality was not. In Study 5, nostalgic reflection increased friendship-approach goal striving relative to reflecting on ordinary social memories, but did not increase friendship-avoidant goal striving. Finally, in Studies 6 and 7, we found evidence that social-efficacy mediated the effect of nostalgia on striving to connect with others and striving to overcome interpersonal challenges. Together, these findings establish nostalgia as catalyst for social goal pursuit and growth.

754,A consideration of three critical hypotheses - Handbook of terror management theory.,"This chapter reviews a portion of the large body of work supporting terror management theory's ({TMT}'s) three primary hypotheses: the mortality salience ({MS}) hypothesis, the death-thought accessibility ({DTA}) hypothesis, and the anxiety-buffer hypothesis. Experiments testing the {MS} hypothesis have confirmed that reminders of death intensify people's need to uphold faith in their cultural worldview and pursue self-esteem. It reviews the various studies supporting each of the three hypotheses, with an eye toward some of the particularly novel, counterintuitive findings that have been revealed. Following this, the chapter uses {TMT}'s three key hypotheses to generate a series of testable predictions about the role of immortality in people's defense of the cultural worldview and pursuit of self-esteem. To date, only a handful of studies have directly examined immortality as a terror management motive, which is somewhat surprising given that a desire for death-transcendence is a core component of the theory. The chapter begins with a brief overview of {TMT}. Finally, to further demonstrate the generative power of {TMT}, the chapter derives a series of testable predictions concerning the role of immortality in people's defense of the cultural worldview and self-esteem.

The current research examined whether naturally occurring instances of death (i.e., Ebola) correspond to results found in laboratory studies. The results of two experiments demonstrated that participants experienced a greater accessibility of death-related thoughts in response to an Ebola prime during a regional outbreak. Study 2 also showed that increased mortality awareness following an Ebola manipulation was associated with greater worldview defense (i.e., religious fundamentalism). Together, these results suggest that reminders of death in the form of a disease threat operate similarly to a mortality salience manipulation.

757,The roles of negative affect and goal adjustment capacities in breast cancer survivors: Associations with physical activity and diurnal cortisol secretion,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 38(8) of Health Psychology (see record [rid]2019-44318-001[/rid]). In the article, there was an error in the calculation of the cortisol values. Please see erratum for complete description. The previously reported main effect of negative affect on cortisol was no longer significant (please see corrected Table 2 in the erratum). In addition, two of the included covariates exerted additional effects on cortisol {AUC} in the reanalysis of the data. The association between negative affect and cortisol became significantly stronger for participants who were younger, as compared to those who were older, and for participants with a lower, as compared to a higher, level of education. In no case did the corrected {AUC} values make a substantive change to the results of the supplemental analyses findings, except for the interaction effect of goal reengagement in the association between negative affect and {AUC}, which was not significant if fatigue was included in the original model.] Objective: This study examined whether within-person changes of breast cancer survivors’ high-arousal negative affect (e.g., feeling scared, upset, anxious, or guilty) could predict high levels of diurnal cortisol secretion and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ({MVPA}). In addition, goal adjustment capacities (goal disengagement and goal reengagement) were expected to buffer the effect of negative affect on cortisol and to increase its effect on {MVPA}. Method: High-arousal negative affect, self-reported {MVPA}, area-under-the-curve of diurnal cortisol secretion, and goal adjustment capacities were assessed in a longitudinal sample of 145 female breast cancer survivors. Results: Based on hierarchical linear modeling, breast cancer survivors reported increased levels of both {MVPA} and cortisol secretion if they experienced higher (as compared with lower) levels of high-arousal negative affect than their personal average. Furthermore, within-person negative affect was associated with: (a) higher {MVPA} among participants with high (but not low) goal reengagement capacities; and (b) elevated cortisol secretion among participants with low (but not high) goal reengagement capacities. Conclusions: High-arousal negative affect may exert differing functions among breast cancer survivors in that it can trigger adaptive health behaviors, yet simultaneously elevate diurnal cortisol secretion. In addition, being able to engage in new goals may be a necessary condition for breast cancer survivors to experience the beneficial behavioral effects of high-arousal negative affect, and it may prevent the adverse effect of negative affect on enhanced cortisol output.

758,Can't take my eyes off you: Attentional adhesion to mates and rivals,"In 3 experiments, mating primes interacted with functionally relevant individual differences to guide basic, lower order social perception. A visual cuing method assessed biases in attentional adhesion--a tendency to have one's attention captured by particular social stimuli. Mate-search primes increased attentional adhesion to physically attractive members of the opposite sex (potential mates) among participants with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation but not among sexually restricted participants (Studies 1 and 2). A mate-guarding prime increased attentional adhesion to physically attractive members of one's own sex (potential rivals) among participants who were concerned with threats posed by intrasexual competitors but not among those less concerned about such threats (Study 3). Findings are consistent with a functionalist approach to motivation and social cognition and highlight the utility of integrating evolutionary and social cognitive perspectives.

Despite the increasing popularity of racing (driving) games, nothing is known about the psychological impact of this genre. This study investigated whether playing racing games affects cognitions, affect, and behaviors that can promote risk taking in actual road traffic situations. In Study 1, the authors found that the frequency of playing racing games was positively associated with competitive driving, obtrusive driving, and car accidents; a negative association with cautious driving was observed. To determine cause and effect, in Study 2, the authors manipulated whether participants played 1 of 3 racing games or 1 of 3 neutral games. Participants who played a racing game subsequently reported a higher accessibility of cognitions and affect positively associated with risk taking than did participants who played a neutral game. Finally, on a more behavioral level, in Study 3, the authors found that men who played a racing game subsequently took higher risks in computer-simulated critical road traffic situations than did men who played a neutral game.

Emotions can be differentiated on a number of underlying dimensions, including uncertainty, and uncertainty can influence information processing. On these grounds, we proposed and tested the idea that (1) emotions that associate with appraisals of uncertainty (fear, sadness) lead to more structured ideation than emotions that associate with appraisals of certainty (happiness, anger) and that (2) appraisals of uncertainty drive this effect. Findings of four experiments on idea generation in which (un)certainty was primed (Study 1) and emotions were induced through self-generated imagery (Study 2–4) supported these predictions.

761,Death and debt: The effects of mortality salience on willingness to incur education debt,"In the last twenty-five years, Terror Management Theory researchers have generated a large body of empirical support for the proposition that some of humans' most basic attitudes and behaviors are influenced, outside of those individuals' awareness, by death anxiety. Studies have shown that death anxiety may shape individuals' social attitudes, political and religious affiliations, attitudes toward risk, consumer attitudes and behaviors, and much more. Terror Management Theorists argue that death anxiety influences these domains because of individuals' defenses against mortality anxiety. They posit that mortality anxiety, were it to be fully experienced, would be paralyzing; thus, they argue that in order to avoid the paralysis of terror, individuals daily defend against the anxiety of death in two unconscious ways: first, they take measures (cognitive, affective, behavioral) to bolster their self-esteem and second, they justify their own cultural worldviews. {TMT} theorists propose that world-view justification confirms an individual's connection to the larger culture that will outlive her and that self-esteem bolstering confirms an individual's sense of self-worth in the context of that culture. In this way, self-esteem bolstering and world-view justification buffer death anxiety. Terror Management theorists have developed an experimental paradigm to test their theories. {TMT} experiments make thoughts of death salient to a group of participants and then compare those individuals to a control group on a variable of interest. {TMT} experiments designed in this way have found that mortality-salient individuals endorse and do markedly different things than controls—for instance, they will judge a member of an outgroup more harshly, or become more polarized in their religious and political views, or vie to consume more resources, express intentions to take more risks, and much more. Terror Management theorists have looked at the influence of mortality anxiety on a very wide range of topics, many of them very timely and topical. Several researchers have generated fascinating findings on subjects related to behavioral economics—for instance, that when under the sway of mortality salience, people consume more resources, evidence greater `greed,' show greater endorsement of materialistic values, and take more risks in self-esteem-relevant domains. Despite this research in areas closely related to behavioral economics, there has as yet been little sustained {TMT} research interest in the influence of mortality anxiety on individual financial choices. The present study aimed to make a start at filling that research gap by looking at the influence of mortality anxiety on personal financial decision-making. Specifically, it examined one particular incarnation of individual financial choice: willingness to incur personal higher education debt. The present experiment followed the well-validated Terror Management Theory experimental paradigm. In an online study conducted with 271 participants, 102 of whom completed the study, the investigator primed thoughts of death for approximately half of the participants and then administered an anxiety-provoking but non-mortality-related prime to the other half of participants. All participants were then measured on their willingness to incur education debt. Though findings revealed that the mortality anxiety priming procedure was not effective in an online administration environment, results still indicated that general state anxiety may increase willingness to incur education debt. The investigator was aware that other factors, besides or in addition to mortality anxiety, might play roles in willingness to incur education debt. For instance, previous indebtedness and previous education level might influence subsequent willingness to incur education debt due to individuals' avoidance of cognitive dissonance.

Moreover, Palestinians expressed tolerance of violence when the perpetrator was a Palestinian who was perceived to be motivated by external motivations. However, Palestinians also expressed greater support of peace. The discussion examines the role of attributions in ethnic conflict.

765,"Human dignity, self-worth, and humiliation: A comparative legal–psychological approach","The concept of human dignity is a central concept in many legal systems. Yet the increasing and sometimes excessive use of this concept has generated a number of serious problems which have only recently become clear in empirical research and court rulings showing that the meanings of dignity have become contradictory and can no longer advance human rights protections. This paper offers a way out of the deadlock. We offer an approach which is anchored in the psychology of the self, specifically in the human need for maintaining positive self-worth. We elaborate on what this conceptualization means in terms of violations of dignity, emphasizing dignity's antonym, humiliation, as well as other closely related aspects of social exclusion, lowering of social status, and denials of recognition more generally. We then demonstrate that this approach has in fact been applied in a range of important legal cases, often establishing constitutional precedents. We illustrate this through a comparative review and analysis of judgments from the United States Supreme Court, the European Court of Human Rights, and the Supreme Court of Israel. We argue that this psychological approach to human dignity can bring logic and consistency back into its meaning and usages.

766,The effects of mortality salience on interest in death (and life) among high openness individuals,"Terror management theory suggests that the fear of death is ubiquitous. Only recently has death been examined as something potentially interesting from this framework, and specifically, to individuals high in trait openness (Boyd, Morris, \& Goldenberg, 2017). This research, however, did not clearly delineate if participants were actually becoming interested in death. My studies address this ambiguity by examining what high openness individuals are becoming interested in and if the way death is construed impacts interest. Study 1 tested if in addition to becoming more generally interested, high openness individuals become interested in death per se following mortality salience (relative to a control), as Boyd et al. (2017) speculated. Analyses revealed that individuals high in experiential openness only became more interested in death if the death interest measure came after a scale of general interest (i.e., after a longer delay). In contrast to predictions, individuals high in general openness did not exhibit these effects. In Study 2, I hypothesized that high openness individuals would become more interested in art and philosophy following mortality salience (relative to a control) because of the relevance of these domains to openness. This hypothesis was not supported. In Study 3, I tested if highlighting death's experiential or intellectual qualities would increase general interest and subsequently decrease death anxiety, depending on if one's unique brand of openness valued such qualities. Only when death was construed of in an experiential manner (relative to a control) did individuals high in experiential openness become more generally interested, and unexpectedly, more anxious about death. Together these studies demonstrate that the aspect of openness related to valuing experience can actually increase one's interest in death, and when death is construed in a way that corresponds with this type of openness, general interest also increases.

767,"Mortality salience effects on gender stereotype attitudes and sexism, and the moderating effect of gender role conflicts","Research on existential mortality fears has indicated that death reminders impact individuals at the cognitive and behavioral levels. One way people cope with this threat is through cherishing cultural values that provide life with meaning. However, little research has explored how death reminders impact cultural standards regarding gender. These cultural values often manifest through various means by male and female groups. Guided by terror management theory, which posits that people address threats to their existence by engaging in culturally-sanctioned behaviors to enhance their self-esteem, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mortality salience ({MS}) on male participants' propensity for sexism and attitudes towards those with atypical gender stereotypes. Participants (n = 136) were recruited from courses at a local university and were selected based on the assumption that they had been exposed to media depicting death-related events. A quantitative research design was used to examine differences between the experimental {MS} and control pain salience conditions, and to assess effect sizes. Results from a {MANOVA} indicated that {MS} was associated with significantly higher sexism scores (F = 15.322, p {\textless} .001) as measured by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and with less favorable ratings of peers (as measured by a common opinion rating scale used in previous research in this area) who violated traditional gender stereotypes ( F = 13.459, p {\textless} .001). The findings imply existential threats may contribute to negative stereotyping based on gender and enhance conservative views of gender stereotypes. Implications for social change are discussed involving the reduction of intolerance and prejudice directed at those who hold opposing worldviews.

768,Does low self-esteem predict depression and anxiety? A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies,"Low self-esteem and depression are strongly related, but there is not yet consistent evidence on the nature of the relation. Whereas the vulnerability model states that low self-esteem contributes to depression, the scar model states that depression erodes self-esteem. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the models are specific for depression or whether they are also valid for anxiety. We evaluated the vulnerability and scar models of low self-esteem and depression, and low self-esteem and anxiety, by meta-analyzing the available longitudinal data (covering 77 studies on depression and 18 studies on anxiety). The mean age of the samples ranged from childhood to old age. In the analyses, we used a random-effects model and examined prospective effects between the variables, controlling for prior levels of the predicted variables. For depression, the findings supported the vulnerability model: The effect of self-esteem on depression (β = −.16) was significantly stronger than the effect of depression on self-esteem (β = −.08). In contrast, the effects between low self-esteem and anxiety were relatively balanced: Self-esteem predicted anxiety with β = −.10, and anxiety predicted self-esteem with β = −.08. Moderator analyses were conducted for the effect of low self-esteem on depression; these suggested that the effect is not significantly influenced by gender, age, measures of self-esteem and depression, or time lag between assessments. If future research supports the hypothesized causality of the vulnerability effect of low self-esteem on depression, interventions aimed at increasing self-esteem might be useful in reducing the risk of depression.

769,Threat and selective exposure: The moderating role of threat and decision context on confirmatory information search after decisions,"Previous studies on the impact of perceived threat on confirmatory information search (selective exposure) in the context of decision making have yielded mixed results. Some studies have suggested that confirmatory information search is reduced, yet others have found contradictory effects. The present series of 5 studies consistently found that the crucial moderator for these inconsistent findings was whether the induced threat was contextually related to the subsequent decision and information search tasks. Contextual incongruence (e.g., an induction of terrorist threat followed by an economic decision case) results in reduced levels of confirmatory information search, whereas a congruent threat (e.g., an induction of terrorist threat followed by a decision case on terrorism) results in increased levels of confirmatory information search. Analyses of the underlying psychological processes revealed that decision-unrelated threat inductions increase decision makers' experienced decision uncertainty, thus reducing confirmatory information search.

In the article, all p-curve analyses examining the Context Moderation Hypothesis Prediction mistakenly included the p-value from Little, Jones, Burt, \& Perrett (2007) Study 2 for the simple effect of fertility on attraction to facial symmetry in a short-term relationship context (p{\textless} .001). The analyses should have instead included the p-value for the fertility X relationship context interaction (p = .011). In addition, the p-curve analyses examining exact two-tailed p-values for the Cycle Shift Prediction should have included an additional p-value from Provost et al. (2008) Study 1 for the main effect of fertility on attraction to gait masculinity. The reported p-value for this effect was .05, making it ineligible for inclusion in p-curves of reported p-values. However, the exact recalculated two-tailed p-value was .049, making it eligible for inclusion in p-curves of exact p-values. The corrected p-curve of exact two-tailed p-values evaluating the Cycle Shift Prediction and Context Moderation Prediction (displayed in Figure 2) now includes a total of 15 p-values (N = 1442) is no longer significantly right skewed χ 2(30) = 41.25, p = .08. The corrected p-curve of exact two-tailed p-values evaluating the Cycle Shift Prediction, Context Moderation Prediction, and Partner Qualities Moderation Prediction (displayed in Figure 3) now includes a total of 21 p-values (N = 1707) and continues to be significantly right skewed Χ²(42) = 69.83, p = .004. As part of this correction, the online supplemental materials have been updated.] Two meta-analyses evaluated shifts across the ovulatory cycle in women’s mate preferences but reported very different findings. In this journal, we reported robust evidence for the pattern of cycle shifts predicted by the ovulatory shift hypothesis (Gildersleeve, Haselton, \& Fales, 2014). However, Wood, Kressel, Joshi, and Louie (2014) claimed an absence of compelling support for this hypothesis and asserted that the few significant cycle shifts they observed were false positives resulting from publication bias, p-hacking, or other research artifacts. How could 2 meta-analyses of the same literature reach such different conclusions? We reanalyzed the data compiled by Wood et al. These analyses revealed problems in Wood et al.’s meta-analysis—some of which are reproduced in Wood and Carden’s (2014) comment in the current issue of this journal—that led them to overlook clear evidence for the ovulatory shift hypothesis in their own set of effects. In addition, we present right-skewed p-curves that directly contradict speculations by Wood et al.; Wood and Carden; and Harris, Pashler, and Mickes (2014) that supportive findings in the cycle shift literature are false positives. Therefore, evidence from both of the meta-analyses and the p-curves strongly supports genuine, robust effects consistent with the ovulatory shift hypothesis and contradicts claims that these effects merely reflect publication bias, p-hacking, or other research artifacts. Unfounded speculations about p-hacking distort the research record and risk unfairly damaging researchers’ reputations; they should therefore be made only on the basis of firm evidence.

In Studies 1 and 2, participants received false feedback regarding their relative acceptance and dominance in a laboratory group, and state self-esteem was assessed. Results indicated that acceptance and dominance feedback had independent effects on self-esteem. Study 2 showed that these effects were not moderated by individual differences in participants' self-reported responsivity to being accepted versus dominant. In Study 3, participants completed multiple measures of perceived dominance, perceived acceptance, and trait self-esteem. Results showed that both perceived dominance and perceived acceptance accounted for unique variance in trait self-esteem, but that perceived acceptance consistently accounted for substantially more variance than perceived dominance. Also, trait self-esteem was related to the degree to which participants felt accepted by specific people in their lives, but not to the degree to which participants thought those individuals perceived them as dominant.

773,Context matters: The benefits and costs of expressing positive emotion among survivors of childhood sexual abuse,"Positive emotions promote adjustment to aversive life events. However, evolutionary theory and empirical research on trauma disclosure suggest that in the context of stigmatized events, expressing positive emotions might incur social costs. To test this thesis, the authors coded genuine (Duchenne) smiling and laughter and also non-Duchenne smiling from videotapes of late-adolescent and young adult women, approximately half with documented histories of childhood sexual abuse ({CSA}), as they described the most distressing event of their lives. Consistent with previous studies, genuine positive emotional expression was generally associated with better social adjustment two years later. However, as anticipated, {CSA} survivors who expressed positive emotion in the context of describing a past {CSA} experience had poorer long-term social adjustment, whereas {CSA} survivors who expressed positive emotion while describing a nonabuse experience had improved social adjustment. These findings suggest that the benefits of positive emotional expression may often be context specific.

774,Taking time seriously: A theory of socioemotional selectivity,"Socioemotional selectivity theory claims that the perception of time plays a fundamental role in the selection and pursuit of social goals. According to the theory, social motives fall into 1 of 2 general categories–those related to the acquisition of knowledge and those related to the regulation of emotion. When time is perceived as open-ended, knowledge-related goals are prioritized. In contrast, when time is perceived as limited, emotional goals assume primacy. The inextricable association between time left in life and chronological age ensures age-related differences in social goals. Nonetheless, the authors show that the perception of time is malleable, and social goals change in 20–83 yr olds when time constraints are imposed. The authors argue that time perception is integral to human motivation and suggest potential implications for multiple subdisciplines and research interests in social, developmental, cultural, cognitive, and clinical psychology.

775,Open to death: A moderating role of openness to experience in terror management,"Research on terror management theory demonstrates that people respond to reminders of mortality with defenses aimed at maintaining their self-esteem and defending cultural worldviews. We posited that being open to experience should allow individuals to process death more receptively (i.e., with curiosity), attenuating the need to bolster self-esteem or defend worldviews, because death is a novel experience. Across three studies, dispositional openness moderated reactions to mortality salience. Individuals low in openness to experience responded to mortality salience with increased self-esteem striving (Study 1) and worldview defense (Study 2), and this functioned to decrease the subsequent availability of death-related thought (Study 2). Individuals high in openness to experience did not exhibit these same defense tendencies. Study 3 examined a possible mechanism for the attenuated effects observed among high openness individuals: increased curiosity in response to mortality salience was found to decrease worldview defense, but only for those high in openness. Together this research depicts openness as a resource facilitating reduced defensiveness following mortality salience.

Study 1 found that writing about being unemployed (vs. a control topic) led to greater mortality‐related cognition. Study 2 found that considering unemployment heightened death cognition, but only when participants were led to perceive the job market as unhealthy. Finally, Study 3 found that considering unemployment led to greater death cognition, but not for those involved in a close relationship.

777,The past makes the present meaningful: Nostalgia as an existential resource,"The present research tested the proposition that nostalgia serves an existential function by bolstering a sense of meaning in life. Study 1 found that nostalgia was positively associated with a sense of meaning in life. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that nostalgia increases a sense of meaning in life. In both studies, the link between nostalgia and increased meaning in life was mediated by feelings of social connectedness. Study 3 evidenced that threatened meaning increases nostalgia. Study 4 illustrated that nostalgia, in turn, reduces defensiveness following a meaning threat. Finally, Studies 5 and 6 showed that nostalgia disrupts the link between meaning deficits and compromised psychological well-being. Collectively, these findings indicate that the provision of existential meaning is a pivotal function of nostalgia.

779,"The risk of being shot at: Stress, cortisol secretion, and their impact on memory and perceived learning during reality-based practice for armed officers","A field experiment was organized during a handgun shooting workshop for armed officers (N = 36). In-depth stress analyses involved anticipatory distress, subjective stress, and salivary cortisol reactivity triggered by reality-based handgun shooting practice and, more specifically, by being in an uncontrollable situation with the risk of being shot at. Subsequently, the study examined to what extent exposure to reality-based stress affected working memory performances and self-perceived active learning. As expected, the risk of being shot at caused more anticipatory distress, subjective stress, and increasingly triggered cortisol secretion. Further results showed that, although stress endurance deteriorated working memory performance, participants in the high-realism group simultaneously self-perceivably learned more (i.e., acquired task-relevant skills and competencies). The dual stress effect may result from the professional appreciation of reality-based practice and increased self-efficacy toward hazardous real-life situations. Balancing the intersection between occupational psychology, cognitive psychology, and psychoneuroendocrinology, this study performed stress research in an important and rarely accessible professional setting.

780,A dyadic analysis of negative emotion personality predisposition effects with psychological distress in neonatal intensive care unit parents,"The relation of parents' personality predisposition to guilt, shame, and fear of death with symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression was examined in 67 couples who were the parents of sick newborn infants previously hospitalized in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The Actor-Partner Interdependence Model method of dyadic analysis was used to determine the relation of parents' predisposition to guilt, shame, and fear of death to their own posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression (actor effect), and to the posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression of their partners (partner effect). The couple members were not statistically distinguishable by gender. Guilt had a significant actor effect with posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression, and a significant partner effect with anxiety and depression. Guilt explained 15–18\% of the variance in these measures of psychological distress. Fear of death had a significant actor effect with all measures of psychological distress, but none of the partner effects was statistically significant. Shame did not predict posttraumatic stress or anxiety, but there was a significant actor effect with depression. Fear of death and shame explained only small proportions (3–6\%) of the variance in the psychological distress variables with which they had statistically significant relationships. The guilt effects with psychological distress were intrapersonal (actor) and interpersonal (partner), whereas the fear of death and shame effects were intrapersonal. These emotions, particularly fear of death and shame, tend to be elusive as well as aversive, but they are important forerunners of psychopathology and deserve specific attention in psychological counseling.

781,"Gender identity and adjustment in black, Hispanic, and white preadolescents","The generality of S. K. Egan and D. G. Perry's (2001) model of gender identity and adjustment was evaluated by examining associations between gender identity (felt gender typicality, felt gender contentedness, and felt pressure for gender conformity) and social adjustment in 863 White, Black, and Hispanic 5th graders (mean age = 11.1 years). Relations between gender identity and adjustment varied across ethnic/racial groups, indicating that S. K. Egan and D. G. Perry's model requires amendment. It is suggested that the implications of gender identity for adjustment depend on the particular meanings that a child attaches to gender (e.g., the specific attributes the child regards as desirable for each sex); these meanings may vary across and within ethnic/racial groups. Cross-ethnic/racial investigation can aid theory building by pointing to constructs that are neglected in research with a single ethnic/racial group but that are crucial components of basic developmental processes.

A qualitative descriptive study aimed to explore the features of thoughts, emotions and feelings about young people's own death, (nursing students) was conducted. 85 students voluntarily answered a self-administered questionnaire with open questions based on Mortality Salience, used in the Terror Management Theory. Content analysis using Atlas.ti software was performed. When reflecting upon their own death, participants reported substantive emotions such as fear, pain, distress, sadness or loneliness. The fear of their own death was specified as the inability to achieve goals in life, to leave the family and the dying process itself. When reflecting upon been physically dead, attributes of the decomposition of the body, spiritual attributes, beliefs, denial and preferences were identified. Cultural worldview, values and beliefs of each person were remarkably present when thinking about their own death.

783,Mortality salience increases death-thought accessibility and worldview defense among high broad autism phenotype ({BAP}) individuals,"The Broad Autism Phenotype ({BAP}) is an individual difference whereby persons exhibit mild characteristics of autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}), including being socially aloof and having a rigid personality. Given that individuals high in {BAP} rigidity have difficulty adjusting to change, the present research examined whether rigid persons report greater concerns about death and adhere to their cultural beliefs following mortality salience ({MS}). In Study 1, we found that {BAP} rigidity was positively associated with greater mortality-related concerns. In Study 2, high rigid individuals evidenced increased death-thought accessibility following {MS}. Finally, Study 3 found that {MS} led to heightened worldview defense for individuals high in rigidity, while decreasing defensiveness for those low in rigidity. These results provide evidence for the moderating role of individual differences in terror management effects. Specifically, {ASD} characteristics in young adults, particularly in the area of rigidity, contribute to heightened death concerns and greater defensiveness.

784,Effects of threats to groups on ingroup-prosocial behaviors and orientations,"This research investigates how threats to people's ingroups promote ways of thinking and behaving that benefit these groups (ingroup prosociality). Drawing on terror management theory and other relevant literature, I propose that threats promote ingroup prosociality, and that threats play an important role in explaining why members of collectivistic societies (e.g., Eastern) tend to exhibit more ingroup prosociality than members of individualistic societies (e.g., Western). Three experimental studies isolated effects of threats on outcomes I propose reflect ingroup prosociality: holistic versus analytic types of cognitive and social orientations (Study 1), upholding status orders in groups (Study 2), and promoting the legitimacy of power in groups (Study 3). To experimentally manipulate threat, participants wrote about either a threatening or non-threatening situation. In the group studies (2 and 3), the threat situation was also part of the task itself. Study 1 provides some support for increased ingroup prosociality when threatened, and some evidence for differences by culture and type of threat. Though results generally suggest that Americans respond more ingroup prosocially than Indians, they do not provide compelling evidence of consistent cross-cultural patterns as predicted. Study 2 provides only minimal support for threat increasing adherence to status orders. Study 3 provides a great deal of support for threat increasing promotion of the legitimacy of power structures, and results suggest especially strong responses among high-status participants with low-status partners. For each study, I also address some results in the opposite direction predicted. Taken together, the results only somewhat support my proposed ingroup prosociality worldview theory. Alternatively, patterns in results suggest that threatened ingroup members may be motivated to preserve their self-esteem and reduce their anxiety. Though this self-serving explanation is consistent with terror management theory, it is not consistent with the ingroup prosociality worldview initially proposed. Overall, the results provide evidence that threat (1) affects both behaviors and orientations (many proposed to reflect ingroup prosociality), which warrant consideration together as defensive responses to threats, and (2) increases promoting the legitimacy of power based on status in some situations. I discuss limitations, implications for theory and potential leadership interventions, and directions for future work.

785,Settling for less out of fear of being single,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 115(5) of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (see record [rid]2018-51567-002[/rid]). In the article, the Fear of Being Single Scale used in Study 3 was in fact a version adapted for those currently involved in relationships. In error, it was reported that participants completed the exact same Fear of Being Single Scale as in the other studies in the manuscript, with items generally worded as though participants were currently single (e.g., 'I feel it is close to being too late for me to find the love of my life'). The scale items in Study 3 were the same as those in the original scale but included qualifiers such as 'If I were single, it would be close to being too late for me to find the love of my life.'] The present research demonstrates that fear of being single predicts settling for less in romantic relationships, even accounting for constructs typically examined in relationship research such as anxious attachment. Study 1 explored the content of people’s thoughts about being single. Studies 2A and 2B involved the development and validation of the Fear of Being Single Scale. Study 2C provided preliminary support for the hypothesis that fear of being single predicts settling for less in ongoing relationships, as evidenced by greater dependence in unsatisfying relationships. Study 3 replicated this effect in a longitudinal study demonstrating that fear of being single predicts lower likelihood of initiating the dissolution of a less satisfying relationship. Studies 4A and 4B explored the predictive ability of fear of being single for self-reported dating standards. Across both samples, fear of being single was unrelated to self-reported standards for a mate, with the exception of consistently higher standards for parenting. Studies 5 and 6 explored romantic interest in targets that were manipulated to vary in responsiveness and physical attractiveness. These studies found that fear of being single consistently predicted romantic interest in less responsive and less attractive dating targets. Study 7 explored fear of being single during a speed-dating event. We found that fear of being single predicted being less selective in expressing romantic interest but did not predict other daters’ romantic interest. Taken together, the present research suggests that fear of being single is a meaningful predictor of settling for less in relationships.

786,When risk communication backfires: Randomized controlled trial on self-affirmation and reactance to personalized risk feedback in high-risk individuals,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 36(6) of Health Psychology (see record [rid]2017-22799-004[/rid]). Several errors appear in the data in the Results section. The corrected information is provided. It is noted that, in all cases, the statistical conclusions remain the same.] Objective: Health promotion often faces the problem that populations with high behavioral risk profiles respond defensively to health promotion messages by negating risk or reactant behavior. Self-affirmation theory proposes that defensive reactions are an attempt of the self-system to maintain integrity. In this article, we examine whether a self-affirmation manipulation can mitigate defensive responses to personalized visual risk feedback in the skin cancer prevention context (ultraviolet [{UV}] photography), and whether the effects pertain to individuals with high behavioral risk status (high personal relevance of tanning). Method: We conducted a full-factorial randomized controlled trial (N = 292; age 11–71) following a 2  2 design ({UV} photo yes/no, self-affirmation yes/no). Follow-up period was 2 weeks. Subsequent tanning behavior, sun avoidance intentions, and risk perception. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance ({MANOVA}) revealed a three-way interaction between risk feedback, the self-affirmation manipulation, and risk status for the three outcome measures. Follow-up analyses of variance ({ANOVAs}) indicated that high-risk individuals receiving only the risk feedback intervention reacted defensively and reported higher exposure. A self-affirmation manipulation mitigates this reactance effect both on the level of cognitions and behavior. Conclusion: Self-affirmation has influential implications not only for Social Psychology but also for health prevention measures. The findings support the effectiveness of self-affirmation in reducing reactant and defensive reactions to personalized visual risk feedback. Interactions with health risk status indicate that self-affirmation might increase the effectiveness of health promotion messages in high-risk populations.

Local, national, and international stability and security remain fragile across the globe, particularly owing to the human impacts caused by radical, extremist, and terrorist actors. This research demonstrates that manifestations of radicalization and extremism occur in all sectors of segregated human association.The purpose of this study was to determine the strategies required by global leaders to successfully reduce or neutralize radicalization and extremism across global populations. One hundred and eight global leaders from multiple, invested interest sectors participated to inform this basic qualitative study through semi-structured interviews. Leaders interviewed included professionals from policy, governance, theology, civil society, defense, media, academia, intergovernmental institutions, and field practitioner sectors.Participant inputs demonstrated the intricacies and complexities of the analytics and strategy considerations required to effectively reduce the human and societal impacts of radicalization and extremism observed globally. Data collected during this study confirmed that elements of radicalization and extremism are present across all sectors of society. Furthermore, findings support a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the gaps present in the current counter and preventative efforts. Perceptions and paradigms of readers and stakeholders will be challenged to actively consider the necessity of full-spectrum analysis of radicalization and extremism—findings directly contrast with commonly held narratives present today.

788,A metaphor-enriched social cognition,"Social cognition is the scientific study of the cognitive events underlying social thought and attitudes. Currently, the field's prevailing theoretical perspectives are the traditional schema view and embodied cognition theories. Despite important differences, these perspectives share the seemingly uncontroversial notion that people interpret and evaluate a given social stimulus using knowledge about similar stimuli. However, research in cognitive linguistics (e.g., Lakoff \& Johnson, 1980) suggests that people construe the world in large part through conceptual metaphors, which enable them to understand abstract concepts using knowledge of superficially dissimilar, typically more concrete concepts. Drawing on these perspectives, we propose that social cognition can and should be enriched by an explicit recognition that conceptual metaphor is a unique cognitive mechanism that shapes social thought and attitudes. To advance this metaphor-enriched perspective, we introduce the metaphoric transfer strategy as a means of empirically assessing whether metaphors influence social information processing in ways that are distinct from the operation of schemas alone. We then distinguish conceptual metaphor from embodied simulation—the mechanism posited by embodied cognition theories—and introduce the alternate source strategy as a means of empirically teasing apart these mechanisms. Throughout, we buttress our claims with empirical evidence of the influence of metaphors on a wide range of social psychological phenomena. We outline directions for future research on the strength and direction of metaphor use in social information processing. Finally, we mention specific benefits of a metaphor-enriched perspective for integrating and generating social cognitive research and for bridging social cognition with neighboring fields.

He is currently director of Israel’s Lev-Hasharon Medical Center for Mental Health, affiliated with Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, where he is Professor of Psychiatry. He is also chair of the National Council for Mental Health, and chairperson of the Professional Steering Committee of the Israel Trauma Center for Victims of Terror and War ({NATAL}). In his discussion of traumatic stress resilience, he draws upon subjective experiences as an Israeli and as a psychiatrist, clinician, therapist, teacher, and researcher. Among his Trauma Resilience Truisms, he underscores the importance of a leader in bolstering resilience, especially when the leader has the capacity to instill hope with a promising vision. Bleich emphasizes the importance of interpersonal factors on the collective level, such as sense of belonging, cohesion, solidarity, and mutual commitment. While highlighting the importance of individual empowerment in order to increase resilience as a society, Bleich notes that the authorities must strengthen vulnerable groups and communities by providing adequate resources to improve their capacity to cope and to continue to thrive. This is a subjective narrative, drawn from Bleich’s personal and professional experiences, through which he has identified sources of resilience and strength as they relate to interpersonal resources. The story of his personal and professional experiences, which reflect those of his contemporaries and colleagues, contributes to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resilience.

791,Stepping in the shoes of leaders of populist right-wing parties: Promoting anti-immigrant views in times of economic prosperity,"What narrative is deemed most compelling to justify anti-immigrant sentiments when a country’s economy is not a cause for concern? We predicted that flourishing economies constrain the viability of realistic threat arguments. We found support for this prediction in an experiment in which participants were asked to take on the role of speechwriter for a leader with an anti-immigrant message (N = 75). As predicted, a greater percentage of realistic threat arguments and fewer symbolic threat arguments were generated in a condition in which the economy was expected to decline than when it was expected to grow or a baseline condition. Perhaps more interesting, in the economic growth condition, the percentage realistic entitlements and symbolic threat arguments generated were higher than when the economy was declining. We conclude that threat narratives to provide a legitimizing discourse for anti-immigrant sentiments are tailored to the economic context.

793,How our mortal fate contributes to ageism: A terror management perspective - Ageism: Stereotyping and prejudice against older persons.,"Providing these types of experiences is a step in the right direction in terms of aiding the younger generation in confronting and coping with fears about older adults and their own aging processes, altering our social norms and viewing older people not through the lens of harmful cultural stereotypes but as individuals. So there are possibilities to be pursued. But what the terror management analysis suggests is that whatever we do to try to promote more accurate and positive attitudes and behaviors toward older adults, we have to do so in a way that is cognizant of the role of the fear of death in regard to attitudes and treatment of older individuals. With a more sober and realistic understanding of our own fears and reactions to older adults, we may be better able to understand ageism as something we are all prone to but nevertheless can combat. Movement in a positive direction can occur with attempts to buttress both young and old people's sense of value in this potentially lonely and horrifying universe, with the realization that the young can learn a great deal from the old about coping with aging and life's limitations and also about how courage, meaning, and passion might be preserved and remain 'strong enough to prevent us turning in upon ourselves'. With the recognition of the fact that one day the young will be old and will want to be treated with dignity, de Beauvoir writes, 'Let us recognize ourselves in this old man or in that old woman. It must be done if we are to take upon ourselves the entirety of our human state. And when it is done we will no longer acquiesce in the misery of the last age; we will no longer be indifferent, because we shall feel concerned, as indeed we are' We are concerned about our future and our fate, and so it would be a mistake not to try to understand better older adults for whom death is most likely closest (as is often painfully apparent) and better understand ourselves and our own fearful yet natural responses to aging and death. Imagine the benefits if we could all value, cherish, and emulate the wisdom and strength of older adults in dealing with something that, to our detriment as well as theirs, we try so hard to deny.

The average effect size of Team A (r = .41) was significantly greater than that of other researchers (r = .30).

795,"Psychosocial resources, threat, and the perception of distance and height: Support for the resources and perception model","Threatening things are often perceptually exaggerated, such that they appear higher, closer, of greater duration, or more intense than they actually are. According to the Resources and Perception Model ({RPM}) psychosocial resources can prevent this exaggeration, leading to more accurate perception. Two studies tested {RPM}. Study 1 showed that the perceived closeness of a threatening object (a live tarantula) but not an innocuous object (a cat toy) was moderated by induced self-worth. Further, the more self-worth that participants experienced, the less close the tarantula appeared to them. Study 2 showed that greater levels of self-esteem reduced perceived height, but only among participants prevented from holding a protective handrail while looking down. Together, these studies confirm that resources moderate the physical perception of both distance and height, that resources moderate perception of threats but not nonthreats, that different resources have similar moderating effects, and that psychosocial resources can supplant physical resources.

796,Implicit aggression following exposure to people with physical disabilities: The costs of inhibiting self-protective processes,"Previous studies indicate that death reminders elicit prosocial behavior, but also an urge to distance from physical disabilities. Here, we examine whether mortality salience will increase implicit aggression when one is explicitly requested to help a person with physical disability. This implicit negative response may address the need for self-protection when no other means are available. Participants were randomly assigned to a mortality salience or pain condition, were exposed to a veteran with a physical or emotional disability, and were requested or not to help him. Then, they performed a lexical decision task tapping accessibility of aggression-related cognitions. Mortality-salience participants who were exposed to a veteran with physical disability and were compelled to help showed higher accessibility of aggression-related thoughts than participants in other conditions. Findings support the Self-Protective Altruism hypothesis (Hirschberger in Soc Pers Psychol Compass 7:128–140, 2013), implying that sometimes prosocial behavior can involve implicit antisocial thoughts.

797,Ageist attitudes block young adults’ ability for compassion toward incapacitated older adults,"Background: Upon encountering older adults, individuals display varying degrees of prosocial attitudes and behaviors. While some display compassion and empathy, others draw away and wish to maintain their distance from them. The current study examined if and how ageist attitudes influence the association between the sight of physical incapacity in older age and compassionate reactions toward them. We predicted that ageist attitudes would interfere with the ability to respond to them with compassion. Methods: Young adults (N = 149, ages 19–29) were randomly distributed into two experimental conditions, each viewing a short video portraying different aspects of older adult physicality; one group viewed older adults displaying incapacitated behavior, and the other viewed fit behavior. Participants subsequently filled out scales assessing aging anxieties, and ageist and compassionate attitudes. Results: Ageism was associated with reduced compassion toward the figures. Moreover, viewing incapacitated older adults led to increased concern toward them and perceived efficacy in helping them. However, significant interactions proved that higher scores of ageism in response to the videos led to increased need for distance and reduced efficacy toward incapacitated adults, an effect not observed among subjects with lower ageism scores. Conclusions: Ageism seems to be a factor which disengages individuals from older adults displaying fragility, leading them to disregard social norms which dictate compassion. The results are discussed from the framework of terror management theory, as increased mortality salience and death-related thoughts could have led to the activation of negative attitudes which, in turn, reduce compassion.

798,Self-defeating behavior patterns among normal individuals: Review and analysis of common self-destructive tendencies,"Three conceptual models of self-defeating behavior can be distinguished on the basis of intentionality (desiring and foreseeing harm). In primary self-destruction, the person foresees and desires harm to self; in tradeoffs, the harm is foreseen but not desired; and in counterproductive strategies, the harm is neither foreseen nor desired. We review 12 categories of self-defeating behavior patterns from the research literature in social psychology. No clear evidence of primary self-destruction is found. Several tradeoff patterns have been shown: Typically, the individual favors short-term benefits despite long-term costs and risks, especially under the influence of aversive emotional states and high self-awareness. Counterproductive strategies have also been found, usually based on misjudging self or misjudging contingencies. It is concluded that normal people do harm themselves and defeat their projects by means of poor judgments, by maladaptive responses, through unforeseen consequences of nonoptimal methods, and by disregarding costs and risks in favor of immediate pleasure or relief; however, there is no clear evidence of intentional, deliberate self-destructiveness among normal (nonclinical) individuals.

The options are briefly sketched, and their virtues and blind spots highlighted.

We subliminally primed 72 undergraduates with either the word death or failed and assessed their attention to tactile and visual stimuli as a function of their body esteem. Results indicated that death primes significantly reduced attention to tactile stimuli relative to visual stimuli in low body esteem individuals.

801,Affirmed yet unaware: Exploring the role of awareness in the process of self-affirmation,"Three studies investigated whether self-affirmation can proceed without awareness, whether people are aware of the influence of experimental self-affirmations, and whether such awareness facilitates or undermines the self-affirmation process. The authors found that self-affirmation effects could proceed without awareness, as implicit self-affirming primes (utilizing sentence-unscrambling procedures) produced standard self-affirmation effects (Studies 1 and 3). People were generally unaware of self-affirmation’s influence, and self-reported awareness was associated with decreased impact of the affirmation (Studies 1 and 2). Finally, affirmation effects were attenuated when people learned that self-affirmation was designed to boost self-esteem (Study 2) or told of a potential link between self-affirmation and evaluations of threatening information (Study 3). Together, these studies suggest not only that affirmation processes can proceed without awareness but also that increased awareness of the affirmation may diminish its impact.

802,From what might have been to what must have been: Counterfactual thinking creates meaning,"Four experiments explored whether 2 uniquely human characteristics—counterfactual thinking (imagining alternatives to the past) and the fundamental drive to create meaning in life—are causally related. Rather than implying a random quality to life, the authors hypothesized and found that counterfactual thinking heightens the meaningfulness of key life experiences. Reflecting on alternative pathways to pivotal turning points even produced greater meaning than directly reflecting on the meaning of the event itself. Fate perceptions ('it was meant to be') and benefit-finding (recognition of positive consequences) were identified as independent causal links between counterfactual thinking and the construction of meaning. Through counterfactual reflection, the upsides to reality are identified, a belief in fate emerges, and ultimately more meaning is derived from important life events.

803,Believing in karma: The effect of mortality salience on excessive consumption,"This research proposes that mortality salience leads individuals to engage in differentiation of excessive consumption based on their appraisal of the karmic system. Study 1 demonstrated that mortality salience interacts with belief in karma to jointly determine excessive consumption, such that consumers faced with mortality salience tend to increase overconsumption likelihood when they have a weak (vs. strong) belief in karma. Study 2 revealed the underlying mechanism – temporal perspective – that drives our main effect. Replicating the findings of the two previous studies, study 3 further delineated benefit appeal as a theoretically derived boundary condition for the proposed interaction effect on excessiveness. Theoretical and, practical implications, as well as avenues for future research are discussed.

804,Unintended effects of measuring implicit processes: The case of death-thought accessibility in mortality salience studies,"According to terror management theory, mortality salience ({MS}) increases distal worldview and self-esteem defensiveness by arousing unconscious death-thought accessibility ({DTA}). Although numerous studies support this theoretical process model, no research to date has ever found that {DTA} mediates the effect of {MS} in a single study, using the measurement-of-mediation approach. In this paper, we argue that the lack of evidence for this effect is due to methodological issues associated with the measurement of {DTA}. Specifically, measuring {DTA} primes death-thoughts and thereby disrupts the psychological processes that are typically initiated by {MS}. We provide evidence for this theorizing in three studies. Study 1 shows that merely administering a {DTA} task (vs. a neutral non-death-related task) increases distal self-esteem enhancement following a delay period (cf., a typical {MS} effect). Study 2 is a preregistered replication of Study 1, and found parallel effects, but only among participants who did not speed through the study. Study 3 demonstrates that whereas {MS} increases self-enhancement after a delay when {DTA} is not measured, administering a {DTA} task following {MS} eliminates this effect. Implications for understanding the implicit processes initiated in response to {MS} are discussed, and methodological recommendations for conducting empirically sound {MS} studies are suggested.

805,Risk-resilience dynamics of ideological factors in distress after the evacuation from Gush Katif,"The aim of the present study was to examine the role of ideological commitment and national attachment in distress experienced by Jewish evacuees from Gaza and the West Bank, Israel ('Gush Katif'), 6 years after their forced evacuation. Fifty-one evacuees from Israeli settlements in Gush Katif completed web-administered self-report questionnaires tapping their levels of ideological commitment, national attachment, and psychological distress. Ideological commitment was found to be positively associated with stress (β = .33, p {\textless} .01) and depression (β = .25, p {\textless} .05). On the other hand, national attachment was found to be negatively associated with stress (β = −.24, p {\textless} .05) and depression (β = −.43, p {\textless} .001). A statistically significant interaction was found between national attachment and ideological commitment such that when ideological commitment was high, national attachment was associated with lower levels of depression, but when national attachment was low, ideological commitment was associated with higher levels of depression. Our findings are consistent with the conceptualization of a complex vulnerability-resilience dynamic in which different facets of political ideology may have complex and sometimes contradicting effects on psychological well-being.

806,Stress and accessibility of proximity-related thoughts: Exploring the normative and intraindividual components of attachment theory,"Three studies examine the effects of stress on the accessibility of proximity-related thoughts. In all the studies, participants reported on their attachment style, and the accessibility of proximity themes and worries in a lexical decision task was assessed upon the priming of a stress or neutral word. In Study 2, the primed stress word was semantically related to attachment themes. In Study 3, lexical decisions were made under low or high cognitive load conditions. Overall, the priming of a stress word led to increased accessibility of proximity themes, regardless of attachment style. Anxious–ambivalent people also showed high accessibility to proximity themes and worries in both neutral and stress contexts. In most conditions, avoidant persons' reactions were similar to those of secure persons. However, they showed no accessibility to proximity worries even after the priming of a semantically related word and reacted with high accessibility to these worries upon the addition of cognitive load.

807,Avoiding Death or Engaging Life as Accounts of Meaning and Culture: Comment on Pyszczynski et al (2004),"Terror management theory emphasizes that self-esteem consists of a sense of meaning and significance, which serves mainly to defend against death awareness. The current authors counter that people's search for meaning and significance cannot be wholly reduced to defensive processes because it also reflects intrinsic developmental processes. Sociometer theory similarly offers a mainly defensive account of self-esteem, and its exclusive focus on belongingness versus exclusion ill equips it to deal with the multiple needs underlying self-esteem. The current authors suggest that self-esteem resulting from defenses against anxiety (whether about death or exclusion) is akin to contingent self-esteem, whereas true self-esteem is based in ongoing satisfaction of needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

808,"Playboy playmates, the Dow Jones, consumer Sentiment, 9/11, and the doomsday clock: A critical examination of the environmental security hypothesis","Drawing on evolutionary social psychology, Pettijohn and Tesser's (1999) Environmental Security Hypothesis ({ESH}) proposes that during threatening times, people seek mates with more mature features. Pettijohn and Jungeberg (2004) found that Playboy Playmates of the Year ({PMOYs}), who are determined partly by popularity, exhibited more mature features (older, taller, heavier, larger waist-to-hip ratios [{WHRs}], lower body mass indexes [{BMIs}]) during times of hardship. Their composite measure of hard times, however, was heterogeneous; it was unclear weather the effects were driven by economic (unemployment) or existential (suicides, homicides) hardships. The present study critically examined the {ESH} by replicating and extending Pettijohn and Jungeberg while distinguishing between economic and existential threats. Forty-eight years (1960-2007) of {PMOY} measures (age, bust, waist, hips, height, weight, {WHR}, and {BMI}), two economic measures (Dow Jones industrial average [{DJIA}], consumer sentiment index [{CSI}]), and two existential threat measures (pre-versus-post-9/11 years, Doomsday Clock changes) were analyzed. Changes in economic indexes were either unassociated ({CSI}) or contrary ({DJIA}) to the {ESH}, such that taller, heavier women were preferred during prosperous markets. Supporting the {ESH}, increases in existential threats such as nuclear annihilation (Doomsday Clock) were related to older women and lower {BMIs}. The efficacy of the {ESH} is discussed.

According to optimal distinctiveness theory (M. B. Brewer, 1991), social identities serve the function of satisfying individuals' need for assimilation (in-group inclusion) and their need for differentiation (distinctiveness from others). It was proposed that one of the ways optimal social identities are maintained is through self-stereotyping. In 3 studies, the needs for assimilation and differentiation were experimentally manipulated, and support was found for increased self-stereotyping in response to heightened need arousal across both self-report and behavioral measures and across different social groups. Results also demonstrated that only those participants who were highly identified with their in-group were willing to engage in negative self-stereotyping.

810,Making and unmaking prejudice: Religious affiliation mitigates the impact of mortality salience on out‐group attitudes,"Research inspired by terror management theory has established that being reminded of the inevitability of death (i.e., 'mortality salience') leads people to express more negative attitudes toward out‐groups. We examined the hypothesis that being affiliated with a religion may buffer individuals against this negative impact of mortality salience. Two studies, conducted in two cultures that differ in their emphasis on religiosity (the United Kingdom and Italy), supported this hypothesis. Specifically, we found that mortality salience resulted in more negative out‐group attitudes only among participants not affiliated with any religion. Further, this buffering effect of religious affiliation was not moderated by participants’ specific religious orientations or by their levels of social dominance orientation. In addition, the buffering effect did not hold when prejudice against the target out‐group was not proscribed by religious authorities. Implications for research on religion, prejudice, and terror management are discussed.

811,Perceived discrimination as worldview threat or worldview confirmation: Implications for self-esteem,"In 3 studies, the authors tested the hypothesis that discrimination targets' worldview moderates the impact of perceived discrimination on self-esteem among devalued groups. In Study 1, perceiving discrimination against the ingroup was negatively associated with self-esteem among Latino Americans who endorsed a meritocracy worldview (e.g., believed that individuals of any group can get ahead in America and that success stems from hard work) but was positively associated with self-esteem among those who rejected this worldview. Study 2 showed that exposure to discrimination against their ingroup (vs. a non-self-relevant group) led to lower self-esteem, greater feelings of personal vulnerability, and ingroup blame among Latino Americans who endorsed a meritocracy worldview but to higher self-esteem and decreased ingroup blame among Latino Americans who rejected it. Study 3 showed that compared with women informed that prejudice against their ingroup is pervasive, women informed that prejudice against their ingroup is rare had higher self-esteem if they endorsed a meritocracy worldview but lower self-esteem if they rejected this worldview. Findings support the idea that perceiving discrimination against one's ingroup threatens the worldview of individuals who believe that status in society is earned but confirms the worldview of individuals who do not.

812,Lower subjective life expectancy in later life is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress symptoms among trauma survivors,"Objective: These studies examined whether exposure to traumatic events at different stages of life would predict posttraumatic stress symptoms ({PTSS}) in old age. Furthermore, the regulating role of perceptions that relate to one’s future time horizons (subjective life expectancy, {SLE}) and age (subjective age) were also examined. Method and Results: It was hypothesized that exposure to trauma would predict more {PTSS}, and that this association would be moderated by {SLE} and subjective age, so that for those with higher {SLE} and a younger subjective age, exposure to trauma will have a weaker association with {PTSS}. Study 1 (N = 294) revealed that among Israeli war veterans (mean age 57), those who experienced the trauma of war captivity in the Yom Kippur War reported higher {PTSS} than comparable veterans, and that the relationship between captivity and {PTSS} was weaker for those with a higher {SLE}. Study 2 (N = 339), which was based on older adults who were currently exposed to ongoing rocket fire in the south of Israel (mean age 65), revealed the same pattern of findings: Exposure to rocket fire predicted more {PTSS}, but this relationship was weaker among those with a higher {SLE}. Subjective age did not reveal a moderation effect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that different traumatic experiences, whether belonging to one’s past or whether currently ongoing, predict {PTSS} in later life. Moreover, it appears that subjective time horizons until death, but not subjective age since birth, can buffer against the negative effect of the trauma.

813,The curse and the blessing: The self as source of the terror and the primary avenue for managing it - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) is thus, in essence, a theory about the self and how to manage the terror of being self-conscious, which comes with the inevitable realization of one's mortal nature. As O. Rank (1936, 1978) noted, self-consciousness led to the problem of awareness of mortality in the first place, but it has also provided the cognitive bases for subsequently managing that problem and minimizing the terror that this realization can engender. Specifically, humans seek to establish and sustain a coherent sense of a valuable self-identity that will continue beyond physical death; this is the primary vehicle for managing this potential terror of death. This chapter focuses on some central ways in which the self is the source of both the problem and solution of terror management. It begins with delving into the nature of self and self-esteem, how they emerge and come to serve terror management, guided largely by E. Becker's (see record [rid]1972-22983-000[/rid]) The Birth and Death of Meaning. The chapter then reviews the {TMT} literature as it pertains to the roles of self-esteem, a coherent sense of self, self-awareness, and self-expansion in terror management. Finally, it points to some remaining questions and directions for further research.

814,How western sociocultural environment informs 'dying in place' in nursing homes,"This study explored the experiential nature of how aging seniors in a Western culture utilized principles of cultural assimilation to adapt to recurrent death-exposure. Worldwide, the aging society is growing and older adults are spending their final days in nursing homes that have high rates of mortality. The study addressed the problem of how sociocultural factors play a role in death-awareness, death-anxiety, and relationship value for residents with high-death exposure in a skilled nursing facility. Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory were the guiding frameworks for the study. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to explore the experiences of the participants through personal interviews. Purposive sampling was used to select 10 residents, aged 65 and over, from two skilled nursing facilities in Southeastern, United States. The purpose of the research was to explore Western cultural factors that might inform experiences of dying in place in skilled nursing facilities by answering three research questions associated with (1) death-proximity, (2) relationships, and (3) death-response. The results of this study align with Becker's (1973) seminal work, The Denial of Death. The findings of the study confirmed that the larger Western culture informed death-response in the skilled nursing facilities by means of propagating a subculture that mirrored the larger Western cultural worldview of a denial of death. A thematic coding process, assisted by epoché techniques and {NVivo} 12 {CAQDAS} software, identified six adaptive themes: ageism, avoidance, desensitization, communication, relationships, and religion. The implications of the study include linking {PTSD} symptomology to death-responses in the nursing homes. The study also provided increased knowledge of how anxiety buffers, in-group identity, entitativity, and interpersonal relationships function in respect to symbolic immortality and social engagement. The study will inform psychotherapy techniques and geriatric care practices used in skilled nursing facilities.

815,"Hopelessly mortal: The role of mortality salience, immortality and trait self-esteem in personal hope","Do people lose hope when thinking about death? Based on Terror Management Theory, we predicted that thoughts of death (i.e., mortality salience) would reduce personal hope for people low, but not high, in self-esteem, and that this reduction in hope would be ameliorated by promises of immortality. In Studies 1 and 2, mortality salience reduced personal hope for people low in self-esteem, but not for people high in self-esteem. In Study 3, mortality salience reduced hope for people low in self-esteem when they read an argument that there is no afterlife, but not when they read 'evidence' supporting life after death. In Study 4, this effect was replicated with an essay affirming scientific medical advances that promise immortality. Together, these findings uniquely demonstrate that thoughts of mortality interact with trait self-esteem to cause changes in personal hope, and that literal immortality beliefs can aid psychological adjustment when thinking about death. Implications for understanding personal hope, trait self-esteem, afterlife beliefs and terror management are discussed.

816,The pantheoretical nature of mental representations and their ability to predict interpersonal adjustment in a nonclinical sample,"This study sought to empirically examine some assumptions of contemporary psychoanalytic, attachment, and interpersonal personality theories by linking characteristics of mental representations of self and others (parents) to current levels of interpersonal adjustment in a nonclinical sample. To evaluate the mental representations of self and others, participants completed the Assessment of Qualitative and Structural Dimensions of Object Representations (S. J. Blatt, E. S. Chevron, D. M. Quinlan, C. E. Schaffer, \& S. Wein, 1992) and the Assessment of Self Descriptions (S. J. Blatt, S. A. Bers, \& C. E. Schaffer, 1993). Participants also completed the Experiences in Close Relationships (K. A. Brennan, C. L. Clark, \& P. R. Shaver, 1998) questionnaire to assess dimensions of adult attachment and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems–Circumplex Scales (L. E. Alden, J. S. Wiggins, \& A. L. Pincus, 1990) to assess current interpersonal adjustment. Our results suggest that (a) unique patterns of thematic and structural qualities of parental and self-representations are associated with interpersonal adjustment and (b) adult attachment mediates the relationship between object relations and interpersonal adjustment. These results cannot be explained by method invariance and support contemporary theories of mental representations, highlighting their pantheoretical and integrative nature.

817,What's in a name: Implicit self-esteem and the automatic self,"This article explores the links between implicit self-esteem and the automatic self (D. L. Paulhus, 1993). Across 4 studies, name letter evaluations were positively biased, confirming that implicit self-esteem is generally positive (A. G. Greenwald \& M. R. Banaji, 1995). Study 1 found that this name letter bias was stable over a 4-week period. Study 2 found that positive bias for name letters and positive bias for birth date numbers were correlated and that both biases became inhibited when participants were induced to respond in a deliberative manner. Studies 3–4 found that implicit self-evaluations corresponded with self-reported self-evaluations, but only when participants were evaluating themselves very quickly (Study 3) or under cognitive load (Study 4). Together, these findings support the notion that implicit self-esteem phenomena are driven by self-evaluations that are activated automatically and without conscious self-reflection.

Converging evidence that self-esteem serves an anxiety-buffering function,"Three studies were conducted to assess the proposition that self-esteem serves an anxiety-buffering function. In Study 1, it was hypothesized that raising self-esteem would reduce anxiety in response to vivid images of death. In support of this hypothesis, Ss who received positive personality feedback reported less anxiety in response to a video about death than did neutral feedback Ss. In Studies 2 and 3, it was hypothesized that increasing self-esteem would reduce anxiety among individuals anticipating painful shock. Consistent with this hypothesis, both success and positive personality feedback reduced Ss' physiological arousal in response to subsequent threat of shock. Thus, converging evidence of an anxiety-buffering function of self-esteem was obtained.

819,Attentional effects of self-affirmation in response to graphic antismoking images,"Objective: Self-affirmation has been shown to reduce defensive responding to threatening information. However, little is known about the cognitive and attentional processes underlying these effects. In the current eye-movement study, the authors explored whether self-affirmation affects attention allocation (i.e., number of fixations) among those for whom a threatening health message is self-relevant. Methods: After a self-affirmation manipulation, 47 smokers and 52 nonsmokers viewed a series of cigarette packs displaying high or low threat smoking-related images accompanied by a brief smoking message containing risk, coping or neutral textual information. Results: Self-affirmed smokers made more fixations to the cigarette packs than did nonaffirmed smokers (across both high and low threat images), whereas self-affirmed nonsmokers made fewer fixations to the cigarette packs than did nonaffirmed nonsmokers (again across both image types). The textual information did not moderate responses. Conclusions: Findings indicate attention-increasing effects of self-affirmation among those for whom the information is self-relevant (smokers) and attention-decreasing effects of self-affirmation among those for whom the information is not self-relevant (nonsmokers). Such findings are consistent with the calibration model of self-affirmation (Griffin \& Harris, 2011) in which self-affirmation increases sensitivity to the self-relevance of health-risk information. The use of an implicit measure of visual orienting informs our understanding of the working mechanisms of self-affirmation when encoding health information, and may also hold practical implications for the design and delivery of graphic warning labels.

820,Self-affirmation and self-control: Affirming core values counteracts ego depletion,"Research has established that acts of self-control deplete a resource required for subsequent self-control tasks. The present investigation revealed that a psychological intervention—self-affirmation—facilitates self-control when the resource has been depleted. Experiments 1 and 2 found beneficial effects of self-affirmation on self-control in a depleted state. Experiments 3 and 4 suggested that self-affirmation improves self-control by promoting higher levels (vs. lower levels) of mental construal. Self-affirmation therefore holds promise as a mental strategy that reduces the likelihood of self-control failure.

821,How does top management team composition matter for continual growth? Reinvestigating Penrose’s growth theory through the lens of upper echelons theory,"Purpose: Penrose’s argument regarding the managerial constraint on continual expansion over two consecutive periods is termed the 'Penrose effect,' a relatively less investigated premise in Penrose’s growth theory. The purpose of this paper is to empirically re-examine the Penrose effect from the perspective of upper echelons theory and investigated how top management team ({TMT}) composition influences the continual growth of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: This study empirically tested the hypotheses based on a sample of listed manufacturing firms operating in Taiwan, a newly industrialized economy in the Asia–Pacific region. Moderated hierarchical regression analyses were applied to test hypotheses. Findings: The empirical results suggest that low {TMT} diversity (in terms of educational, functional and team tenure diversity) is likely to engender a situation in which the Penrose effect might occur. Additionally, the results indicate that the proportion of functional executives plays a significant role in influencing the growth trend over two consecutive periods and may soften the impact of the Penrose effect. Practical implications: This paper suggests that appropriate structuring of {TMTs} and appropriate management of their members’ backgrounds and team tenure diversity can help firms overcome the Penrose effect and grow continually. Furthermore, the proportion of functional executives in a {TMT} is influential. Originality/value: This paper uniquely contributes to the theoretical and empirical development of Penrose’s growth theory, upper echelons theory and resource-based view concerning managerial resources.

822,Promoting a department of peace: An exploration of affective states and political perceptions,"Two studies investigated the relationship between emotions and political proposals affecting national security. Study One examined the extent to which proposals, ostensibly undertaken to produce security, may actually increase anxiety. Participants (N=131) were exposed to proposals for either missile defense or a Department of Peace, which either included or excluded information concerning the proposal's author. Neither proposal affected general anxiety level, but participants exposed to the proposal for missile defense reported feeling less secure that the nation could be protected from attack. Belief in efficacy was relatively low, significantly lower than the modest belief in efficacy reported by those exposed to the proposal for a Department of Peace. Ratings of effectiveness were not significantly biased by author affiliation. Study Two examined the impact of induced affective state on judgments of program efficacy. University students (N=36) were emotionally primed with comforting or threatening stimuli intended to affect feelings of anxiety. They were then exposed to either a proposal for missile defense or a proposal for a Department of Peace and asked to rate the proposal's effectiveness. Priming efforts were successful in manipulating feelings of anxiety, but perceived efficacy was not affected. However, level of anxiety was positively correlated with the judged efficacy of missile defense and negatively correlated with the efficacy of a Department of Peace. Participants rated a Department of Peace as more effective than a missile defense program. Their comments suggest ways for engendering public support for the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace.

823,Civil courage and helping behavior: Differences and similarities,"The present research reveals that people's implicit theories of civil courage and helping behavior are clearly distinguishable. In three studies, it was shown that situations requiring civil courage rather than helping assistance were perceived more quickly and were associated with greater perceived responsibility, less perceived intervention skills, a lower degree of expected positive social consequences, a higher degree of expected negative social consequences, a higher salience of societal norms, more evaluation apprehension, anger, and more empathy. Moreover, results revealed that the decisions on whether or not to engage in either civil courage or helping behavior are differentially influenced by perceived responsibility (the influence was greater for the decision to help than for the decision to show civil courage) and empathy (empathy was only important for the decision to help, but not for the decision to show civil courage). Implications of these results are discussed and the question of whether the determinants of helping behavior are also responsible for civil courage is pursued in detail.

Experiments 1 and 2 included the manipulation of stigma using facial birthmarks. Experiment 3 included manipulations of race and socioeconomic status. Threat responses were measured physiologically, behaviorally, and subjectively. Perceivers interacting with stigmatized partners exhibited cardiovascular reactivity consistent with threat and poorer performance compared with participants interacting with nonstigmatized partners, who exhibited challenge reactivity. In Experiment 3, intergroup contact moderated physiological reactivity such that participants who reported more contact with Black persons exhibited less physiological threat when interacting with them. These results support the stigma–threat hypothesis and suggest the utility of a biopsychosocial approach to the study of stigma and related constructs.

825,'My bus is here': A phenomenological exploration of 'living-with-dying',"Objectives: This article has 2 aims. The first is to demonstrate how the application of an innovative qualitative methodology generated novel insights into the experience of living with advanced cancer. The article’s second aim is to challenge the idea that the identification of shared themes provides the researcher with access to the meaning and significance of the experience of 'living-with-dying.' Method: The research used object elicitation together with existentially informed hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. The analysis is based on 10 semistructured interviews with people who are living with advanced cancer. Results: Three brief case studies demonstrate the variability in accounts that characterizes the data set as a whole. This is followed by reflections on the way in which, despite striking individual differences, all participants seemed to experience living-with-dying as an existential challenge that demands that the individual concerned finds a way of coming to terms with the very parameters of human existence. Conclusion: A thoroughly idiographic approach that advocates staying with the diversity that characterizes the experience of living with advanced cancer. It is argued that to make sense of the remarkable differences between the research participants’ accounts of their experiences of living with a diagnosis of advanced cancer, a focus on process (i.e., What happens when people encounter their mortality?) and meaning (i.e., What does it mean to them?) helps us to understand these as different responses to the challenge of death awareness.

826,Exploring the stress-buffering effects of religiousness in relation to social and economic change: Evidence from Poland,"Religiousness has been found to act as a protective factor against the adverse effects of stressors originating from a variety of sources. Despite ample precedent in sociological theories of religion, however, the potential stress-buffering role of religiousness in relation to stressors arising from macrolevel societal trends has not received empirical scrutiny. Recent psychological conceptualizations of social and economic change ({SEC}) suggest that such change manifests itself in people’s lives in the form of perceived demands that act as individual-level stressors and impinge on subjective well-being ({SWB}). Building on this line of research, we examined whether religious attendance and subjective religiosity buffered the negative association between perceived work-related demands of {SEC} and depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and work satisfaction in a sample of 1,581 Polish adolescents and adults aged 16 to 46 years. Analyses revealed that both dimensions of religiousness were positively related to {SWB} and buffered the impact of work-related demands on depressive symptoms. Contrariwise, no buffering effect of religiousness on either life or work satisfaction was found. Taken together, results partly confirm religiousness as a protective factor for {SWB} in relation to {SEC} but underscore the importance of taking the multifaceted nature of the construct into account in evaluating the interplay of stressors and religiousness.

827,Reactions to a Black professional: Motivated inhibition and activation of conflicting stereotypes,"The motivation to form a particular impression of an individual can prompt the inhibition of applicable stereotypes that contradict one's desired impression and the activation and application of stereotypes that support it. Participants, especially those high in prejudice, inhibited the Black stereotype when motivated to esteem a Black individual (because he had praised them). Participants motivated to esteem a Black doctor also activated the doctor stereotype. In contrast, participants motivated to disparage a Black doctor (because he had criticized them) inhibited the doctor stereotype. Participants motivated to disparage a Black individual also applied the Black stereotype to him, rating him as relatively incompetent. All these effects were driven by the self-protective motives of recipients of feedback from Black evaluators; detached observers showed no such effects.

828,The contingent effect of {TMT} international experience on firms’ internationalization speed,"Drawing on upper echelons theory, we argue that there will be an inverted U‐curve‐shaped relationship between the top management team's ({TMT}'s) level of international experience and a firm's internationalization speed. Accounting for the role of executive job demands highlighted in upper echelons theory, we further suggest that competitive pressure, product diversification and geographic scope moderate the relationship between {TMT} international experience and internationalization speed by increasing the demands of {TMT} managers’ jobs. Using data on the international expansion of 91 retailers between 2003 and 2012, we find empirical support for the inverted U‐curve‐shaped effect of {TMT} international experience and the moderating role of competitive pressure. We find no moderating effect of product diversification or geographic scope. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Mohr, Alex and Batsakis, Georgios",0,,828
829,"Death priming in investigations: The effects on worldview threat, out-group derogation, and stereotyping","Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) hypothesizes that thinking about one's own death creates a need to boost our worldview and our self-esteem in order to cope with this existential threat. Decades of research support the theory's premises with findings in many different settings (Burke, Martens, \& Faucher, 2010). The purpose of this dissertation is to extend the findings of {TMT} to research on decision making in investigations. In two studies, I evaluated how thinking about one's death (Mortality Salience, {MS}) affected mock investigators' reactions to the outcome of a case they investigated and their perceptions of a suspect, depending on their group memberships. In Study 1, participants (n = 299) were either death primed or not and asked to provide their assessment of a case as a police investigator. They were then told of the outcome of the case in court (either fair or unfair), asked how they felt about it. They were also asked how they would investigate a similar case in the future to assess for the impact of outcome on motivational bias. Results showed only an effect for outcome, where participants reacted more positively (and less negatively) to the fair outcome then the unfair outcome. Participants also showed a tendency to generally seek out more information in the unfair outcome condition; however, there was no sign of increased confirmation bias. In Study 2 (n = 403), I either primed participants with {MS} or not and manipulated what role they took on to investigate the case (police investigator or journalist), and the race of the suspect (either in-group or out-group member of different races (Black, Hispanic, or White) depending on their own). I then asked participants to provide their assessment of the suspect's culpability and their overall impressions of him. Results showed that, contrary to predictions, {MS} decreased mock police investigators' probability of guilt judgments as compared to those taking on the role of a journalist and those not death primed. There was also no clear evidence of increased stereotype use under {MS}. Results were discussed; limitations and avenues for future research were proposed.

830,Mortality salient banner advertisements affect brand choice in online shopping,"To what extent does peripherally visible information in online shopping environments (e.g., banner advertising) affect consumers' product choices? Evidence from Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) studies has demonstrated that mortality salient ({MS}) content---content that reminds people of death---can influence people to favor high-status brands. {TMT} studies have also demonstrated effects of {MS} even when {MS} content is only peripherally present (e.g., a nearby funeral home). The hypothesis tested here is that peripheral information in Web shopping may have a similar effect: people exposed to {MS} banner ads should choose high-status brands more often than people who are exposed to non-{MS} banner ads, perhaps even if---or especially when---they are 'banner blind,' not (consciously) noticing banner ads. The strategy in the study was to ask online participants to shop on a customized fictitious e-commerce Web site (displaying T-shirts, watches, chocolates and automobiles), with either {MS} or non-{MS} banner ads on the shopping pages, and afterwards to rank each product for status. A preliminary study demonstrated that the bespoke online shopping environment was suitable for measuring {MS} effects using standard focally presented {MS} stimuli: participants who wrote short essays about their own death were more likely to choose higher-status products than participants who wrote about dental pain. Additional pretests demonstrated that the {MS} banner ads selected for the study, when displayed on the shopping site, were able to show a standard {MS} effect: increased activation of death-related thoughts in a word-stem completion task. In the main study, mortality-salient banner ads marginally increased online shoppers' likelihood of selecting higher-status automobiles. Among the 136 'banner blind' participants---but not the 59 participants who accurately recognized at least one banner ad (recognition level of d' {\textgreater}= 1.0)---mortality-salient banner ads significantly increased shoppers' likelihood of selecting higher-status items across all four product categories. The effects of {MS} banner ads were particularly evident among participants who rated themselves as more Brand Conscious, as well as among participants who were healthier and younger. Additional analyses did not demonstrate reliable {MS} effects of participants' Materialism, Product Perfectionism, Price and Value Consciousness, Spirituality/Religiosity, Mindfulness, Income and Education.

Comparisons indicated that the African American participants reported higher levels of value conflicts and collective esteem, but lower levels of social support. They also reported more health actions (i.e., absenteeism and doctor visits) likely to create organizational costs. Value conflicts and the 3 coping resources predicted health-related behavior Collective esteem predicted health only for African American workers, though social support was a significant predictor only for European American workers.

832,Driven by fear: The effect of success and failure information on passionate individuals' performance,"Four studies investigated the impact of success and failure information on passionate individuals' performance. Obsessive passion, characterized by a rigid and defensive mode of functioning, predicted greater performance in domains both related and unrelated to the passionate activity in response to exposure to failure information. Conversely, harmonious passion, characterized by a flexible, nondefensive mode of functioning, was found to be unaffected by success or failure information. These performance effects were deeply ingrained, did not require conscious thought, and were automatically activated after unconscious exposure to failure-related words. In addition, the present research evinced that following failure information, obsessive passion predicted increases of performance through its effect on fear of failure. However, performance augmented only when the performance task was framed in such a way that failure would entail important negative consequences for the self and not when framed as inconsequential.

833,"The thrill of victory, the complexity of defeat: Self-esteem and people's emotional reactions to success and failure","Low self-esteem people are assumed to have more severe emotional reactions to failure than are high self-esteem people, but this assumption has not received consistent empirical support. In this article the authors report 2 investigations that found that self-esteem differences of this sort emerge for emotions that directly implicate the self (e.g., pride, humiliation) but not for emotions that do not directly implicate the self (e.g., happiness, unhappiness). Additional evidence suggested that this occurs, in part, because low self-esteem people overgeneralize the negative implications of failure.

Given the widespread use of {SNSs}, the purpose of the present set of studies was to examine the impact of chronic and temporary exposure to social media-based social comparison information on self-esteem. Using a correlational approach, Study 1 examined whether frequent Facebook use is associated with lower trait self-esteem. Indeed, the results showed that participants who used Facebook most often had poorer trait self-esteem, and this was mediated by greater exposure to upward social comparisons on social media. Using an experimental approach, Study 2 examined the impact of temporary exposure to social media profiles on state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations. The results revealed that participants’ state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations were lower when the target person’s profile contained upward comparison information (e.g., a high activity social network, healthy habits) than when the target person’s profile contained downward comparison information (e.g., a low activity social network, unhealthy habits). Results are discussed in terms of extant research and their implications for the role of social media in well-being.

836,An investigation of the relationship between adult attachment styles and attitudes toward death and dying,"Despite the vast empirical exploration of attachment theory throughout lifespan, the literature is devoid of studies exploring the relationship between attachment and death attitudes. There have been very few studies that connected the two concepts utilizing relatively new terror management and meaning management theories. Even fewer studies included both negative (death fear) and positive (death acceptance) attitudes toward death. This study explored the relationship between adult attachment styles and death attitudes measured by the Experiences in Close Relationship–Revised and the Death Attitude Profile–Revised questionnaires. The measures were completed by 201 adults with a cancer diagnosis who reside in the United States. Series of Spearman's correlations revealed that securely attached individuals are more likely to exhibit neutral death acceptance and insecurely attached individuals are more likely to experience escape death acceptance. Also, high attachment anxiety was associated with fear of death, death avoidance, and escape acceptance; and high attachment avoidance was associated with escape acceptance. Series of multiple regressions including demographic factors revealed many of the explored factors affected the relationship between adult attachment and death attitudes. Adding demographic factors to the model, such as age, education, religion, religious, and pain made the model stronger. Attachment anxiety predicted positively fear of death, avoidance of death acceptance, and escape death acceptance. Although attachment styles seem to be associated with death attitudes, death attitudes were predicted only by attachment anxiety. Presented and additional demographic variables should be further explored along with intergroup differences to allow generalization of these findings.adult attachment styles ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Choreva, Kristina",0,,836
837,Terror in time: Extending culturomics to address basic terror management mechanisms,"Building on Google’s efforts to scan millions of books, this article introduces methodology using a database of annual word frequencies of the 40,000 most frequently occurring words in the American literature between 1800 and 2009. The current paper uses this methodology to replicate and identify terror management processes in historical context. Variation in frequencies of word usage of constructs relevant to terror management theory (e.g. death, worldview, self-esteem, relationships) are investigated over a time period of 209 years. Study 1 corroborated previous {TMT} findings and demonstrated that word use of constructs related to death and of constructs related to patriotism and romantic relationships significantly co-vary over time. Study 2 showed that the use of the word 'death' most strongly co-varies over time with the use of medical constructs, but also co-varies with the use of constructs related to violence, relationships, religion, positive sentiment, and negative sentiment. Study 3 found that a change in the use of death related words is associated with an increase in the use of fear related words, but not in anxiety related words. Results indicate that the described methodology generates valuable insights regarding terror management theory and provide new perspectives for theoretical advances.

838,Prejudice and terror management at trial: Effects of defendant race/ethnicity and mortality salience on mock-jurors’ verdict judgments,"Following a mortality salience or control prime, Black, Hispanic, and White college students read a murder/carjacking or auto theft trial transcript in which the defendant belonged to their racial/ethnic group or one of the others. Black and Hispanic, but not White, mock-jurors discriminated, more frequently judging outgroup defendants guilty. Mortality salience affected judgments about outgroup, but not ingroup, defendants, heightening perceptions of guilt in the murder case and decreasing guilty verdict preferences in the theft case. Mortality salience may compel derogation of outgroup defendants who threaten the cultural worldview, but not of less threatening ingroup defendants. The effect, however, seems restricted to crimes like murder that can sustain death-related anxiety.

839,Inhibition underlies the effect of high need for closure on cultural closed-mindedness under mortality salience,"The hypothesis that people respond to reminders of mortality with closed-minded, ethnocentric attitudes has received extensive empirical support, largely from research in the Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) tradition. However, the basic motivational and neural processes that underlie this effect remain largely hypothetical. According to recent neuropsychological theorizing, mortality salience ({MS}) effects on cultural closed-mindedness may be mediated by activity in the behavioral inhibition system ({BIS}), which leads to passive avoidance and decreased approach motivation. This should be especially true for people motivated to avoid unfamiliar and potentially threatening stimuli as reflected in a high need for closure ({NFC}). In two studies involving moderated mediation analyses, people high on trait {NFC} responded to {MS} with increased {BIS} activity (as indicated by {EEG} and the line bisection task), which is characteristic of inhibited approach motivation. {BIS} activity, in turn, predicted a reluctance to explore foreign cultures (Study 1) and generalized ethnocentric attitudes (Study 2). In a third study, inhibition was induced directly and caused an increase in ethnocentrism for people high on {NFC}. Moreover, the effect of the inhibition manipulation × {NFC} interaction on ethnocentrism was explained by increases in {BIS}-related affect (i.e., anxious inhibition) at high {NFC}. To our knowledge, this research is the first to establish an empirical link between very basic, neurally-instantiated inhibitory processes and rather complex, higher-order manifestations of intergroup negativity in response to {MS}. Our findings contribute to a fuller understanding of the cultural worldview defense phenomenon by illuminating the motivational underpinnings of cultural closed-mindedness in the wake of existential threat.

840,The mnemonic mover: Nostalgia regulates avoidance and approach motivation,"In light of its role in maintaining psychological equanimity, we proposed that nostalgia—a self-relevant, social, and predominantly positive emotion—regulates avoidance and approach motivation. We advanced a model in which (a) avoidance motivation triggers nostalgia and (b) nostalgia, in turn, increases approach motivation. As a result, nostalgia counteracts the negative impact of avoidance motivation on approach motivation. Five methodologically diverse studies supported this regulatory model. Study 1 used a cross-sectional design and showed that avoidance motivation was positively associated with nostalgia. Nostalgia, in turn, was positively associated with approach motivation. In Study 2, an experimental induction of avoidance motivation increased nostalgia. Nostalgia then predicted increased approach motivation. Studies 3–5 tested the causal effect of nostalgia on approach motivation and behavior. These studies demonstrated that experimental nostalgia inductions strengthened approach motivation (Study 3) and approach behavior as manifested in reduced seating distance (Study 4) and increased helping (Study 5). The findings shed light on nostalgia’s role in regulating the human motivation system.

841,The utility of a positive body image among community-dwelling older adults who perceive death to be near and fear it,"Physical changes are an inevitable part of the aging process. However, research has demonstrated inconclusive findings with regard to body image among older adults. This study attempts to clarify the utility of body image among this age-group, by adopting the framework of terror management theory. It is suggested that a positive body image may moderate the connection between two types of death concerns and psychological distress: subjective nearness-to-death and death anxiety. A convenience sample of 386 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60–97, filled scales measuring subjective nearness-to-death, positive body image, psychological distress, and death anxiety. A significant negative association was found between a positive body image and distress. Moreover, positive body image moderated the connection between distress and both subjective nearness-to-death and death anxiety. Thus, holding a positive image of the body seems to be an important resource for older adults when death is perceived to be near.

Five experiments show that both mortality and uncertainty salience influence people's reactions to violations and bolstering of their cultural worldviews, yielding evidence for both terror and uncertainty management theories. Interestingly, the five experiments consistently reveal that uncertainty salience has a bigger impact on people's reactions than mortality salience, suggesting that the former may be a more important antecedent of reactions to norms and values than the latter. Findings further suggest that uncertainty salience did not instigate death-thoughts whereas reactions to norms and values were stronger among mortality salient participants who thought of uncertainty as a result of the mortality salience manipulation than mortality salient participants who did not think of uncertainty following this manipulation.

843,Understanding beliefs about mental illness and intentions to seek mental health treatment: A terror management paradigm,"Research on Terror Management Theory has suggested that individuals manage anxiety associated with nonconscious thoughts of death by reminding themselves that they are valuable members of a meaningful world. These defensive responses to threats of death may be manifested by engaging in self-esteem enhancing behaviors or acting in ways that align with one's cultural worldview. Studies have examined Terror Management Theory in the context of physical health in order to understand factors contributing to health-promoting and health-defeating behaviors. The current study was an extension of such research, where self-reported mental health and intentions to seek help for mental health problems were assessed in relation to contingencies of self-esteem and cultural/societal worldview. It was hypothesized that individuals whose self-esteem was contingent upon being mentally healthy and who had negative attitudes about or perceived stigma associated with mental illness or help-seeking would be more likely to report fewer mental health problems and less likely to report intentions to seek help if experiencing mental health problems after being reminded of their mortality (experimental group), as opposed to thoughts of dental pain (control group). The main hypotheses were not substantiated. Future research addressing limitations in the design and administration of the study, and use of more reliable measures may provide more information about the role of mortality salience in adaptive or maladaptive mental health care engagement. Within-gender trends suggest preliminary evidence of the influence of gender in mental health perceptions and decision-making that may be worth examining more closely in future research. Females who reported greater dispositional self-esteem and had less stigmatized attitudes associated with mental illness were more likely to report better mental health when reminded of their mortality. For females, low perceptions of stigma were also associated with better self-reported mental health and intentions to seek help. After a mortality salience induction, when males anticipated worse self-esteem due to mental health problems or perceived greater stigma associated with seeking help, they were more likely to report better mental health. If future research reveals stronger evidence for these within-gender trends in self-reported mental health and intentions to seek help, it could be attributed to socialized and stereotyped attitudes about mental health and help-seeking, which may be more influential when mortality is salient. By expanding previous research on physical health to the domain of mental health, this study demonstrates how researchers can creatively build upon {TMT} research. For example, this type of research may explain biased perceptions of mental health stability and reluctance to seek treatment for individuals whose mortality is particularly salient such as military service members. Future research that contributes to {TMT} literature may lead to greater specificity in conceptualization of the theory and better predictions within hypotheses.

844,Perceived mortality and perceived morality: Perceptions of value-orientation are more likely when a decision is preceded by a mortality reminder,"The questions addressed in this paper are whether and how reported mortality reminders can function as an indication of sincerity when communicating ambiguously motivated decisions. In two experiments, participants were exposed to a fictitious {CEO} who announced a decision to implement new organizational measures that were both environmentally and financially beneficial. In the experimental condition, the {CEO} attributed her new ideas to a recent mortality reminder. In the active control condition, the {CEO} attributed her decision to a non-lethal dentistry health scare, and in the passive control condition the {CEO} did not give any account of events preceding her decision. When a {CEO} implemented new corporate initiatives after a mortality reminder, her motivation for doing so was perceived as somewhat more motivated by intrinsic values, and significantly less motivated by financial gains. This change in attribution patterns was demonstrated to be indirectly related to a positive evaluation of the {CEO}, as well as an increased willingness to pay for the organization’s services. The second experiment further demonstrated that the reduced attribution to financial motivation associated with mortality awareness persisted even when the {CEO} in question was known for placing a high personal priority on financial goal attainment. The findings underscore the importance of perceived value-oriented motivation when communicating climate change mitigating policies, and the role of mortality awareness as one of many ways to induce such attributions.

845,Intentions and other symbolic contributions to society,"Much of human social behavior in modern societies entails symbolic contributions. According to the concept introduced here, symbolic contributions serve a substitute function, allowing individuals to continue to be accepted by society even when they are incapable of direct, or so-called 'actual' contributions (e.g., math skills, language skills, social and moral competence). Symbolic contributions, such as verbal statements of intention to act, become necessary psychologically when the person lacks training/experience or is not free to act. Thus, lack of ability or absence of occasion to act leads to adopting symbolic forms of contributions. Correspondingly, people would not take these symbolic routes if they were competent, experienced, and in contexts that enabled them to act directly.

846,Ebola as an existential threat? Experimentally-primed Ebola reminders intensify national-security concerns among extrinsically religious individuals,"One of religion’s psychological functions is to buffer against existential anxieties. This function may be especially pronounced among extrinsically religious individuals, who tend to harness religion for its personal and social benefits (e.g., emotional security, strengthened ingroup ties). Hence, in 2 experimental priming studies conducted within weeks of the first confirmed case of Ebola in the U.S., we examined whether extrinsically religious persons were especially likely to experience Ebola reminders as an existential threat that intensified national-security concerns (e.g., supporting strict travel bans, border security, and immigration laws). In Experiment 1 (N = 368), extrinsic religiousness was more strongly associated with national-security concerns in the Ebola prime, relative to a control group. In Experiment 2 (N = 532), we added a mortality salience condition. Replicating Experiment 1, extrinsic religiousness was more strongly associated with national-security concerns in both the Ebola prime and mortality salience conditions, relative to a control group. Taken together, large-scale existential threats may be especially likely to intensify pro-ingroup/anti-outgroup biases among extrinsically religious individuals. Implications for individual and community resilience are discussed.

Sadness predicted subject-oriented enjoyment (measured by a self-referent item: 'I enjoyed the movie') more significantly than object-oriented enjoyment (measured by an object-referent item: 'The movie entertained me'). Perceived reality fully mediated object-oriented enjoyment, but only partially mediated subject-oriented enjoyment.

848,Relational schemas and the processing of social information,"It has long been one of the grand ideas in psychology that people internalize their relationships with significant others, which influences their experience of subsequent relationships and their sense of self. Recent work in social cognition has largely neglected the impact of internally represented interpersonal information, however, with researchers choosing instead to focus on the perception of self and other persons in isolation. After a review of relevant theoretical models, it is proposed that research could profitably examine people's relational schemas, defined as cognitive structures representing regularities in patterns of interpersonal relatedness. The elements of a relational schema include an interpersonal script for the interaction pattern, a self-schema for how self is experienced in that interpersonal situation, and a schema for the other person in the interaction.

849,Obsessive-compulsive personality as a means of terror management,"This study examined obsessive-compulsive personality disorder ({OCP}) as a means of terror management. The pilot study showed that a `double-death' prime, which involved the presentation of each prime successively, was most effective at eliciting an awareness of mortality (i.e. mortality salience). The research then sought to show that those higher in {OCP} tendencies were faster to process detail information than those lower in {OCP} tendencies. Subjects (N = 138) completed a self-report measure of {OCP} tendencies and the Navon (1977) global versus local task. In contrast to previous research, the two groups (high and low {OCP} tendency) did not respond differently to global information presented with distracting local (detail) information. However, the high {OCP} tendency group had significantly faster reaction times to detail information. The research then examined whether mortality salience ({MS}) affected participants' responses to a visual scanning task. Participants were presented with a double-death {MS} prime and were then asked to complete the visual scanning task a second time as well as measures of their conscious death and annihilation anxiety. Results indicated that high {OCP} tendency participants perform faster on visual detail information processing after {MS} than without {MS} and faster than those low in {OCP} tendency. {OCP} positively correlated with death anxiety and annihilation anxiety. Performance on global information processing moderated the relationship between {OCP} and death anxiety. Implications for personality specific defenses to {MS} are discussed.

850,"Adoptees do not lack self-esteem: A meta-analysis of studies on self-esteem of transracial, international, and domestic adoptees","Do adopted children show lower self-esteem than nonadopted peers, and do transracial adoptees show lower self-esteem than same-race adoptees? Adopted children are hypothesized to be at risk of low self-esteem. They may suffer from the consequences of neglect, abuse, and malnutrition in institutions before adoption. They have to cope with their adoptive status, which often includes difficulties associated with the lack of resemblance to their adoptive parents. Additionally, transracial and international adoptees may feel less integrated into their family, resulting in low self-esteem. In a series of metaanalyses, the authors found, however, no difference in self-esteem between adoptees (N = 10,977) and nonadopted comparisons (N = 33,862) across 88 studies. This was equally true for international, domestic, and transracial adoptees. Across 18 studies including 2,198 adoptees, no differences in self-esteem were found between transracial and same-race adoptees. In contrast, in a small set of 3 studies (N = 300), adoptees showed higher levels of self-esteem than nonadopted, institutionalized children. The authors' findings may be explained by adoptees' resilience to overcome early adversity, supported by the large investment of adoptive families.

851,Self-affirmation can enable goal disengagement,"Much research has shown that after being self-affirmed, people respond to challenges in healthy, productive ways, including better task performance. The current research demonstrates that self-affirmation can also deflate motivation and performance, a pattern consistent with goal disengagement. We posited that being self-affirmed and then attempting but failing at a task would lead people to retreat from the goal. In support of this hypothesis, 4 experiments found that the combination of self-affirmation and the experience of failure led to demotivation and effort reduction. Experiment 1 found that self-affirmed participants, more so than nonaffirmed participants, reported being open to goal disengagement. Experiment 2 found that affirming core values before trying a task beset with failure reduced task motivation and performance. Experiment 3 demonstrated the robustness of the effect and found that failure on one task reduced motivation and performance on a new but related task. Experiment 4 revealed that being self-affirmed and experiencing failure caused participants to feel less capable of pursuing their goals, which produced poorer performance. These findings suggest that affirming the self can lead people to internalize the implications of failure, which in turn leads to goal disengagement.

852,Joking in the face of death: A terror management approach to humor production,"Terror management theory has spawned a body of experimental research documenting a multitude of defensive responses to mortality salience manipulations (e.g., rigid adherence to dominant cultural values, self-esteem bolstering). Another substantive body of work suggests that humor functions as a natural and often effective means of down-regulating stressful or traumatic experiences. Integrating a terror management paradigm with a cartoon captioning task, the present study finds that participants subliminally primed with death wrote funnier captions than those primed with pain, as judged by outside raters. Interestingly, a reverse pattern was obtained for participants’ own ratings of their captions; explicitly death-primed participants rated themselves more successful at generating humorous captions than their pain-primed counterparts, while no significant difference emerged between the two subliminal priming conditions. Findings contribute new insights to recent research suggesting that death reminders may sometimes facilitate creativity and open-mindedness.

853,What if they’re right about the afterlife? Evidence of the role of existential threat on anti-atheist prejudice,"Terror management theory posits that the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing terror that is assuaged by embracing cultural worldviews that provide a sense that one is a valuable participant in a meaningful universe. We propose that pervasive and pronounced anti-atheist prejudices stem, in part, from the existential threat posed by conflicting worldview beliefs. Two studies were conducted to establish that existential concerns contribute to anti-atheist sentiments. Experiment 1 found that a subtle reminder of death increased disparagement, social distancing, and distrust of atheists. Experiment 2 found that asking people to think about atheism increased the accessibility of implicit death thoughts. These studies provide the first empirical link between existential concerns and anti-atheist prejudices.

854,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for individuals whose lives have been affected by cancer: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ({MBCT}) for individuals with a diagnosis of cancer. Method: Participants (N = 115) diagnosed with cancer, across site and stage, were randomly allocated to either the treatment or the wait-list condition. Treatment was conducted at 1 site, by a single therapist, and involved participation in 8 weekly 2-hr sessions that focused on mindfulness. Participants meditated for up to 1 hr daily and attended an additional full-day session during the course. Participants were assessed before treatment and 10 weeks later; this second assessment occurred immediately after completion of the program for the treatment condition. The treatment condition was also assessed at 3 months postintervention. All postinitial assessments were completed by assessors who were blind to treatment allocation. Results: There were large and significant improvements in mindfulness (effect size [{ES}] = 0.55), depression ({ES} = 0.83), anxiety ({ES} = 0.59), and distress ({ES} = 0.53) as well as a trend for quality of life ({ES} = 0.30) for {MBCT} participants compared to those who had not received the training. The wait-list group was assessed before and after receiving the intervention and demonstrated similar change. Conclusions: These improvements represent clinically meaningful change and provide evidence for the provision of {MBCT} within oncology settings.

855,'I need you to listen to what happened to me': Personal narratives of social trauma in research and peace-building,"This article explores the uses of personal narratives of massive social trauma in conflict, most specifically as they relate to the Palestinian–Israeli context. It is asserted that there are types of narratives, fixated on persecution, hatred, and fear, that can obstruct peace, and different types that encourage peace and reconciliation. The article discusses the impacts of sharing personal narratives on the victims and others in society, the connections between personal and master narratives, and ways in which dialogue that incorporates personal narratives can encourage peace. A theoretical categorization of 4 types of personal narratives of massive social trauma is proposed: narratives of vengeance, victimhood, confusion, and embracing the other. Examples from Israelis and Palestinians that reflect this conceptualization are discussed. It is concluded that a more nuanced understanding of types of personal narratives is needed when engaged in peace-building endeavors in an ongoing conflict.

856,Defensive Zeal and the Uncertain Self: What Makes You So Sure?,"In Studies 1-3, undergraduates with high self-esteem ({HSEs}) reacted to personal uncertainty-threats with compensatory conviction about unrelated issues and aspects of the self. In Study 1 {HSEs} reacted to salience of personal dilemmas with increased implicit conviction about self-definition. In Study 2 they reacted to the same uncertainty-threat with increased explicit conviction about social issues. In Study 3, {HSEs} (particularly defensive {HSEs}, i.e., with low implicit self-esteem; C. H. Jordan, S. J. Spencer, \& M. P. Zanna, 2003) reacted to uncertainty about a personal relationship with compensatory conviction about social issues. For {HSEs} in Study 4, expressing convictions about social issues decreased subjective salience of dilemma-related uncertainties that were not related to the social issues. Compensatory conviction is viewed as a mode of repression, akin to reaction formation, that helps keep unwanted thoughts out of awareness.

857,Places and faces: Geographic environment influences the ingroup memory advantage,"The preferential allocation of attention and memory to the ingroup (the ingroup memory advantage) is one of the most replicated effects in the psychological literature. But little is known about what factors may influence such effects. Here the authors investigated a potential influence: category salience as determined by the perceiver’s geographic environment. They did so by studying the ingroup memory advantage in perceptually ambiguous groups for whom perceptual cues do not make group membership immediately salient. Individuals in an environment in which a particular group membership was salient (Mormon and non-Mormon men and women living in Salt Lake City, Utah) showed better memory for faces belonging to their ingroup in an incidental encoding paradigm. Majority group participants in an environment where this group membership was not salient (non-Mormon men and women in the northeastern United States), however, showed no ingroup memory advantage whereas minority group participants (Mormons) in the same environment did. But in the same environment, when differences in group membership were made accessible via an unobtrusive priming task, non-Mormons did show an ingroup memory advantage and Mormons’ memory for ingroup members increased. Environmental context cues therefore influence the ingroup memory advantage for categories that are not intrinsically salient.

858,Systems of pathological accommodation and change in analysis,"This paper is an attempt to investigate certain structures of subjectivity laid down in development by processes of pathological accommodation. These emerge when the child is required preemptively to adhere to the needs of its primary objects at the expense of its own psychological distinctness. By repetitive patterning of the child's first reality, an immutable product is created and emerges in the form of fixed belief systems. Systems of pathological accommodation are responses to the trauma of archaic object loss and designed to protect against intolerable pain and existential anxiety. These structures are reactivated in analysis in the context of reciprocal, mutually influencing structures operating unrecognized in both patient and analyst. When they are not addressed, they represent a formidable source of resistance to the analytic process. A review of pathological accommodation in the history of psychoanalysis itself is provided.

859,Terror management theory: Reminders of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a mortality salience prime,"According to Terror Management Theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986), when confronted with a life threat that elicits a fear of death, people react with defensive mechanisms in order to reestablish a homeostatic sense of calm. Research on the theory has shown that to manage this fear of mortality, people tend to conform to cultural standards or religious values, which can provide them a sense of immortality in a spiritual sense (for a review, see Greenberg, Solomon, \& Pyszczynski, 1997). In order to elicit a fear of death, or mortality salience prime, a standard method is typically used which includes asking participants to write about their own death. However, it has not yet been demonstrated that other measures can bring about mortality salience, or {MS}, to the same degree. Taking into regard recent real-life events, Study 1 of the present research is an attempt to investigate whether another method, such as the terrorist attacks of 9/11, can induce the same terror management mechanisms. The method used was modeled after a previous study (Greenberg, Schimel, Martens, Solomon, \& Pyszczynski, 2001) that demonstrated increased tolerance for a racist author after using the standard prime for mortality salience. The procedure employed undergraduate participants that were exposed to the standard mortality salience prime, and to readings of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Their level of tolerance for a Black and White racist author, after their mortality was made salient, was compared to a control group. Due to the demographic area in which this research was conducted, participants of various cultural backgrounds and origins were taken into consideration. The findings of the three compared groups (African Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians) resulted in no significant differences. A second study was conducted to again test the 9/11 prime, and to more closely look at cultural differences in their reactions. The participants were either, Caucasian, Puerto Rican, or Cuban-Americans living in South Florida. The method used for Study 2 was also modeled after a previous study (Jonas, Schimel, Greenberg, \& Pyszczynski, 2002), which examined effects of mortality salience on prosocial behavior. The participant's terror management mechanism of clinging to one's heritage after a mortality salience prime was tested. After the standard mortality salience prime or the 9/11 prime was employed, the participants were given the task to pick one of three charities they would choose to give a donation to. Each charity was for the victims of 9/11, and represented each of their cultures of origin. The findings of Study 2 revealed that most of the participants chose to donate to the American charity, as opposed to the Puerto Rican or Cuban charities. Although the results were again non-significant, a trend demonstrated that after the 9/11 prime, there was a slight increase in donations for the charities representing culture of origin.

The results demonstrate the multifaceted nature of self-focused attention and elucidate major controversies in the field. Overall, self-focus was associated with negative affect. Several moderators qualified this relationship. Self-focus and negative affect were more strongly related in clinical and female-dominated samples. Rumination yielded stronger effect sizes than nonruminative self-focus. Self-focus on positive self-aspects and following a positive event were related to lower negative affect. Most important, an interaction between foci of self-attention and form of negative affect was found: Private self-focus was more strongly associated with depression and generalized anxiety, whereas public self-focus was more strongly associated with social anxiety.

861,Applying goldfried’s concept of assimilative psychotherapy integration: The process of synthesizing existential and cognitive behavioral therapy models,"In the current article, the authors suggest a new avenue for therapy integration by considering an integration of Existential and Cognitive Behavioral therapies. We propose that psychotherapy itself is an existential project and that existential and cognitive–behavioral therapies share many common goals, while differing in methods. An integration of these 2 approaches would enrich the toolkit of clinical methods available to therapists and provide a theoretical framework that balances acceptance and change. Such a framework would include both broad and specific elements, and thus be a more inclusive and holistic reflection of the complex realities of clients’ lived experience. We discuss how the process of integration may begin to unfold by applying Goldfried’s model of assimilative integration to the issue at hand. To illustrate practical starting points for integration, we ground the current discussion in the context of trans-theoretical clinical issues, such as avoidance, identity diffusion and crisis, distortions in emotional and cognitive responding, and perceived meaning.

862,Is there anybody out there? Trait anthropomorphism predicts the psychological benefits of a favorite belonging,"Prior research shows that there are stable personality differences in the tendency to attribute human-like mental states to (i.e., anthropomorphize) non-human targets. A separate line of research has explored the extent to which individuals turn to non-human targets as a source of the support and security people often derive from close relationships. The current paper offers a first integration of these lines of research by testing whether trait differences in the tendency to anthropomorphize non-human targets predicts the extent to which individuals derive feelings of security from a favorite belonging. An experimental study finds that individuals who tend to anthropomorphize feel greater security after a reminder of a favorite object (vs. close other) and that these feelings of security subsequently enhance motivations for personal growth, an established benefit of interpersonal relationships.

863,Mortality salience impairs self-referential processing: Neurophysiological and behavioral evidence,"Although recent research has suggested that reminders of mortality may increase behaviors and cognitions associated with escaping the self, this notion has not been directly tested. The current work provides evidence that mortality salience ({MS}) decreases the brain activity in response to the encoding of self-referential memory (Experiment 1) and impairs subsequent retrieval of self-referential memory (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 (N = 39) used event-related potentials to examine participants’ brain response while they performed trait judgments about the self and a celebrity, after they were primed with either {MS} or death-irrelevant negative affect ({NA}). Relative to {NA}, {MS} priming significantly attenuated an early frontal positivity at 180–300 ms in response to self- vs. celebrity-referential encoding. In Experiment 2 (N = 177), {MS}- and {NA}-primed participants performed the above trait judgment tasks and then completed a recognition test for the previously presented trait adjectives. Relative to {NA} priming, {MS} priming impaired recognition of trait adjectives that were associated with the self but not the celebrity. Overall, our findings suggest impaired self-referential processing, or ‘escaping’ the self, as a coping strategy for mortality concerns.

864,"Can religious, moral, and spiritual identities moderate the deleterious effects of various social threats on social needs, cognitive and mental health outcomes? Can some identities minimize damage and/or facilitate recovery?","The purpose of the current study is to examine whether religious, moral, and/or spiritual identities moderate the effects of mortality salience on damage to social needs, moods, cognitive functioning, and other health outcomes. Furthermore, can an identity serve to build resilience or facilitate recovery from the effects of mortality salience? This study is a 4 (identity: religious / moral / spiritual / control) x 4 (social threat: mortality / dental pain / rejection / simple control) x 2 (order of priming manipulations: identity first / social threat first) between-subjects design. Religious, moral, and spiritual identities, along with the control condition, were manipulated by using a sentence scrambling technique (Shariff \& Norenzayan, 2007). Mortality salience was manipulated using the standard terror management paradigm by asking open-ended questions to think about one's own death (Greenberg et al., 1990; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, \& Breus 1994; Greenberg, Solomon, \& Arndt, 2008; Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, \& Lyon, 1989). The effects of mortality salience were expected to be most affected by religious identity, in comparison to spiritual and moral identity and the control condition, because thoughts of the afterlife may serve as to ameliorate the negative impacts of thinking of death. Two comparison conditions were included, which are a social rejection and a simple control. Social rejection was manipulated similarly to the manipulation of mortality salience, by asking participants to imagine a situation in which they were socially rejected (Craighead, Kimball, \& Rehak, 1979; Molden, Lucas, Gardner, Dean, \& Knowles, 2009; Pickett, Gardner, \& Knowles, 2004; Williams \& Fitness, 2004). The order of the identity and social threat manipulations were counterbalanced to test whether identity serves as a protective or recovery factor against the effects of mortality salience on the dependent measures. Mortality salience was most damaging to state anxiety when it was primed before identity. This result was consistent across all of the identity types. Conversely, rejection had a detrimental impact on social needs and mood when it was experienced after any of the identity manipulations. However, this negative effect on social needs and mood, were reduced when rejection was followed by religious identity arousal. Therefore, religious identity arousal served as a protective factor for social needs and mood when following rejection, but this was not true of spiritual or moral identity arousals.

Results indicated high incidence of ‘Togetherness’ and ‘Stress-related situation’ themes in the young age group, whereas ‘Symbolic’ and ‘No escape’ themes were found to be significantly low in the same age group. On an unconscious level, the young age group seems to be the most vulnerable to the stress-related situation, the old age group is the least influenced by it, and the intermediate group makes the most psychological efforts at coping with it.

867,Interpersonal politics: The role of terror management and attachment processes in shaping political preferences,"Research on terror management theory ({TMT}) indicates that reminders of death affect political attitudes, but political orientation only sometimes moderates these effects. We propose that secure relationships are associated with values of tolerance and compassion, thus orienting people toward liberalism; insecure attachments are associated with more rigid and absolutist values that orient people toward conservatism. Given that attachment relationships become especially active when security needs are heightened, we predicted that mortality salience would be an important factor in understanding the relationship between attachment processes and political orientation. Supporting these ideas, Study 1 showed that after a mortality-salience manipulation, securely attached participants increased their support for a liberal presidential candidate, and less securely attached participants increased their support for a conservative presidential candidate. In Study 2, a secure-relationship prime following a mortality-salience manipulation engendered a less violent approach to the problem of terrorism than did a neutral-relationship prime. We discuss the interaction of {TMT} processes and individual differences in attachment in shaping political preferences.

It depends on one's worldview,"The present research used validated cardiovascular measures to examine threat reactions among members of stigmatized groups when interacting with members of nonstigmatized groups who were, or were not, prejudiced against their group. The authors hypothesized that people's beliefs about the fairness of the status system would moderate their experience of threat during intergroup interactions. The authors predicted that for members of stigmatized groups who believe the status system is fair, interacting with a prejudiced partner, compared with interacting with an unprejudiced partner, would disconfirm their worldview and result in greater threat. In contrast, the authors predicted that for members of stigmatized groups who believe the system is unfair, interacting with a prejudiced partner, compared with interacting with an unprejudiced partner, would confirm their worldview and result in less threat. The authors examined these predictions among Latinas interacting with a White female confederate (Study 1) and White females interacting with a White male confederate (Study 2). As predicted, people's beliefs about the fairness of the status system moderated their experiences of threat during intergroup interactions, indicated both by cardiovascular responses and nonverbal behavior. The specific pattern of the moderation differed across the 2 studies. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Townsend, Sarah S.

869,"Symbolic hate: Intention to intimidate, political ideology, and group association","In Virginia v. Black (123 S.Ct. 1536, 2003), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did not bar statutes that prohibit cross burnings in which defendants acted with intention to intimidate others. Using a variety of symbols including cross burnings, swastikas, confederate flags, and skin fists, the current research tested how mock jurors used alternative actor intentions to judge culpability in symbolic hate speech cases. Only partially validating the Court’s assumptions, participants rated guilt certainty highest when they believed the speakers conveyed direct threats, sometimes regardless of whether defendants intended to intimidate others. Further, results showed the level of perceived intimidation only partially mediated the relationship between type of fact pattern and guilt certainty ratings. While alternative intentions did produce different levels of intention to intimidate, path analysis showed that the participants’ ratings of the defendant’s intention to convey a direct threat influenced guilt certainty ratings in all cases. Perceived intimidation levels predicted culpability in only some of the cases and not for cross burning on private property.

We carried out 5 experimental studies to investigate this notion. In Experiment 1, a primed implicit goal affected individuals' choices even when those avowedly served an explicit 'focal' goal. Experiment 2 replicated this finding with a different type of implicit goals. Experiment 3 found that primed implicit goals had no effect on choices where the options that served them undermined the explicit goal. Experiment 4 found that a primed implicit goal served by a multifinal option does not privilege it over a unifinal option if that goal had been already attained by a different means. Finally, Experiment 5, via 3 types of control groups, showed that choices were affected by both the explicit and implicit goals in isolation, and they shifted toward multifinality when these goals were conjointly present. The discussion considers the integrative potential of the multifinality framework and its implications for a variety of phenomena in the domain of motivated cognition.

The study attempted to answer the research question: What is the palliative care patient's experience of the transition from the sickness to dying? This study elicited the stories of eight home-based palliative care patients regarding their experience of this transition. All of these patients suffered from one or more chronic conditions, from which they would likely die. They were recruited from a hospice that provided pre-hospice palliative care services for those approaching death but were not yet referred to hospice by their physician. The data collection process consisted of three interviews: two interviews of five open-end questions and a verification interview. The study utilized Riessman's narrative methodology and analysis procedures, using both thematic and structural analysis. Additionally, the study employed {NVivo} 12 qualitative data analysis software in eliciting both individual case themes and study composite themes across all eight participants. One of the primary themes derived from the meta-analysis strongly suggested a new, as yet unidentified role within the medical system, not concomitant with either the sick or dying roles. This role was identified as a chronic sick role. Furthermore, the unanticipated predominant theme of the study was the deterioration of the physical body. This study confirmed the observations within the academic literature regarding the neglect of the physical or 'lived' body both in psychological and medical sociological discourse particularly in hospice and palliative care settings. Among other important insights gleaned from analysis of the narrative data was the fundamental import of death denial in its various aspects throughout this study, including participant recruitment and potential hospice gatekeeping. The Terror Management Health Model, utilized to understand the effects of mortality salience on decision making in healthcare settings, has not yet been utilized in hospice palliative care settings, where mortality salience has a major impact on both patients and clinician decision-making. This study also noted themes of depression and anxiety among participants, which indicated the potential for psychological pathology among home-based hospice palliative care patients.

874,Self-esteem buffers the mortality salience effect on the implicit self-face processing,"Previous works on the Terror management theory ({TMT}) have shown that thoughts of one’s own death provoke avoidance of the self-focused state and that self-esteem could buffer the deeply rooted anxiety and fear of death. However, surprisingly little research has examined this issue directly. In Study 1, we investigated 112 healthy adults who completed two explicit self-face processing tasks. High self-esteem group and low self-esteem group were primed to increase mortality salience ({MS}) or negative affect ({NA}). Results did not reveal a main effect or any interaction effects between self-esteem and priming on the self-face processing. In Study 2, 116 participants completed both an implicit self-face recognition task and an explicit self-face familiarity identification task. Results showed that in the implicit self-face recognition task, high self-esteem participants responded faster to the self-face than to the friend-face after the {MS} priming, while participants with low self-esteem did not show such a difference. However, results of the explicit task revealed neither a main effect of priming nor an interaction effect between self-esteem and priming. Our findings indicate that reminders of mortality decrease the reaction times to the self-face in an implicit way and this effect is moderated by people’s level of self-esteem.

875,Worldview accommodation: Selectively modifying committed beliefs provides defense against worldview threat,"Although numerous studies have examined compensatory reactions to ideological threats such as derogation, relatively little research has focused on alternative forms of defense. One such alternative, termed accommodation, involves accepting and incorporating parts of the threatening information into existing belief-structures. The present research employs a terror management framework to assess the effects of worldview threat, death-thoughts, and trait self-esteem on worldview accommodation. Five studies demonstrate that accommodation entails selectively modifying only peripheral worldview beliefs, while retaining core beliefs. Study 1 demonstrates that accommodation increases as a function of death-thought accessibility ({DTA}) aroused by threat. Studies 2–5 show that self-esteem moderates the effects of threat on accommodation, such that people with low (but not high) self-esteem accommodate their worldview. Moreover, accommodation is found to reduce source derogation (Studies 1–3), fluid defensiveness (Study 4), and {DTA} (Study 5). Discussion focuses on implications for understanding various means of coping with worldview threats.

Muslim and non-Muslim Indonesian students studying in Australia were randomized to an {MS} or control condition. Following completion of a distracter task, participants were asked to rate their agreement/disagreement with another Indonesian Muslim student’s (bogus) statements toward extremist views and violent extremist actions. After controlling for alienation, Muslim students in the {MS} condition reported significantly higher levels of support for extremist views than did non-Muslims. There was no significant effect of {MS} on violent extremist action in either Muslims or non-Muslims. The results suggest that reminders of death ({MS}) may lead young Muslims to be more supportive of politically and religiously extreme views, but not violent action. Our findings lend partial support to previous research in Iranian Muslim students; however, further research is needed to establish factors that can result in increased support for violent extremism.

877,"I sing the body problematic: Terror, trauma, and contemporary poetry","In The Denial of Death (1973), the anthropologist Ernest Becker posited that all humans harbor a repressed death anxiety called 'terror.' Terror can be made conscious by reminders of one’s biological nature (i.e., creatureliness), but humans’ unique ability to think symbolically mitigates concerns of creatureliness. Social psychologists established terror management theory ({TMT}) to empirically test Becker’s propositions, specifically how culture arises as a means to distance humans from their base animal nature and offer figurative death transcendence. Poetry, a facet of culture that relies on symbolic thinking to chart even the most aversive human experiences, offers unique grounds to examine cultural ideas and practices regarding the body and death. This paper uses {TMT} principles to examine poetry collections by three contemporary authors, while comparing and contrasting primary concepts with those found in trauma theory, a genre of criticism that focuses on subjects’ responses to and memories of imperiling external events.

878,Collective trauma from the lab to the real world: The effects of the holocaust on contemporary israeli political cognitions,"This research tested whether chronic or contextually activated Holocaust exposure is associated with more extreme political attitudes among Israeli Jews. Study 1 (N = 57), and Study 2 (N = 61) found that Holocaust primes increased support for aggressive policies against a current adversary and decreased support for political compromise via an amplified sense of identification with Zionist ideology. These effects, however, were obtained only under an exclusive but not an inclusive framing of the Holocaust. Study 3 (N = 152) replicated these findings in a field study conducted around Holocaust Remembrance Day and showed that the link between Holocaust exposure, ideological identification, and militancy also occurs in real‐life settings. Study 4 (N = 867) demonstrated in a nationally representative survey that Holocaust survivors and their descendants exhibited amplified existential threat responses to contemporary political violence, which were associated with militancy and opposition to peaceful compromises. Together, these studies illustrate the Holocaustization of Israeli political cognitions 70 years later.

879,Self-esteem and 'if…then' contingencies of interpersonal acceptance,"The degree to which an individual perceives interpersonal acceptance as being contingent on successes and failures, versus being relatively unconditional, is an important factor in the social construction of self-esteem. The authors used a lexical-decision task to examine people's 'if…then' expectancies. On each trial, participants were shown a success or failure context word and then they made word-nonword judgments on a second letter string, which sometimes was a target word relating to interpersonal outcomes. For low-self-esteem participants, success and failure contexts facilitated the processing of acceptance and rejection target words, respectively, revealing associations between performance and social outcomes. Study 2 ruled out a simple valence-congruency explanation. Study 3 demonstrated that the reaction-time pattern was stronger for people who had recently been primed with a highly contingent relationship, as opposed to one based more on unconditional acceptance. These results contribute to a social-cognitive formulation of the role of relational schemas in the social construction of self-esteem.

880,"On the perpetuation of ignorance: System dependence, system justification, and the motivated avoidance of sociopolitical information","[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 102(2) of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (see record [rid]2011-28190-001[/rid]). Due to a production error, the article was published with the images omitted from Appendix A. All versions of this article have been corrected.] How do people cope when they feel uninformed or unable to understand important social issues, such as the environment, energy concerns, or the economy? Do they seek out information, or do they simply ignore the threatening issue at hand? One would intuitively expect that a lack of knowledge would motivate an increased, unbiased search for information, thereby facilitating participation and engagement in these issues—especially when they are consequential, pressing, and self-relevant. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between the importance/self-relevance of social issues and people's willingness to engage with and learn about them. Leveraging the literature on system justification theory (Jost \& Banaji, 1994), the authors hypothesized that, rather than motivating an increased search for information, a lack of knowledge about a specific sociopolitical issue will (a) foster feelings of dependence on the government, which will (b) increase system justification and government trust, which will (c) increase desires to avoid learning about the relevant issue when information is negative or when information valence is unknown. In other words, the authors suggest that ignorance—as a function of the system justifying tendencies it may activate—may, ironically, breed more ignorance. In the contexts of energy, environmental, and economic issues, the authors present 5 studies that (a) provide evidence for this specific psychological chain (i.e., ignorance about an issue → dependence → government trust → avoidance of information about that issue); (b) shed light on the role of threat and motivation in driving the second and third links in this chain; and (c) illustrate the unfortunate consequences of this process for individual action in those contexts that may need it most.

881,Do People Need Self-Esteem? Comment on Pyszczynski et al (2004),"In spite of impressive empirical evidence consistent with aspects of terror management theory ({TMT}) reviewed by T. Pyszczynski, J. Greenberg, S. Solomon, J. Arndt, and J. Schimel (2004), several fundamental assumptions of the theory remain untested or lack support. Specifically, Pyszczynski et al. (2004) have not demonstrated that (a) people need self-esteem, (b) pursuing self-esteem is an effective means for reducing anxiety, (c) pursuing self-esteem helps people achieve their important goals, (d) having or pursuing self-esteem is the only way to deal with anxiety to achieve important goals, or (e) death is the real issue driving the pursuit of self-esteem. The authors suggest there is a different paradigm for thinking about death, one in which awareness of one's mortality serves as a precious reminder of the limited time one has to accomplish one's most important goals. All of these questions can be addressed with empirical research. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Crocker, Jennifer and Nuer, Noah",0,,881
882,"Subjective nearness-to-death, filial obligations, and depressive symptoms: The case of jews and arabs in israel","Objectives: Research has examined the link between subjective perceptions of life and death and psychological well-being. However, while cultural values were shown to provide a defense against death-related thoughts, little is known about specific cultural expectations with regard to this issue. Accordingly, the current study focused on two sub-cultures within the Israeli society, and examined whether filial obligations moderate the connection between subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms. Moreover, the study also examined whether this moderating effect is culture-dependent, by examining differences between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel.Method: Data were collected from 337 participants, two-thirds of which were Jewish. Age ranged from 45 to 65 (M = 52.32, {SD} =4.49). All participants filled out scales examining subjective nearness-to-death, filial piety, and depressive symptoms.Results: Filial piety did not moderate the connection between subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms for the entire cohort. However, a significant three-way interaction of cultural group × filial piety × subjective nearness-to-death was found, and further analyses demonstrated that filial piety served as a significant moderator among Jews, but not among Arabs.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of examining subjective perceptions of mortality in a cultural context, as culture was shown to affect how such perceptions are connected with depressive symptoms. These effects are discussed from the framework of terror management theory within the context of the Israeli society, and future directions are suggested.

883,"Top management team surface-level diversity, strategic change, and long-term firm performance: A mediated model investigation","Top management team ({TMT}) heterogeneity research has not yet clearly revealed whether surface-level diversity (i.e., national culture, gender, age) contributes to or detracts from a firm’s financial performance and has not focused on how strategic change frequency (number international diversification or refocusing activities) serves as an intervening mechanism. Based on a sample of 1,993 firms between 2003 and 2015, we examine the mediating role of strategic change frequency in the relationship between surface-level diversity and long-term firm performance. Grounded in the upper echelons perspective, we find that {TMT} surface-level diversity increases rather than decreases strategic change frequency. Furthermore, our results are consistent with our hypothesized positive relationship between strategic change frequency and long-term firm performance. More important, we also find support for a longitudinal-based mediation model in which strategic change frequency in terms of diversification/refocusing actions (Time 2) transmits the positive effect of {TMT} surface-level diversity (Time 1) to long-term financial performance (Time 3) without accounting for any moderated conditions suggesting that mediation models warrant more utilization in the upper echelons research and internationalization research domains. Implications for the upper echelons theory in a more global world as if relates to the often unexplored surface-level diversity are offered.

884,Is objectification always harmful? Reactions to objectifying images and feedback as a function of self-objectification and mortality salience,"From the perspective of terror management theory, awareness of death induces a need for validation of important values. Thus, for women who place a high value on their appearance (e.g., high self-objectifiers), mortality salience should increase positive reactions to objectifying experiences relative to women who do not highly value appearance. Two studies supported this hypothesis. Self-objectification moderated favorable reactions to objectifying stimuli (Study 1) and state self-esteem in response to an objectifying comment (Study 2) when women were primed with death. Together, the studies illustrate the complexity of reactions to objectification and, by highlighting conditions in which objectification serves a psychological function, help to explain the pervasiveness of the phenomena.

886,The role of religion in moderating the impact of life events on material life goals: Some evidence in support of terror management theory,"How would religion and a life event carrying an existential threat ({LEET}) jointly impact a person’s life goals of becoming wealthy and successful in one’s career? Goal reprioritisation, socioemotional selectivity, and gerotranscendence theories predict a shift away from material goals following a {LEET}, independent of the effect of religion. However, terror management theory ({TMT}) predicts that the effect of death thoughts depends on one’s prevailing cultural values. As religion can be regarded as a culture, it is possible that Christians’ and nonbelievers’ material life goals would be differentially altered by {LEET}. Data from 1259 young Chinese adults reveal no main effect of {LEET}, but a strong effect of religion. Moreover, there was an interaction effect between {LEET} and religion on material life goals: {LEET} weakened material goals for Christians but not for non-believers. These findings suggest that {TMT} is more suitable than the other theories for predicting life goal changes. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Hui, C.

The results of the review highlight the mixed and inconsistent findings that have been reported in the literature. While fear arousal appears important for attracting attention, its contribution to behaviour change appears less critical than other factors, such as perceptions of vulnerability and effective coping strategies. Furthermore, threatening appeals targeting young males (a high-risk group of concern) have traditionally relied on the portrayal of physical harm. However, the available evidence questions the relevance, and hence effectiveness, of strong physical threats with this group. Consequently, further research is required to determine the optimum way to utilise fear in road safety advertising, as well as the type of threat(s) most effective with different road users.

888,Motivational determinants of integrating positive and negative past identities,"Five studies examined whether quality of motivation (as individual differences and primed) facilitates or thwarts integration of positive and negative past identities. Specifically, more autonomously motivated participants felt closer to, and were more accepting of, both negative and positive past characteristics and central life events, whereas more control-motivated participants were closer to and more accepting of positive, but not negative, past characteristics and events. Notably, controlled motivation hindered participants' acceptance of their own negative identities but not of others' negative identities, suggesting that control-motivated individuals' rejection of negative past identities was an attempt to distance from undesirable parts of themselves. Defensive processes, reflected in nonpersonal pronouns and escape motives, mediated interaction effects, indicating that lower defense allowed fuller integration. Integration of both positive and negative past identities predicted indicators of well-being, namely, vitality, meaning, and relatedness satisfaction.

890,Mindful acceptance dampens neuroaffective reactions to external and rewarding performance feedback,"Previous research on mindfulness has suggested that individuals high in trait mindfulness show heightened sensitivity to visceral and internally generated stimuli. However, when mindful individuals are exposed to external stimuli—such as pictures or faces—their emotional responses are typically attenuated. In the current study, we tested how trait mindfulness relates to reactivity in response to a different type of external stimulus, namely, performance feedback. Using electroencephalography, we recorded participants’ neuroaffective reactions to rewarding, aversive, and neutral feedback, as indexed by the feedback-related negativity ({FRN}). The {FRN} is a brain response that peaks approximately 250 ms after feedback presentation, and it is thought to differentiate feedback indicating favorable versus unfavorable outcomes. Our findings suggest trait mindfulness predicts less differentiation of rewarding from neutral feedback, but does not predict brain differentiation of aversive from neutral feedback. This was the case particularly for individuals who scored highly on the 'acceptance' facet of mindfulness, a facet that assesses the nonjudgmental acceptance of thoughts and emotions. We discuss the implications of these findings for current theory on mindfulness and emotion regulation.

891,Sticky prospects: Loss frames are cognitively stickier than gain frames,"Research across numerous domains has highlighted the current—and presumably temporary—effects of frames on preference and behavior. Yet people often encounter information that has been framed in different ways across contexts, and there are reasons to predict that certain frames, once encountered, might tend to stick in the mind and resist subsequent reframing. We propose that loss frames are stickier than gain frames in their ability to shape people’s thinking. Specifically, we suggest that the effect of a loss frame may linger longer than that of a gain frame in the face of reframing and that this asymmetry may arise because it is more difficult to convert a loss-framed concept into a gain-framed concept than vice versa. Supporting this notion, loss-to-gain (vs. gain-to-loss) reframing had a muted impact on both risk preferences (Study 1) and evaluation (Study 2). Moreover, participants took longer to solve a math problem that required reconceptualizing losses as gains than vice versa (Studies 3–5), and reframing changed gain-based conceptualizations but not loss-based ones (Study 6). We discuss implications for understanding a key process underlying negativity bias, as well as how sequential frames might impact political behavior and economic recovery.

892,A March to a better world? Religiosity and the existential function of belief in social-moral progress,"This article reports an investigation of the existential function of belief in progress, specifically faith in social and moral advancement. We argue that for belief in progress to provide a sense of purpose and significance in our world, it must concern humanity and society and not merely the technological advances humankind accomplishes. We observed an effect of mortality salience on belief in social-moral (but not scientific-technological) progress, which was moderated by strength of religious belief. Participants low in religious belief showed an increase in belief in social-moral progress, while those high in religious belief did not. Follow-up analyses revealed that the latter finding was primarily due to Protestant participants, who scored highest on strength of religious faith and belief in inherent sin, and were the least optimistic about the future of humanity.

893,"Sacred armor: Religion's role as a buffer against the anxieties of life and the fear of death - {APA} handbook of psychology, religion, and spirituality (Vol 1): Context, theory, and research.","Given religion’s central significance, we begin with a basic question: What psychological functions does religion serve for people? Classic and contemporary scholars in philosophy, psychology, and the social sciences have proposed a number of factors that may contribute to the psychological appeal and value of religion. Amid this diversity of viewpoints, we can identify a recurring theme that forms the central thesis of this chapter: A primary function of religiousness is to buffer the individual against anxiety. In elaborating on this claim, we first discuss how classic theorists such as William James (1902) and Sigmund Freud (1913/1919, 1927/1961) each, in his own way, highlighted religion’s anxiety-buffering function. We then present a brief overview of perspectives that focuses on how adherence to religious ideologies may buffer anxiety by providing people with attachment, structure, and hope, particularly when people have doubts about having the internal or external resources to obtain desired outcomes and avoid undesired ones. Next we focus on a core source of anxiety—the awareness that the self will inevitably die—and provide an account of religion’s anxiety-buffering function derived from terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, \& Pyszczynski, 2004). According to this theory, people manage the potential anxiety stemming from their awareness of mortality by subscribing to cultural worldviews, which afford opportunities to view life as valuable and continuing on in some way after death. From this perspective, religiousness serves to buffer anxiety about mortality by offering opportunities to attain immortality, thereby making death less threatening. We buttress our theoretical analysis with historical, correlational, and experimental evidence for the role of terror management processes in motivating adherence to religion. Also, we review research showing that motivated adherence to religion shapes people’s attitudes and behaviors regarding a range of domains, including intergroup relations and medical decision making. In these ways, we show that {TMT} provides a unique and empirically substantiated account of religion’s significance in human affairs that can be used to organize diverse evidence regarding religion’s social and personal import.

894,Family metaphors and moral intuitions: How conservatives and liberals narrate their lives,"This research examines life-narrative interviews obtained from 128 highly religious and politically active adults to test differences between political conservatives and liberals on (a) implicit family metaphors (G. Lakoff, 2002) and (b) moral intuitions (J. Haidt \& C. Joseph, 2004). Content analysis of 12 key scenes in life stories showed that conservatives, as predicted, tended to depict authority figures as strict enforcers of moral rules and to identify lessons in self-discipline. By contrast, liberals were more likely to identify lessons learned regarding empathy and openness, even though (contrary to prediction) they were no more likely than conservatives to describe nurturant authority figures. Analysis of extended discourse on the development of religious faith and personal morality showed that conservatives emphasized moral intuitions regarding respect for social hierarchy, allegiance to in-groups, and the purity or sanctity of the self, whereas liberals invested more significance in moral intuitions regarding harm and fairness. The results are discussed in terms of the recent upsurge of interest among psychologists in political ideology and the value of using life-narrative methods and concepts to explore how politically active adults attempt to construct meaningful lives.

The initial study, conducted during the 6-month anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks (9/11), discovered that a diverse group of Americans preferred assimilation as a foreign policy and multiculturalism as a domestic policy. After reading that foreigners were supporting the dominant global status of the United States, however, Americans in Experiment 2 no longer expressed this preference for assimilation as a model for foreign intergroup relations. Experiment 3 discovered that Americans primed with 9/11 (i.e., a foreign threat) revealed higher levels of national identity than did those primed with the Columbine massacre (i.e., a domestic threat); moreover, level of national identity predicted support for multiculturalism as a domestic policy and assimilation as a foreign policy.

897,The Israeli-Palestinian peace process and its vicissitudes: Insights from attitude theory,"The vicissitudes of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process since 1967 are analyzed using attitudes and related concepts where relevant. The 1967 war returned the two peoples' zero-sum conflict around national identity to its origin as a conflict within the land both peoples claim. Gradually, new attitudes evolved regarding the necessity and possibility of negotiations toward a two-state solution based on mutual recognition, which became the building stones of the 1993 Oslo agreement. Lacking a commitment to a final outcome, the Oslo-based peace process was hampered by reserve options, which increased avoidance at the expense of approach tendencies as the parties moved toward a final agreement. The resulting breakdown of the process in 2000 produced clashing narratives, reflecting different anchors for judgment and classical mirror images. Public support for violence increased, even as public opinion continued to favor a negotiated two-state solution. Reviving the peace process requires mutual reassurance about the availability of a partner for negotiating a principled peace based on a historic compromise that meets the basic needs and validates the identities of both peoples.

Firm support for any proposed theory, however, has been limited by the difficulties inherent in inducing jealousy and examining any proposed mediating mechanisms in real time. In support of a theory of jealousy centering on threats to the self-system, 2 experiments are presented that address these past limitations and argue for a model based on context-induced variability in self-evaluation. Experiment 1 presents a method for evoking jealousy through the use of highly orchestrated social encounters and demonstrates that threatened self-esteem functions as a principal mediator of jealousy. In addition to replicating these findings, Experiment 2 provides direct evidence for jealousy as a cause of aggression. The ability of the proposed theory of jealousy to integrate other extant findings in the literature is also discussed.

903,Treating objects like women: The impact of terror management and objectification on the perception of women’s faces,"There is a modern trend whereby women’s beauty and attractiveness tends towards the artificial, which appears to be an extreme manifestation of objectification culture. Research suggests that sexual objectification has the ability to alter the way we perceive women. Objectification occurs, in part, because women’s bodies pose a unique existential threat, and objectifying women is believed to mitigate concerns about mortality because it transforms women into something inanimate and thus less mortal. We therefore hypothesized that priming death concerns should impact object-person recognition of women. In the present study we recruited 177 undergraduate students from a U.S. Midwestern university to participate in exchange for course credit. We utilized face-morphing techniques to create a series of images representing a continuum of artificial-to-real faces, and after being exposed to a death reminder (as opposed to a pain reminder comparison condition), we asked participants to rate the extent to which the image appeared artificial. Results suggested that death awareness biases people towards reporting artificial female (but not male) faces as real. Existential concerns about death have an impact on perceptual assessments of women, specifically women who have been turned into literal objects. Future research directions, limitations of the current study, and implications for improving women’s health and well-being with this added knowledge about objectification are discussed.

Building on this past research, the current research examined how an important source of meaning, long‐term goal progress, affects the ways that death‐relevant cognitions impact judgments of life's meaning. In Study 1 (N = 118), mortality salience decreased perceptions of meaning in life only among participants who were induced to feel closer to (vs. farther from) completing a long‐term goal. Study 2 (N = 259) extended these findings by demonstrating the moderating influence of individual differences in locomotion. Mortality salience again decreased perceptions of meaning in life among participants who felt closer to accomplishing a long‐term goal, but it only did so among people who do not quickly adopt new goals to pursue (i.e., those low in locomotion). The implications of these findings for better understanding how people maintain meaning in the face of existential concerns and how aspects of goal pursuit affect these processes are discussed.

905,Clash of civilizations? Terror Management Theory and the role of the ontological representations of death in contemporary global crisis,"According to the Terror Management Theory ({TMT}: Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986), the psychological conflict resulting from humans’ having a desire to live, but realizing that death is inevitable, gives rise to potentially debilitating existential terror that is managed by embracing cultural belief systems and adhering to the standards of value associated with them. The present article considers one psychosocial effect of this dissonance: the contemporary discord between Western and Middle- Eastern cultures. The role of religion and secularism in contemporary intercultural hostilities, which characterizes the contemporary global crisis, is investigated, starting from a consideration of the role of ontological representations of death in the construction of cultural worldviews that provide a sense of meaning and value and afford opportunities to obtain literal and symbolic immortality.

906,The challenges of reintegration for service members and their families,"The ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have posed a number of reintegration challenges to service members. Much of the research focuses on those service members experiencing psychological problems and being treated at the {VA}. In this article, we contend that much of the distress service members experience occurs following deployment and is a consequence of the difficulties encountered during their efforts to successfully reintegrate into their families and communities. We propose a new conceptual framework for intervening in this reintegration distress that is psycho‐educational in nature as well as a new delivery model for providing such services. An example of this new intervention framework is presented. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Danish, Steven J. and Antonides, Bradley J.",0,,905
907,Exploring the reproduction of conflict through narrative: Israeli youth motivated to participate in a coexistence program,"Contemporary Israeli youth are socialized in the context of intractable nationalist conflict with Palestinians, characterized by a 'master' historical narrative of Jewish Israeli identity that exacerbates the conflict. This exploratory study examines the relation between this master narrative and the personal narratives of youth motivated to participate in a coexistence program. Narratives of youth suggest points of both convergence and divergence with the master narrative in their form, thematic content, and ideological settings. Like the larger story of Jewish Israeli identity, the stories of youth assumed a redemptive form and integrated themes of existential insecurity, historical persecution, exceptionalism, and delegitimization of Palestinian identity. Divergence with the master narrative suggested the significance of local communities and the growing pluralism of Israeli society, as well as policy shifts in Israel regarding the legitimacy of Palestinian statehood. Despite motivation to participate in a coexistence program, youth narratives tended to reproduce the narrative conditions of conflict. Implications for peace-building efforts with Jewish Israeli youth are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Hammack, Phillip L.",0,,906
908,"Shifting away from a monolithic narrative on conflict: Israelis, Palestinians, and Americans in conversation","Clashing narratives and power asymmetry can serve as obstacles to promoting reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. In this study, we examine transcripts from a contact encounter among Israeli, Palestinian, and American adolescents. The first aim of this study was to identify the basic root narratives articulated by the Israeli and Palestinian participants in conversation. The second aim was to test conversational conditions associated with moments of perspective taking. Our analysis of two separate dialogue groups indicated that the Jewish participants tended to articulate a root narrative in which the Jews have good intentions to live in peace but must defend themselves. Palestinian participants tended to invoke a narrative in which they own the land but have been dispossessed and humiliated due to Jewish occupation. A comparison of different dialogue sessions indicated that when the conversation focused on the present as opposed to the past and when there was active involvement of an American third party, there were more moments in which members of each group acknowledged the narrative of the other. Our findings highlight the importance of third party involvement and concentrating discussion on the present to create more instances in which individuals can incorporate the other into their accounts of the conflict.

909,Theoretical innovations in social and personality psychology and implications for health: Introduction to special issue,"The goal of this special issue was to highlight major areas of innovation in recent social/personality psychology that hold promise for synergistic integration with health psychology and related fields in the pursuit of adequate health promotion, health care, and population health. The desired outcome is to excite interest and new ways of thinking that, in turn, spawn programs of research poised to advance both theory and practice. Each of the articles reinforces a culture of science in which psychologists of all stripes (social, personality, health, clinical, and others) can work collaboratively to develop stronger models and testable hypotheses with clear applications to enduring health problems. Undergirding this ethos is the observation that much work in the health arena is carried out by multidisciplinary research teams, buttressed by concomitant evidence that 'team science' can produce superior outcomes (Hall et al., 2012).

Here, the authors integrate these literatures and test bivariate relationships between state affect (e.g., moods), trait affect (e.g., affectivity), and organizational justice variables using meta-analytically aggregated effect sizes. Results indicated that state and trait positive and negative affect exhibit statistically significant relationships with perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice in the predicted directions, with mean population-level correlations ranging in absolute magnitude from Mρ̂ = .09 to Mρ̂ = .43. Correlations involving state affect generally were larger but not significantly different from those involving trait affect. Finally, the authors propose ideas for investigations at the primary-study level. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Barsky, Adam and Kaplan, Seth A.",0,,909
911,Together in pain: Attachment-related dyadic processes and posttraumatic stress disorder,"We used actor–partner interdependence modeling to explore associations among attachment-related dyadic processes, posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) in war veterans, and secondary traumatic stress ({STS}) in their wives. A sample of 157 Israeli couples (85 former prisoners of war and their wives and a comparison group of 72 veterans not held captive and their wives) completed self-report scales assessing attachment insecurities (anxiety, avoidance) and {PTSD} symptoms. For both groups of veterans and their wives, attachment anxiety was associated with the severity of their own and their spouses' {PTSD} and {STS}. Avoidant attachment was associated with {PTSD} and {STS} only in couples that included a former prisoner of war. A complex pattern of associations involving avoidant attachment was observed in the actor–partner analyses of these couples. The study demonstrates that attachment-related dyadic processes play a role in the development and maintenance of {PTSD} in traumatized veterans and {STS} in their wives.

912,Conservative ideological shift among adolescents in response to system threat,"We examined conservative ideological shift among adolescents by assessing the effect of different types of threat on the self-reported political orientation of 183 New York City high school students and investigated the mediating role of system justification. Participants read one of three newspaper passages: (1) a system-related passage that described flaws in the American social, economic, and political system; (2) a self-related passage that described the deleterious health effects of cell phone use; or (3) a control passage that described house plant cultivation. Participants then completed measures of system justification and political orientation. As hypothesized, a threat to the system (but not the self) increased self-reported conservatism indirectly through its effect on system justification. This suggests that when the overarching social system is threatened, adolescents may be drawn to conservative ideology and that this is attributable, at least in part, to a heightened desire to defend and bolster the societal status quo.

913,Self-compassion as a buffer against concrete but not abstract threat,"Terror management theory posits that validation of self-esteem is a major defense mechanism in keeping mortal concerns at bay. Yet, self-esteem often leads to devaluation of others. Self-compassion ({SC}) is an alternative, more inclusive construct than self-esteem. We explored among 125 university students whether {SC} serves as a defense mechanism from abstract and concrete threats responses, utilizing a dot-probe task and mortality salience priming. Although {SC} was not associated with avoidance of abstract threats, it was associated with avoidance of concrete threats. These findings underscore the potential role of {SC} in coping with trauma and in shielding from developing post-traumatic symptoms.

914,Terror management theory: A theory of psychological well-being - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) has illustrated that the awareness of death is a motivational force underlying several social phenomena. As such, the theory is largely, and perhaps primarily, considered to be a core social psychological theory. However, {TMT}, in its scientific breadth, is also a theory about psychological well-being. It outlines conditions necessary for the maintenance of psychological well-being and it explicates why these conditions are necessary. This chapter discusses {TMT}'s claims about well-being, highlights emerging research testing these claims, and integrates this within the broader terror management literature. More specifically, it presents {TMT} as a theory about psychological well-being. The chapter details research investigating whether the awareness of death causes anxiety and compromises well-being when adequate anxiety buffers are not in place. It considers the nuances of these effects, discussing how conscious and unconscious activation of death thoughts bring about such aversive psychological consequences. Lastly, the chapter considers how the negative affective states that the awareness of death arouses may relate to the strategies that people use to manage both conscious and unconscious activation of death thoughts.

915,From terror to transcendence: Death reflection promotes preferences for human drama,"Previous studies that examined the impact of death awareness on entertainment gratifications have used mortality salience. The present study introduces a more personal form of mortality priming called death reflection, which simulates near-death experiences. Compared to mortality salience, death reflection is a competing manipulation that has been found to promote positive outcomes, including improved self-perceptions, rather than worldview defense and self-esteem motives. A between-subjects online experiment (N = 108) was designed to test the main effects of two different death primes on emotional valence and arousal, meaningful affect, and genre preferences for sad drama and comedy. Results show that death reflection was distinct from mortality salience in its capacity to produce greater arousal and interest in watching sad drama. Furthermore, mediation analyses using structural equation modeling show indirect effects of death reflection on interest in sad drama through emotional intensity and self-perceptual depth as mediators. Death reflection as a mortality reminder is arguably more compatible with a key function of somber entertainment, including dramas and tragedies, which is to facilitate human insights and personal growth.

916,A Motivated Action Theory Account of Goal Orientation,"Rapid organizational change is increasing the pressure on employees to continually update their skills and adapt their behavior to new organizational realities. Goal orientation is a promising motivational construct that may explain why some individuals adapt to change better. Unfortunately, the current goal orientation literature is in a state of conceptual and methodological disarray. This presentation reviews the goal orientation literature and identifies numerous conceptual ambiguities, including definitional inconsistencies, dimensional inconsistencies, and inconsistencies in the conceptualization of stability. These conceptual ambiguities result in a confusing array of goal orientation measures and manipulations and ultimately an incoherent empirical database. A dynamic self-regulation model of goal orientation, termed motivated action theory, is presented to integrate the various conceptual perspectives and to provide guidelines for future goal orientation research.

Whether a construct comes to the fore in a perceiver's mind depends on the extent to which the construct is highly accessible (because of recent exposure). In a series of cognitive priming experiments, the authors simulated the experience of bicultural individuals (people who have internalized two cultures) of switching between different cultural frames in response to culturally laden symbols. The authors discuss how this dynamic, constructivist approach illuminates (1) when cultural constructs are potent drivers of behavior and (2) how bicultural individuals may control the cognitive effects of culture.

918,Why Do So Many Latina Teens Attempt Suicide? A Conceptual Model for Research,"Rates of suicide attempts among adolescent Latinas have been reported to be higher than for their non-Hispanic counterparts. Yet researchers know very little about the attempts, their antecedents, and why the girls attempt suicide. Latina girls have been included in research on suicidal adolescents and typically show higher rates of attempts relative to similar psychopathology when compared with other young women. A few small studies have focused on Latinas, but none have explored why suicide attempt rates are higher. The authors constructed a conceptual model to provide a formulation of this phenomenon on the basis of a review of the literature on suicide attempts among Latinas and their clinical experience. This model can serve as a framework to guide research on the unique sociocultural processes present in Latina adolescent suicide attempts and may also benefit the work of clinicians.

919,The magic that binds us: Magical thinking and inclusive fitness,"Magical thinking has often been viewed as a cognitive mistake rooted in a poor understanding of causality, which can be fixed with education and experience. However, an alternative interpretation is that magical thinking may be highly adaptive in specific situations. This article attempts a theoretical argument that although magical thinking may be illogical, it does provide survival benefits, specifically the modification of anxiety. Based on the previous assumption there would exist an asymmetric survival cost between magical and logical thinking for situations dealing with unmanageable threats. Given that unmanageable threats cause anxiety, and are unlikely to be influenced by human action, and anxiety has a negative influence on an individual’s health, memory, and task performance, we can conclude magical thinking could be viewed as something more than a cognitive mistake. Instead magical thinking should be viewed as an adaptive and functional cognitive tool which is an evolutionary by-product or adaptation.

920,"Integrating terror management, group threat, relational and cultural perspectives on out- group bias: A motivational hierarchical model of immigrant sentiment","A humanitarian crisis in immigrant detention and treatment of refugees has been partially created and maintained with the use of immigrant threat narratives in the United States since September 11, 2001. Despite evidence to the contrary, the narrative typically focuses on economic, violent crime and terrorism threats to justify exclusionary immigration policies. The current research represents a cross-sectional study surveying 1,005 U.S. residents seeking to test, contrast and integrate 3 dominant models of anti-immigrant sentiment ({AIS}). The models include the Group Threat, Cultural and Contact models and includes analyses of terror management mechanisms inspired by the ongoing war on terror's relationship with cultural factors. The study utilized linear regression and correlational analysis testing each model's ability to predict {AIS}, argues that they represent different levels of analysis and tests interactions of the varying models to construct a more comprehensive approach to {AIS}. Findings indicate that Group Threat factors' impact is subjective rather than evidence based and predict personality and political traits associated with {AIS}. On its own, the Cultural model is the strongest predictor of {AIS}, but interact with Group Threat factors by mediating their impact on {AIS}. Further, having positive interactions with immigrants was found to moderate the combined effect of Group Threat and Cultural factors lessening their impact on {AIS}. The findings inform intervention efforts meant to combat the immigrant threat narrative fueling the humanitarian crisis and more evidenced based approaches to immigration policy interventions.

922,Proximal and distal terror management defenses: A systematic review and analysis - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Decades of research on the dual-process terror management system ({TMT}) have revealed a complex series of processes by which humans protect themselves from the haunting awareness of mortality. Myriad mental gymnastics keep death-related anxiety stowed away in dark recesses of the unconscious, allowing people to go about their day-to-day lives seemingly untouched by ever-lingering thoughts of their demise. Death-related concerns persist beneath the surface of focal awareness, playing a central role in the processes by which individuals regulate their behavior. This chapter presents an empirically driven account of the psychological mechanisms that keep death-related thoughts hidden behind the veil of human consciousness. Research on this subject originally built upon two prominent psychological movements. The chapter outlines the varied components of existential-psychodynamic model, with a brief overview of its basic elements. It summarizes and analyzes a plethora of studies illustrating proximal and distal responses to mortality, identifying fruitful directions for future research along the way. The chapter asserts that {TMT} experiments typically occur over brief time periods. Yet, the results may indicate how the processes in question play out across broader timescales. Residual terror then gets processed as mere subconscious flicker—one that is extinguished through heroic-yet-defensive strivings for symbolic meaning and value.

923,Thoughts on the inner conflict within Islamic culture: Their existential anxieties and ours,"This paper focuses on how Islamic terrorism is primarily part of a larger internal conflict within Islamic culture. Western, liberal (largely Christian) democracies evolved over centuries of their own bloody philosophical and political struggles between religious authority and what came to be defined as a modern, civil society built on individual freedom of belief, secular authority, and law. Now, Western liberal modernity represents a deep existential threat to traditional Islamic societies around gender, family relations, and individual beliefs. A ferocious internal struggle exists between those Muslims who believe Islam can absorb those tensions—Creating its own version of an open, tolerant, cultural modernity—Versus political Islamists, jihadists, for whom the annihilation anxiety elicited by the threatened social change is directed both internally and in violent rage at the West.

924,Mother Teresa Versus Ebenezer Scrooge: Mortality Salience Leads Proselfs to Endorse Self-Transcendent Values (Unless Proselfs Are Reassured),"Recently, Jonas, Schimel, Greenberg, and Pyszczynski demonstrated that mortality salience ({MS}) increased contributions to (an ingroup) charity (i.e., the Scrooge effect). The authors examined whether individual differences in social value orientations would moderate the Scrooge effect. In line with an Ebenezer shift hypothesis, proselfs were less likely than prosocials to endorse self-transcendent values in a dental pain control condition but were indistinguishable from prosocials in an {MS} condition as proselfs increased endorsement of self-transcendent values under {MS} (Experiments 1 and 2a). However, when participants gave their impressions of an unfavorable prosocial or a favorable proself prior to the {MS} manipulation, proselfs were again less likely than prosocials to endorse self-transcendent values (Experiments 2a and 2b), suggesting that proselfs are unlikely to transform into prosocials under conditions of {MS} when given reasons to disidentify with prosocial values or identify with proself values.

In Experiments 1-3, participants who envisioned their lives and imagined themselves engaging in a task 1 year later as opposed to the next day subsequently performed better on a series of insight tasks. In Experiments 4 and 5 a distal perspective was found to improve creative generation of abstract solutions. Moreover, Experiment 5 demonstrated a similar effect with temporal distance manipulated indirectly, by making participants imagine their lives in general a year from now versus tomorrow prior to performance.

926,Self‐protective altruism,"Prosocial behavior accentuates the tension between two conflicting human motivations, self-interest and belongingness. Responding to the needs of others may compromise self-interest. Acting callously, however, may lead to social disproval. These antagonistic responses are existentially meaningful as belongingness and self-esteem have been found to regulate death anxiety. In this paper I critically examine three possible hypotheses concerning the tension between egotism and prosociality from a terror management perspective. The first hypothesis, the carpe diem hypothesis, suggests that when death is salient egotistic self-interest overrides other-oriented responses. The second hypothesis, the norm salience hypothesis, suggests that when death is salient people will respond according to the momentarily accessible social norm. The third hypothesis, the self-protective altruism hypothesis, argues that when the prosocial cause reminds people of their fragile, mortal nature people will turn away from helping when death is salient, but when the prosocial cause is benign death salience will increase prosocial responding.

927,The roles of self-esteem and attachment within the framework of terror management theory,"Built upon the idea that human beings, as the only species whose members are aware of their own consciousness and future death, have to come up with a system to deal with this awareness, terror management theory aims to shed light on the mechanisms that human beings have developed in order to avoid the cold fact of death. According to terror management theory, culture serves as an anxiety buffer against death by offering either a literal or symbolic immortality. The sense of protection and safety provided by the parental care in childhood is sought in the worldview in adulthood. At this point, self-esteem comes into the equation; individuals with high self-esteem experience more sense of compliance with their worldview than those with low self-esteem, and they feel less anxiety when their mortality is reminded to them. Recent research links these with attachment styles. In this study, it is aimed to review the ideas presented here and developed within the framework of terror management theory, and to discuss the benefits that can be drawn from their findings, especially in regards to clinical applications.

I also measured two potential moderators of the proposed effects: attachment styles and workaholism. I hypothesized that death-related thoughts would increase participants' ratings of work and relationship importance, dependent on participants' awareness of work-family conflict, workaholism, and attachment styles. In an online experiment, 296 participants were randomly assigned to imagine either death or a painful dental procedure and to imagine either a form of work-family conflict or boring job tasks. Participants then completed parallel measures of work importance and relationship importance. Unexpectedly, participants' ratings of work importance and relationship importance remained consistent across experimental conditions and regardless of workaholism and attachment styles.

Using a sample of 420 Israeli students, Study 1 revealed an inverse correlation between self-reports of symbolic immortality and fear of personal death. This finding was validated in Study 2 (N = 120), which found that high symbolic immortality reduced the effects of a death salience manipulation on the level of punishment given to a social transgressor. Study 3 (N = 270) refined the association between symbolic immortality and fear of death. The inverse correlation found in Study 1 was revealed only among securely attached persons. The discussion emphasizes the interconnectedness between personality, symbolic immortality, and the management of the terror of death.

Using a newly devised method for testing multiple mediator models, two studies were conducted to examine the hypothesis that religious people’s forgiveness values mediate the relationship between religiosity and forgiveness forecasts, independent of self-perceived past forgiveness tendencies. The first study focused on predicted forgiveness of hypothetical offenders, and the second examined forecasted forgiveness of those responsible for the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. In both studies, the mediating role of forgiveness values (independent of past forgiveness tendencies) was established, suggesting a value-congruent bias in religious people’s forgiveness forecasts.

932,On the Subjective Quality of Social Justice: The Role of Affect as Information in the Psychology of Justice Judgments,"This article argues that it is not uncommon for people forming justice judgments to lack information that is most relevant in the particular situation. In information-uncertain conditions, people may therefore construct justice judgments by relying on how they feel about the events they have encountered, and justice judgments may hence be strongly influenced by affect information. Findings show that in information-uncertain conditions, the affective states that people had been in prior and unrelated to the justice event indeed strongly influenced their justice judgments. These findings thus reveal that in situations of information uncertainty, people's judgments of justice can be very subjective, susceptible to affective states that have no logical relationship with the justice judgments they are constructing. Implications for the social psychology of justice and the literature on social cognition and affect are discussed.

Observations of wailing events and interviews with Yemenite-Jewish wailers and mourners in Israel were analyzed to understand respondents’ perceptions of the experience of wailing as well as the anxiety-oriented psychotherapeutic expertise involved. The findings are discussed to propose an alternative outlook on the intersubjective adaptive value of death anxiety.

934,Loving freedom: Concerns with promotion or prevention and the role of autonomy in relationship well-being,"Close relationships fulfill many important needs. However, not all of these needs are equally salient under all circumstances. This article investigated how the broad motivational context in which people evaluate relationships affects the salience of particular needs, thereby altering how the fulfillment of these needs predicts relationship well-being. Across 5 studies, participants reported how well their current romantic relationship met their needs for self-direction and autonomy, either by providing support for the fulfillment of these needs (Studies 1–3) or by allowing them to feel that they autonomously choose to remain in the relationship (Studies 4 and 5). In motivational contexts emphasizing personal growth and advancement (promotion), one’s own independent priorities could become more salient, increasing the relevance of autonomy experiences when evaluating relationship well-being. However, in motivational contexts emphasizing safety and security (prevention), autonomy experiences might not be especially salient and thus might not have any special relevance when evaluating relationship well-being. Both measurements and manipulations of participants’ motivations for growth or security consistently supported these hypotheses.

936,"The implication of combat-induced stress reaction, {PTSD}, and attachment in parenting among war veterans","This study examined parental functioning, parental satisfaction, and concern for offspring during their child's military service, among war veterans, some of whom suffered from acute combat-induced stress reaction ({CSR}) and posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). In addition, we examined the additive and interactive contributions of {CSR}, {PTSD} and attachment dimensions to parenting measures. The sample consisted of 477 participants divided into two groups: a clinical group of veterans who had been diagnosed with {CSR} on the battlefield (N = 267), and a matched control group of veterans who did not suffer from {CSR} ({NCSR}; N = 210). {CSR}, {PTSD}, avoidant-attachment, and anxious-attachment, were all related to lower levels of parental functioning and satisfaction. Veterans who suffered from both {CSR} and {PTSD} reported more concern for their offspring during their child's military service compared to veterans with {PTSD} but without antecedent {CSR}. Attachment dimensions and specifically attachment-avoidance, made the greatest contribution to parenting measures, followed by posttraumatic symptoms. In addition, attachment-avoidance moderated the relationship between posttraumatic symptoms and parental functioning. Theoretical and clinical implications of these results are discussed.

937,"Mortality salience, religiosity, and indefinite life extension: Evidence of a reciprocal relationship between afterlife beliefs and support for forestalling death","Strides are being made in medicine toward the possibility of indefinite life extension ({ILE}). Research shows that people cope with the prospect of mortality with various ways to feel transcendent of death, including investing in religion and afterlife beliefs. But how would these investments be affected by the possibility of {ILE} through medical science? The current research provides an initial effort to answer this question by testing whether, after mortality has been made salient, portraying indefinite life extension as plausible might reduce investment in afterlife beliefs. Results showed that for participants low in religiosity, mortality salience, or an essay supporting the plausibility of {ILE}, decreased belief in the afterlife and increased support for {ILE}. Furthermore, among participants low in religiosity, the increase in support for {ILE} was mediated by decreased afterlife belief. These findings provide the first evidence of the psychological impact of the prospect of indefinite life extension.

939,"Implicit self-esteem: Nature, measurement, and a new way forward","Gaining insight into the nature and consequences of people's global self-evaluations (i.e., their self-esteem) has been fraught with difficulty. Nearly 2 decades ago, researchers suggested that such difficulties might be addressed by the development of a new class of measures designed to uncover implicit self-esteem. In this article, we evaluate the construct validity of the 2 most common measures of implicit self-esteem, the Implicit Association Test ({IAT}) and Name–Letter Test ({NLT}). Our review indicates that the research literature has not provided strong or consistent support for the validity of either measure. We conclude that both tests are impoverished measures of self-esteem that are better understood as measures of either generalized implicit affect ({IAT}) or implicit egotism ({NLT}). However, we suggest that there surely are aspects of self-esteem that people are unwilling or unable to report and suggest a general approach that may allow researchers to tap these unspoken aspects of self-esteem.

940,Coping and film reception: A study on the impact of film dramas and the mediating effects of emotional modes of film reception and coping strategies,"This study investigated the impact of film dramas on the emotional and cognitive state of recipients, as well as mediating effects of different modes of film reception. Furthermore, associations between the modes of reception and individual favored coping strategies were examined. One hundred fifty nondepressive and nonsuicidal adults living in Austria watched one of three films featuring the death of the main character. Data on the viewers’ mood, inner tensions, self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression, suicidal tendencies, attitudes toward suicide, predominantly used modes of reception, and preferred coping strategies were collected with questionnaires that were handed out before and after seeing the movie. Results indicated that drama viewing was linked to both negative and positive effects: on the one hand, to a deterioration of mood as well as an increase of inner tensions and depression scores, and on the other hand, to a rise in self-esteem and life satisfaction as well as a drop in suicidal tendencies. The more a subject was involved in the film, the more pronounced were the negative impacts and the smaller were the positive reactions. The viewers’ preferred coping strategies were partly associated with the modes of reception: the more an individual preferred to seek social support when facing a problem, the more he or she identified with the drama’s protagonist and tried to find behavior patterns in the movie to improve his or her own life.

Numerical status and group growth or decline were manipulated between subjects. Growth was manipulated orthogonally to a 3rd variable: focus. Focus was manipulated by describing growth information with respect either to the in-group or the out-group (e.g., in-group growth and out-group decline). A Numerical Status × Focus interaction emerged in Study 1. Numerical minority members' consensus estimates for an opinion issue increased when growth information was out-group focused, whereas majority members' estimates did not differ as a function of the focus variable. Study 2 replicated these effects across other opinion dimensions. Study 3 confirmed the importance of the growth and focus variables in the absence of numerical status manipulations.

942,Person × Situation interactionism in self-encoding (Iam…when…): Implications for affect regulation and social information processing,"Although Person × Situation (P × S) interactionism is central in current social-cognitive conceptions of personality organization, its implications for the encoding of the self remain unexplored. Two studies examined the causal role of P × S interactionism in self-encoding on affect regulation and discriminative social perception. Following failure (Studies 1 and 2) and success (Study 2) ideation, participants were prompted to encode the self either in P × S interactionist terms (I am…when…) or in traitlike unconditional terms (I am…). Interactionist (compared with unconditional) self-encoding led to less affective extremity, suggesting that such encoding may prevent individuals from generalizing specific success and failure experiences to the self as a whole. Study 2 also found that interactionist self-encoding attenuated the endorsement of global stereotypes, suggesting that such encoding may enhance fine-grained social perception as well.

Using the theoretical frameworks of the terror management health model ({TMHM}) and the health belief model ({HBM}), the study predicted the effects of parasocial interaction, such that a higher level of parasocial interaction ({PSI}) the viewer experienced before exposure to the stimuli would lead to increased emotional response, attention and physiological arousal. Among other findings, participants with higher {PSI} for a beauty blogger had greater reported positive emotional response toward blog posts than those with lower {PSI}. Additionally, those with higher {PSI} reported the greatest self-reported positive emotion toward product, news, and video posts (control condition in this study), suggesting that a higher level of {PSI} led individuals to be more engaged with self-goals (vs. health-goals) within the {TMHM}. {HBM} variables (i.e., susceptibility, severity, barriers, and benefits) were also found to predict participants' {PSI} response, emotional response, physiological arousal, and attention.

944,"Does peace have a prayer? The effect of mortality salience, compassionate values, and religious fundamentalism on hostility toward out-groups","Religious fundamentalism has been shown to be associated with higher levels of prejudice, ethnocentrism, and militarism, in spite of the compassionate values promoted by the religious faiths that most fundamentalists believe in. Based on terror management theory, we hypothesized that priming these compassionate values would encourage a shift toward less support for violent solutions to the current Middle Eastern conflict, especially when they are combined with reminders of one’s mortality. Study 1 demonstrated that among Americans, religious fundamentalism was associated with greater support for extreme military interventions, except when participants were reminded of their mortality and primed with compassionate religious values. The combination of mortality salience and compassionate religious values led to significant decreases in support for such interventions among high but not low fundamentalists. Study 2 replicated this finding and showed that it depends on the association of the compassionate values with an authoritative religious source; presentation of these values in a secular context had no effect on fundamentalists. Study 3 replicated these effects in a sample of Iranian Shiite Muslims: although a reminder of death increased anti-Western attitudes among participants primed with secular compassionate values, it decreased anti-Western attitudes among those primed with compassionate values from the Koran.

945,The impact of mortality awareness on meaning in life among Christians and atheists,"Research derived from terror management theory suggests that reliance on a terror-managing set of beliefs when reminded of death can influence one’s perception of meaning in life. The present research builds on prior work suggesting that religious concepts help to manage the awareness of death, and expands on that work to explore the challenges of religious and atheistic terror management. It was hypothesized that religious participants would be able to sustain perceived meaning in life when reminded of death, but that atheists would be vulnerable to a reduction in meaning when reminded of death. To test that idea, Christians and atheists were first reminded of either mortality or a control topic, and then asked to rate how strongly they felt life was meaningful. Results indicated that ratings of meaning in life were lower in the mortality salience condition, relative to the control condition, among the atheists but not among the Christians. Implications regarding religious and non-religious terror management strategies are discussed.

946,Terror management theory: The influence of terrorism salience on anxiety and the buffering of cultural worldview and self-esteem,"Terror management theory has previously explored the buffering of self-esteem and United States cultural worldview upon anxiety and mortality salience. However, the combination of the United Kingdom cultural worldview and terrorism salience, as a construct of mortality salience, has not been examined. The aim of this study was to establish whether the reminder of terrorism (i.e., terrorism salience) could replace the reminder of mortality (i.e., mortality salience) as an experimental reminder of our own deaths. Results revealed that terrorism salience did not produce more anxiety than the other two primed conditions. Self-esteem did not buffer significantly against the anxiety produced by terrorism and mortality conditions. Participants with high self-esteem in the terrorism salience condition were more likely to show an increased worldview defence compared to those with moderate or low self-esteem. This research provides insight into the area of terror management, looking at the influence of terrorism salience and mortality salience. The results showed that, unlike previous studies, a mortality salience manipulation established through a terrorism reminder did not effectively produce anxiety. Despite considerable support for the mortality salience hypothesis, findings show that high self-esteem does not buffer against anxiety or increase worldview defence.

This paper considers Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), one of the notable theories that have not been considered so far in persuasive technology, and aims at exploring its use in {VR} experiences. First, we show that a {VR} experience can be used to effectively elicit mortality salience ({MS}), which makes {TMT} applicable. Then, we evaluate the effects of the {VR} experience on attitudes towards risk. Wearing a head-mounted display ({HMD}), participants explored one of two virtual environments ({VEs}). In a first group of participants, the {VE} represented a cemetery with {MS} cues like tombs and burial recesses. In a second group of participants, the {MS} cues were removed, and the {VE} looked like a public park. Results show that the {MS} cues manipulation changed the effects of the {VR} experience on users’ attitudes towards risk, as {TMT} would predict. Moreover, results revealed a relationship between {MS} elicited through {VR} and physiological correlates of arousal. Finally, we show that user's personality traits can moderate the effects of the {VR} experience on attitudes towards risk.

948,Trait self-enhancement as a buffer against potentially traumatic events: A prospective study,"Longitudinal research has associated the disposition toward self-enhancing biases with better adjustment following potentially traumatic events ({PTEs}). However, self-enhancement was always measured in these studies after the {PTE}, thus confounding it with exposure. This study used a prospective design that tracked {PTEs} in college students over a 4-year period using an online checklist (n = 69). Most participants experienced at least 1 {PTE}, and the mean number of {PTEs} was 4.40. Trait self-enhancement, measured at the beginning of the study and prior to the {PTEs}, was associated with reduced distress in both the first and fourth year of college. Participants with greater exposure to {PTEs} had greater distress in their fourth year; however, individuals high in self-enhancement were relatively unaffected by {PTE} exposure. High self-enhancement participants were also rated as better copers in anonymous ratings obtained from participants' close friends. Overall, these results offer the first prospective evidence demonstrating that self-enhancement serves as a buffer against the potentially harmful effects of trauma.

949,Did human reality denial breach the evolutionary psychological barrier of mortality salience? A theory that can explain unusual features of the origin and fate of our species - Evolutionary perspectives on death.,"Some aspects of human cognition and behavior appear unusual or exaggerated relative to those of other intelligent, warm-blooded, long-lived social species—including certain mammals (cetaceans, elephants, and great apes) and birds (corvids and passerines). One collection of such related features is our remarkable ability for ignoring or denying reality in the face of clear facts, a high capacity for self-deception and false beliefs, overarching optimism bias, and irrational risk taking behavior (herein collectively called 'reality denial'). Such traits should be maladaptive for reproductive success when they first appear as consistent features in individuals of any species. This chapter discusses that reality denial is vital to understand how humans view their own mortality. It argues that the human ability for reality denial may have emerged at a similar time as the ability to understand the mental states of others (i.e., theory of mind). The chapter also argues that these two seemingly disparate cognitive abilities may have jointly shaped the evolution of our species. Furthermore, it discusses that reality denial is a fundamental aspect of human psychology that may helps to understand how individuals are able to go about their daily lives despite knowing that they are inevitably going to die.

950,Playing the objectification game: How women's self-esteem impacts the existential consequences of objectification,"Living in a culture of objectification harms women's well-being in a number of ways. Despite this well-studied phenomenon, no research has yet investigated whether objectification impacts women's existential well-being, or meaning in life, which is a critical component of psychological and physical health. Using a terror management theoretical perspective, I propose that objectification is a worldview women are encouraged to participate in in order to achieve meaning. More specifically, I propose that objectification's effect on meaning will be dependent on women's perceived success at living up to the standards of objectification (i.e. her self-esteem about her appearance), or how much she values the objectification worldview (i.e. how much important she places on her appearance). Results support that body esteem and appearance contingency of self-worth both play a role in moderating various outcomes after women have contemplated an experience of being objectified. Additional results support that an unrelated contingency of self-worth related to religion and spirituality may also moderate the impact of objectification. The importance of these results in the landscape of objectification intervention research is discussed.

951,Testing the causal relationship between religious belief and death anxiety,"Religion has long been speculated to function as a strategy to ameliorate our fear of death. Terror management theory provides two possible causal pathways through which religious beliefs can fulfil this function. According to the 'worldview defence' account of terror management, worldviews reduce death anxiety by offering symbolic immortality: on this view, only people who accept the religious worldview in question should benefit from religious beliefs. Alternatively, religious worldviews also offer literal immortality, and may do so independently of individuals’ worldviews. Both strands of thought appear in the terror management theory literature. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this issue experimentally by manipulating religious belief and measuring explicit (Study 1) and implicit (Study 2) death anxiety. In Study 1, we found that the effect of religious belief on explicit death anxiety depends critically on participants’ own religious worldviews, such that believers and non-believers reported greater death anxiety when their worldview is threatened. In Study 2, however, we find that religious belief alleviates implicit death anxiety amongst both believers and non-believers. These findings suggest that religious beliefs can alleviate death anxiety at two different levels, by offering symbolic and literal immortality, respectively.

953,Secular cultural worldviews - Handbook of terror management theory.,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) is derived from cultural anthropologist E. Becker's (1971) and (see records [rid]1976-00780-000[/rid] and [rid]1977-22425-000[/rid]) efforts to elucidate the motivational underpinnings of human behavior. The theory postulates that the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing existential terror that is managed by subscribing to cultural worldviews that afford a sense that one is a valuable participant in a meaningful universe in pursuit of literal and/or symbolic immortality. For most of human history, and to this day, people managed existential terror primarily by adhering to religious worldviews that provide explicit pathways to transcend death via literal immortality in the form of the heavens, reincarnations, resurrections, afterlives, and souls. By forging psychological ties to people, places, and times beyond their own, individuals derive symbolic immortality from perceiving themselves as noteworthy participants in an ongoing historical process that overcomes the limitations of their personal finitude. This chapter provides an overview of prominent secular worldviews along with research demonstrating that they, similar to religious worldviews, serve a terror management function.

955,Mortality salience reduces the discrimination between in‐group and out‐group interactions: A functional mri investigation using multi‐voxel pattern analysis,"As a fundamental concern of human beings, mortality salience impacts various human social behaviors including intergroup interactions; however, the underlying neural signature remains obscure. Here, we examined the neural signatures underlying the impact of mortality reminders on in‐group bias in costly punishment combining a second‐party punishment task with multivariate pattern analysis of {fMRI} data. After mortality salience ({MS}) priming or general negative affect priming, participants received offers from racial in‐group and out‐group proposers and decided how to punish proposers by reducing their payoffs. We revealed that {MS} priming attenuated in‐group bias and dampened the discriminated activation patterns pertaining to group identities in regions previously implicated in costly punishment, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporo‐parietal junction, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The group identity represented in multivariate patterns of activity of these regions predicted in‐group bias for the control condition, i.e., the stronger discriminative representations of group identities in these regions; the larger was the in‐group bias. Furthermore, the in‐group bias was reliably decoded by distributed activation patterns in the punishment‐related networks but only in the control condition and not in the {MS} condition. These findings elucidate the neural underpinnings of the effects of mortality reminders on intergroup interaction.

Using the Adult Attachment Interview ({AAI}), they compared attachment-related experiences and representations in a group of 30 Catholic priests and religious with a matched group of lay Catholics and with the worldwide normal distribution of {AAI} classifications. They found an overrepresentation of secure-autonomous states regarding attachment among those more likely to experience a principal attachment to God (i.e., the priests and religious) compared with the other groups and an underrepresentation of unresolved?disorganized states in the two groups of Catholics compared with the worldwide normal distribution. Key findings also included links between secure-autonomous states regarding attachment and estimated experiences with loving or nonrejecting parents on the one hand and loving God imagery on the other. These results extend the literature on religion from an attachment perspective and support the idea that generalized working models derived from attachment experiences with parents are reflected in believers' perceptions of God.

The aim of the current paper is to propose another buffer against mortality salience, namely spiritual transcendence. In the first study, we studied the impact of activation of spiritual transcendence as a moderator of mortality salience. Activating spiritual transcendence reduced the effect of the increase of the level of altruistic tendencies after exposure to mortality salience. In the second study, we replicated this finding based on the research procedures of former {TMT} research, using essay attacking participants’ worldview. Results showed that spiritual transcendence acts as a buffer against mortality salience both among religious and non-religious individuals. Therefore, spiritual transcendence seems to be an additional buffer against mortality salience, independent from worldview and self-esteem, and it could be further examined from {TMT} perspective.

959,Till death do us part: The effect of mortality salience on satisfaction in long-term romantic relationships,"In the 21st century, dissatisfaction in long-term, romantic relationships is prevalent. Consequently, researchers have explored various interventions that help partners preserve and nourish romance in relationships over time. However, few studies to date have directly investigated the potential that death awareness has to increase romantic satisfaction. The current study was the first to examine the effect of mortality salience ({MS}) primes not only on commitment and intimacy, but also on passion in a sample of individuals who had been in a relationship for two or more years. Additionally, this research was the first to compare the differences between the effects of an {MS}-self and an {MS}-other prime on one's experience of romantic love. It was further predicted that attachment style and baseline relationship quality would moderate the effect of the {MS} primes on romantic satisfaction. Participants ( N = 176) were recruited online using Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: {MS}-self prime ( n = 59), {MS}-other prime (n = 59), and the control condition (n = 58). Results indicated that the {MS}-self prime, but not the {MS}-other prime, predicted an increase in intimacy in long-term, romantic relationships. However, neither of the {MS} primes predicted an increase in commitment or passion, nor did the {MS} primes differ in their effect on relationship satisfaction. Lastly, attachment style and baseline relationship quality did not significantly moderate the effect of the {MS} primes on romantic satisfaction. Overall, the results from this study suggested that death awareness plays a key role in the maintenance of intimacy in long-term relationships. Further empirical investigation into this phenomenon may shed light on existential treatment options for couples having difficulty sustaining relationships in the modern age.

962,"Dissociation, perceptual processing, and conceptual processing in survivors of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake","Exposure to overwhelming events can result in difficulties cognitively processing the experience, which may be a precursor to posttraumatic stress symptoms. Trauma-induced dissociation has been proposed to be a mechanism related to these cognitive processing difficulties. Most research on information processing and dissociation has used controlled analogue trauma or has not focused on information processing and dissociation or has measured these constructs shortly after (analogue) trauma. Over the course of 20 months this study examined the relationship between different markers of dissociation, information processing, and posttraumatic stress symptoms in 20 individuals directly exposed to the fatal 6.3 magnitude Christchurch earthquake (February 22, 2011). Along with narrative assessment of experiences at the time of the earthquake, participants were given the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale ({PDS}; Foa, 1995), Dissociative Experiences Scale ({DES}; Carlson \& Putnam, 1993), and the State Dissociation Questionnaire ({SDQ}; Murray, Ehlers, \& Mayou, 2002) at different time intervals. An increase in perceptual processing of the earthquake experience was not associated with increased dissociation. However, perceptual processing approximately 6 months after the earthquake and trait dissociation 18 months after the earthquake were associated with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) symptoms. The findings suggest that trauma-related difficulties should be addressed as early as possible to resolve factors associated with more chronic problems.

963,Do women’s mate preferences change across the ovulatory cycle? A meta-analytic review,"Scientific interest in whether women experience changes across the ovulatory cycle in mating-related motivations, preferences, cognitions, and behaviors has surged in the past 2 decades. A prominent hypothesis in this area, the ovulatory shift hypothesis, posits that women experience elevated immediate sexual attraction on high- relative to low-fertility days of the cycle to men with characteristics that reflected genetic quality ancestrally. Dozens of published studies have aimed to test this hypothesis, with some reporting null effects. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate support for the pattern of cycle shifts predicted by the ovulatory shift hypothesis in a total sample of 134 effects from 38 published and 12 unpublished studies. Consistent with the hypothesis, analyses revealed robust cycle shifts that were specific to women’s preferences for hypothesized cues of (ancestral) genetic quality (96 effects in 50 studies). Cycle shifts were present when women evaluated men’s 'short-term' attractiveness and absent when women evaluated men’s 'long-term' attractiveness. More focused analyses identified specific characteristics for which cycle shifts were or were not robust and revealed areas in need of more research. Finally, we used several methods to assess potential bias due to an underrepresentation of small effects in the meta-analysis sample or to 'researcher degrees of freedom' in definitions of high- and low-fertility cycle phases. Neither type of bias appeared to account for the observed cycle shifts. The existence of robust relationship context-dependent cycle shifts in women’s mate preferences has implications for understanding the role of evolved psychological mechanisms and the ovulatory cycle in women’s attractions and social behavior.

964,Concerns about one’s aging: The role of work context and psychological distress,"Does working with frail and cognitively impaired older people, in addition to and in combination with psychological distress, lead to concerns about one’s own aging? We investigated whether aging anxiety ({AA}) and dementia worry ({DW}) systematically differed between N = 34 geriatric nurses and a comparison sample of N = 34 childcare workers. The samples did not differ with regards to sociodemographic characteristics, personality, life satisfaction, or dementia knowledge. A multivariate {GLM} analysis revealed a substantial effect of both work context (high vs. low exposure to aging/dementia; η² = .12) and overall psychological distress (η² = .15) across three indicators of {AA}/{DW}. Interindividual differences in {AA} and {DW} seem to be partially explained by professional experience in eldercare as well as by mental health resources.

Often, these experiences are described negatively and are associated with at least some form of loss. These negative experiences affect individuals' personal and existential meaning in a profound way. In this article, these experiences will be explored. Specifically, the relationship between these 2 experiences will be explored in order to understand how individuals attempt to make meaning. Finally, the application of the Relational/Cultural Model of counseling will be introduced as a way to facilitate meaning making.

966,The multifinality constraints effect: How goal multiplicity narrows the means set to a focal end,"In the presence of several objectives, goal conflict may be avoided via multifinal means, which advance all of the active goals at once. Because such means observe multiple constraints, they are fewer in number than the unconstrained means to a single goal. Five experimental studies investigated the process of choosing or generating such means for multiple goals. We found that the simultaneous activation of multiple goals restricted the set of acceptable means to ones that benefitted (or at least, did not harm) the entire set of active goals. Two moderators of this phenomenon were identified: (a) the feasibility of identifying multifinal means, which was dependent on the relations between the different active goals, and (b) the enhanced importance of the focal goal, which resulted in the inhibition of its alternatives and the consequent relaxation of multifinality constraints.

967,Exploring killer ads: A terror management account of death in advertisements,"Building on terror management theory, three experiments tested whether advertisements with a mortality reminder increase purchase intentions for products that provide an (un)important source of self‐esteem. Study 1 tested the effects of mortality salience in advertisements (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) for art library and newspaper subscriptions. Study 2 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) × 2 (brand familiarity: low vs. high) between subjects design for newspaper subscriptions. Study 3 used a 2 (mortality reminder: yes vs. no) × 2 (product type: healthy vs. unhealthy) between subjects design for a beverage with importance of the product for consumers’ self‐esteem as a continuous moderator. Main dependent measures were mood; death‐related thoughts; attitudes toward the ad; and purchase intentions. Across studies advertisements with a death reminder increased unconscious thoughts about death (Experiments 1–3), which, in turn, increased purchase intentions (Experiments 2 and 3). These effects occurred independent of mood, brand familiarity, product type, product relevance to self‐esteem, and ad liking. Findings suggest that 'killer ads' trigger unconscious consumer fears that may be alleviated by the urge to buy.

968,Selective exposure and information quantity: How different information quantities moderate decision makers' preference for consistent and inconsistent information,"Empirical evidence on selective exposure to information after decisions is contradictory: Whereas many studies have found a preference for information that is consistent with one's prior decision, some have found a preference for inconsistent information. The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

969,Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others,"The authors argue that self-image maintenance processes play an important role in stereotyping and prejudice. Three studies demonstrated that when individuals evaluated a member of a stereotyped group, they were less likely to evaluate that person negatively if their self-images had been bolstered through a self-affirmation procedure, and they were more likely to evaluate that person stereotypically if their self-images had been threatened by negative feedback. Moreover, among those individuals whose self-image had been threatened, derogating a stereotyped target mediated an increase in their self-esteem. The authors suggest that stereotyping and prejudice may be a common means to maintain one's self-image, and they discuss the role of self-image-maintenance processes in the context of motivational, sociocultural, and cognitive approaches to stereotyping and prejudice.

970,The functional domain specificity of self-esteem and the differential prediction of aggression,"On the basis of an evolutionary theory of self-esteem ({SE}), it was hypothesized that the {SE}-aggression relationship differs across functionally distinct domains of {SE} and across contexts. In 2 experiments, participants had the opportunity to aggress against the evaluator of an essay they had written. In Study 1, self-perceived superiority was positively related to aggression, whereas social inclusion was inversely related to aggression. In Study 2, in which the context was altered to simulate a mating competition, only a measure of self-perceived mate value emerged as a (positive) predictor of aggression. Global {SE} failed to contribute to the prediction of aggression in either experiment. Statistically controlling for narcissism did not eliminate either set of findings. Implications for the conceptualization and measurement of {SE} and narcissism are discussed.

We hypothesized that when people who have been encouraged to engage in pro-environmental behavior are threatened, they fall back into their (bad) habits instead of exhibiting behavioral change; existential threats may thereby counteract pro-environmental norms. We tested this hypothesis in two field studies in which participants were encouraged to reduce paper use. Although the requests initially resulted in decreased paper use, this pro-environmental behavior ceased when an existential threat was induced. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for social psychology theorizing and behavioral change.

For example, advocates of gun control have believed that the tragic cases of mass shooting would be an effective persuasive tool to draw favorable public opinion about gun control policies. However, this assumption does not meet reality. Despite a rash of mass shootings over the past 2 decades, public support for gun regulation has continued to decline. To resolve this dilemma, this article conducted 3 experiments and provided compelling explanations of how threatening shooting stories generated the unintended effects. In line with the terror management theory, the moderated mediation model showed that shooting stories produced partisan polarization on gun policies. Theoretical and practical implications of fear-inducing messages are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Jang, S. Mo",0,,971
973,"Life is short, stay awake: Death anxiety and bedtime procrastination","In the present study, the relation between bedtime procrastination and death anxiety, and also the moderator roles of gender and purpose in life were investigated. Data were collected from 245 participants through an online survey. The results revealed that gender, but not purpose in life, moderated the relation between death anxiety and bedtime procrastination. The effect of death anxiety on bedtime procrastination was significant only for males. Further, this effect was still significant even after controlling circadian energy and self-control. The findings can be explained based on the Terror Management Theory. Bedtime procrastination can be considered risk-taking behavior, and it functions as a world view for males. Moreover, males might have regarded sleep as a waste of time, and therefore, delayed bedtime to increase their non-sleeping lifetime.

974,Mortality salience enhances racial in-group bias in empathic neural responses to others' suffering,"Behavioral research suggests that mortality salience ({MS}) leads to increased in-group identification and in-group favoritism in prosocial behavior. What remains unknown is whether and how {MS} influences brain activity that mediates emotional resonance with in-group and out-group members and is associated with in-group favoritism in helping behavior. The current work investigated {MS} effects on empathic neural responses to racial in-group and out-group members' suffering. Experiments 1 and 2 respectively recorded event related potentials ({ERPs}) and blood oxygen level dependent signals to pain/neutral expressions of Asian and Caucasian faces from Chinese adults who had been primed with {MS} or negative affect ({NA}). Experiment 1 found that an early frontal/central activity (P2) was more strongly modulated by pain vs. neutral expressions of Asian than Caucasian faces, but this effect was not affected by {MS} vs. {NA} priming. However, {MS} relative to {NA} priming enhanced racial in-group bias in long-latency neural response to pain expressions over the central/parietal regions (P3). Experiment 2 found that {MS} vs. {NA} priming increased racial in-group bias in empathic neural responses to pain expression in the anterior and mid-cingulate cortex. Our findings indicate that reminding mortality enhances brain activity that differentiates between racial in-group and out-group members' emotional states and suggest a neural basis of in-group favoritism under mortality threat.

This comparison revealed that all mothers described the same coping mechanisms and perceived themselves as coping well with the threat of terror. However, with regard to {PTG}, only those who were exposed to rocket attacks for a long duration disclosed a manifest potential for {PTG} both in relation to self and in relation to others. Concurrently, because of the parental decision to live in an area exposed to missile attacks, the mothers expressed guilt feelings toward their children, fearing for their mental well-being.

977,When finding a mate feels urgent: Why relationship contingency predicts men's and women's body shame,"Given the central role of romantic relationships in the lives of men and women and the many benefits of having romantic relationships, some people may derive their self-worth from having a romantic partner (i.e., relationship contingency; Sanchez \& Kwang, 2007). Moreover, relationship success may be viewed as somehow related to being beautiful and attractive. Under structural equation modeling, results suggested that both men and women's relationship contingency (N = 329) was connected to body shame, mediated by greater urgency about finding mates. In addition, greater body shame was connected to concern over romantic partners' physical appearance. The findings are discussed considering contingencies of self-worth, rising appearance concerns for both men and women, and the perceived connection between relationship status and physical attractiveness.

The current investigation conceptualizes sanctification of forgiveness as imbuing forgiveness with sacred meaning. In Study 1 (N = 425), we developed a scale to measure to sanctification of forgiveness, and we provided evidence for construct validity. Exploratory factor analyses revealed three subscales, and these were confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. In Study 2 (N = 123), we employed a longitudinal design to measure how sanctifying forgiveness predicted changes in forgiveness over time. Across six time points, sanctification positively predicted forgiveness, even when controlling for religiousness/spirituality. Implications for religion/spirituality, forgiveness, and the measurement of these constructs are discussed.

979,Influence of distributed reporting of terror violence on implicit associations of individuals,"Following the 9/11 terror attacks, many Americans experienced some form of habit or mood-altering stress though, most had received their impressions of the violence via distributed media reporting rather than firsthand exposure. Researchers have found that the propagating effects of media broadcasting can exasperate the effects of terror. However, little is known of how reports of terror violence affect group dynamics in geographically distant nations. The purpose of this study, following terror management theory, was to understand if terrorist violence influences cognitive and implicit racial evaluations in a culturally similar, but geographically distant, population. The study's design was a quantitative natural experiment. Time of completing the assessment, either before or after the 2015 Paris Bataclan terror attack, comprised the 2-level independent variable; the dependent variables were the Race Implicit Association Test ({IAT}) and a cognitive evaluation of racial anxiety. Age and religiosity served as covariates. The target population included White citizen residents of the United States over the age of 18; 263 participants were derived from archival data. Comparisons of raw {IAT} scores showed an 8\% increase in negative implicit racial evaluations following the attack; however, the {MANCOVA} failed to achieve multivariate significance (p {\textgreater} .05). Despite the lack of statistical significance, important details on implicit racial attitudes were uncovered. Results of this study have the potential to foster positive social change by informing individuals on how their implicit associations might be affected following exposure to reports of terrorist violence. Additionally, these findings may guide national security and intelligence professional's development of post-attack response measures and task forces.

980,"The function of spirituality, social interest, life satisfaction, and materialism in moderating death anxiety in college students","This study examined the role four values/life attitudes—life satisfaction, social interest, materialism, and spirituality—in moderating death anxiety in young adult college students. The study drew from the works of Ernest Becker and from Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), which have posited that the awareness of death is ever-present; in order to manage the dread that accompanies this awareness, people seek to bolster self-esteem and adhere to culturally sanctioned values. While {TMT} focuses on unconscious processes related to death anxiety, the present study looked at the conscious fear of death to explore variables that may relate to and modify death anxiety. A convenience sample of 37 young adults aged 18 to 25 (M = 20.05, {SD} = 1.88) from a variety of colleges and universities in the Midwestern United States were given a questionnaire packets containing a demographic survey, the Satisfaction with Life Scale ({SWLS}), Social Orientation Index-Short Form ({SOI}-{SF}), Material Values Scale ({MVS}), Spiritual Perspective Scale ({SPS}), and Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale ({MFODS}). Pearson correlations were calculated in order to assess the relationships between the four values/life attitudes and death attitudes. Multiple regression analysis using a backwards elimination model was conducted to determine the summative and distinct impact of the values/life attitudes on overall death anxiety. It was hypothesized that life satisfaction would have the strongest inverse relationship to the fear of death, followed by spirituality, social interest, and then materialism. It was also hypothesized that all four values/life attitudes would have a significant influence on lower levels of death anxiety. Overall, findings did not support the hypotheses. None of the variables were related to overall death anxiety. Spirituality was significantly related to less fear of the unknown aspects of what will occur after death and social interest was related to greater fear of the death of significant others.

981,"Beauty, sex, and death: The role of mortality salience in objectification processes","Although much attention has been paid to the consequences of objectification, relatively little research has focused on the question of why women are objectified. From a terror management theory perspective, the association of women with (literal) objects strips them of the qualities that are threatening (on account of mortality concerns). Sexualization, however, underscores women's animal nature, and this association is problematic in the management of existential anxiety. The current research builds on a distinction between sexual and appearance-focused objectification to identify the existential mechanisms in the motivation to dehumanize, and subsequently harm, women. Consistent with the hypothesis, participants primed with mortality salience ({MS}) reported increased mechanistic dehumanization of a female target conforming to the operationalization of appearance-focused objectification, compared to those not primed with {MS}. Contrary to the hypothesis, {MS} did not increase animalistic dehumanization of a sexually objectified female target (Study 1). In Study 2, participants believed they were interacting with another person online; {MS} was expected to increase aggression when the partner was sexualized, and decrease aggression when she was depicted with a focus on appearance. The results did not support this hypothesis; none of the manipulations impacted aggression towards the partner. Ancillary analyses revealed that participants primed with {MS} attributed fewer human nature traits to the partner in the appearance-focused objectification condition (i.e., they mechanistically dehumanized her), compared to those not primed with {MS}, thus mirroring the effect found in Study 1. This research provides further insight into the division between sexual and appearance-focused objectification, and is suggestive of a possible existential mechanism in these processes.

982,Parenthood as a terror management mechanism: The moderating role of attachment orientations,"Six studies examined the hypothesis that parenthood serves a terror management function, with effects that are moderated by attachment orientations. In Studies 1 and 2, mortality salience, as compared with control conditions, increased the self-reported vividness and implicit accessibility of parenthood-related cognitions. In Studies 3 and 4, activating parenthood-related thoughts reduced death-thought accessibility and romantic intimacy following mortality salience. In Study 5, heightening the salience of parenthood-related obstacles increased death-thought accessibility. Across the five studies, the effects were significant mainly among participants who scored relatively low on avoidant attachment. In Study 6, avoidant people also reacted to mortality salience with more positive parenthood-related cognitions following an experimental manipulation that made parenthood compatible with their core strivings. Overall, the findings suggest that parenthood can have an anxiety-buffering effect that is moderated by attachment-related avoidance.

Related to the notion of ecological correlations, {PCs} arise when the assessment of contingencies at the individual level is affected by the base-rate relations at the group level. Positive {PCs} arise when base rates of 2 variables are skewed in the same direction (e.g., high ability and high motivation), whereas negative {PCs} arise when base rates are skewed in opposite directions. Experiment 1 demonstrates that {PCs} between student ability and motivation are contingent on effective base-rate assessment at the group level, with a bias toward positive {PCs} reflecting prior expectancies. Ruling out prior expectancies, Experiment 2 yields symmetric positive and negative {PCs}. Experiment 3 provides evidence for {PC} effects on gender stereotypes.

It was hypothesized that this should strengthen the effects of interactional and procedural justice perceptions on antisocial work behaviors. As predicted, the negative relationship between employee perceptions of interactional justice and supervisory ratings of antisocial work behaviors was stronger for people who are high as compared with low in social comparison orientation.

Studies have shown that older and younger adults differ in how they respond to reminders of their mortality. The present study investigated one hypothesized explanation for these findings: Age-related differences in the tendency to make correspondent inferences. The correspondence bias was assessed in younger and older samples after death-related, negative, or neutral primes. Younger adults displayed increased correspondent inferences following mortality primes, whereas older adults’ inferences were not affected by the reminder of death. As in prior research, age differences were evident in control conditions; however, age differences were eliminated in the death condition. Results support the existence of age-related differences in responses to mortality, with only younger adults displaying increased reliance on simplistic information structuring after a death reminder.

987,Vulnerability factors for bipolar disorders as predictors of attributions in ability-based and chance-based tests,"The role of attributional style in bipolar disorder has received empirical support. Research suggests that a pattern of global, stable, and possibly internal attributions for positive events might even trigger mania. We tested whether hypothesized risk factors for bipolar disorder are associated with such attributions after feedback of success in an ability- and chance-based test. University students (n = 115) completed the Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Activation Scales ({BIS}/{BAS}) and the Hypomanic Personality Scale ({HPS}) to assess risk for bipolar disorder. In addition, participants were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview. All participants performed an ability-based (intelligence) test and a chance-based (dice-throwing) test, and success was induced by providing positive feedback regardless of their actual test performance. Attributions of perceived success were assessed after each test. Results showed that high scores on the {BAS} scale were generally predictive of self-serving attributions in the ability-based test, while scores on the {HPS} predicted a more global and self-serving attributional style in the chance-based test. Current depression, lifetime affective disorder, {BIS}, or the dysregulation of the {BAS} did not consistently predict attributions on either test. Despite some methodological limitations, results suggest that anticipated or experienced success in skill-related contexts triggers self-serving attributions in individuals scoring high on the {BAS} scale, while perceived positive outcome in chance-related, more unrealistic contexts triggers similar attributions in individuals scoring high on the {HPS}. Future research has to examine whether these overly positive attributions after positive, chance-related situations are a stable characteristic with respect to vulnerability to mania.

Results revealed that {MS} increased support of violence under escalating conditions and low perceived vulnerability. However, for persons with direct war exposure, {MS} induced support of violence contingent on adversary rhetoric. Thus, direct experience with war leads to a more nuanced contingent response to existential threat not present among those without direct war experience.

990,An examination of defensive accommodation to threat: Exploring the conditions under which people will modify their protective beliefs,"Although terror management research has focused extensively on defensive responses to threat such as derogation, scant research to date has assessed alternative responses. One such alternative, termed accommodation, involves accepting and incorporating parts of the threatening information into existing belief-structures. The present research assessed the effects of threat, mortality salience, and trait self-esteem on accommodation of protective beliefs. Five studies are presented showing that people will generally accommodate their worldview (Studies 1-4) and self-esteem (Study 5) beliefs in response to threat. Moreover, accommodation is found to result from the same conditions that promote derogation (Study 4), and engaging in one type of defense was found to generally reduce the tendency to engage in another (Studies 2-5). In response to worldview threat under conditions of mortality salience, only participants with low self-esteem tended to respond with accommodation. Participants with high self-esteem, by contrast, refused to accommodate (Studies 1-3) and opted instead to derogate the source of threat (Studies 2-3). Inducing people with low self-esteem to affirm an important value prior to the mortality salience manipulation produced a similar tendency to forgo accommodation in favour of derogation (Study 3). Discussion focuses on implications for terror management theory generally, with specific reference to available responses to worldview and selfesteem threat, and the role of trait self-esteem in these responses.

991,Death thoughts mediate ostracism mood reduction: The moderating role of marital status,"Ostracism is known to cause psychological distress; however, it remains unclear why ostracism evokes this response. Two experiments tested empirically whether fear of death mediates ostracism distress (mood) and whether marital status moderates this role. A total of 345 participants played Cyberball with two other ostensible players. After the game, accessibility of death-related thoughts was assessed by a word completion task, and a mood questionnaire was used to measure their distress. Death thoughts fully mediated ostracism distress. Marital status moderated this mediation effect in that no moderation was observed in married participants, suggesting that marriage may buffer death anxiety. The discussion centers on the ways in which these findings contribute to the ostracism and terror management literature by providing empirical evidence that death thoughts mediate ostracism distress, and the moderating effects of marriage on this mediation effect.

The studies were conducted in 2001 and 2003. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that although tortured individuals have a significantly higher trauma dose, they are more resilient, are more socioculturally adjusted, have more posttraumatic growth, and practice their religion more. They are more tolerant of differences in religion, race, and culture, and feel more supported. However, they are less healthy physically than individuals in the community who were not tortured. We used theories of attribution, identity trauma, and cumulative trauma to understand the results. Recommendations for counseling and therapy are discussed.

994,"Exploring the psychological underpinnings of the moral mandate effect: Motivated reasoning, group differentiation, or anger?","When people have strong moral convictions about outcomes, their judgments of both outcome and procedural fairness become driven more by whether outcomes support or oppose their moral mandates than by whether procedures are proper or improper (the moral mandate effect). Two studies tested 3 explanations for the moral mandate effect. In particular, people with moral mandates may (a) have a greater motivation to seek out procedural flaws when outcomes fail to support their moral point of view (the motivated reasoning hypothesis), (b) be influenced by in-group distributive biases as a result of identifying with parties that share rather than oppose their moral point of view (the group differentiation hypothesis), or (c) react with anger when outcomes are inconsistent with their moral point of view, which, in turn, colors perceptions of both outcomes and procedures (the anger hypothesis).

995,"Age is not just a number: Age awareness, subjective nearness-to-death, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms among older adults","Objectives: Humans often hold structured generalizations about themselves, which include attributes of qualities or characteristics they consider as important to their personal self-definitions. In this regard, holding one’s age as an important defining personal category (high age awareness) was demonstrated to be connected with increased distress in older adults. However, little is known about the manner by which this connection is affected by individuals' perceptions regarding how close they are to their death on the one hand, and their personal resources on the other hand. Accordingly, the current research examined whether the connection between age awareness and depressive symptoms is mediated by subjective nearness-to-death, and whether this mediation is moderated by self-esteem.Method: A convenience sample of 386 older adults was collected using an online panel survey (age range 60-97, M = 71.62, {SD} = 6.88). Participants were requested to fill out scales assessing age awareness, subjective nearness-to-death, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms, as well as various sociodemographic scales.Results: Age awareness was associated with increased subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms. In line with the hypotheses, subjective nearness-to-death mediated the age awareness-depressive symptoms connection, and this mediation was moderated by self-esteem.Conclusion: Age awareness is an important concept in old age, and is connected with increased depressive symptoms. We discuss this issue in line with Terror Management Theory, and emphasize the relevance of personal resources, such as feeling far from death and holding a positive view of oneself, in this regard.

997,Reminders of mortality alter pain-evoked potentials in a Chinese sample,"Pain is of evolutionary importance to human survival. However, the perception of pain could be changed when death-related thoughts are accessible. Although the influence of mortality salience ({MS}) on pain processing has been investigated in Westerners recently, it is unclear whether this effect is constrained by specific culture context since humans may employ cultural worldviews to defend the existence problem. The current study tested whether and how {MS} affected pain processing in a Chinese male sample. We primed participants with sentences indicating {MS} or negative affect ({NA}) on either of two days. Both before and after the priming, event-related potentials ({ERPs}) elicited by painful and non-painful electrical stimulations were recorded. Results showed that pain-evoked potentials were identified as an early negative complex N60-P90-N130 and a late positivity P260. Pain-evoked N130 after {MS} priming was larger than that after {NA} priming. Meanwhile, pain-evoked P260 decreased after {MS} priming but not after {NA} priming. These findings indicate that reminders of mortality affect both early sensory and late cognitive neural responses related to physical pain. Although previous studies reporting an increased effect of {MS} on perceived pain intensity in Westerners, we found an unchanged or possibly reduced effect in Chinese. Thus, the current work provides insight into a culture-sensitive perspective on how pain processing would be modulated when existential problem occurs.

998,Paring down life to the essentials: An epicurean psychodynamics of midlife changes,"This article presents a psychodynamic hypothesis about a certain type of productive midlife change often to be observed in creative individuals. This model is called paring down life to the essentials and is connected to the Epicurean tradition. It is exemplified by analyzing the autobiographical narrative of Charles Handy, a leading business philosopher, who at midlife left his previous employment to dedicate himself to writing about the search for meaning in a capitalist world. The psychodynamic interpretation of this process dialectically bridges between Elliot Jacques seminal interpretation of the resolution of the midlife crisis as acceptance of mortality and Ernest Becker’s theory that the denial of death is one of the deepest human motivations—a hypothesis strongly corroborated by empirical research. Focusing life on a heightened process of creation at midlife is shown to reflect both death acceptance and denial of death. It is argued that this model for midlife change could be of importance in contemporary consumerist culture. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Strenger, Carlo",0,,997
999,Response to commentary,"Replies to comments by Dossey and Lomax (see record [rid]2014-39792-004[/rid]) on the original article by Schlitz et al (see record [rid]2014-39792-003[/rid]) concerning gaining perspective on death. As both authors note, gaining perspective on death is vital to clinical practice. Fostering death awareness in a supportive environment allows people to have direct and honest discussions about their views of death and the afterlife. This openness may lead to psychological, spiritual, and biological health and well-being for practitioners and patients alike. Unfortunately, many practitioners feel ill-prepared to discuss death and beliefs about the afterlife with their patients. Schlitz's own recent work aims to deepen death awareness through research and educational programs that explore diverse cultural and spiritual worldviews on death and the afterlife—and why they matter for how we live our lives. Through a documentary film and book entitled Death Makes Life Possible (Schlitz, 2015; Schlitz, 2014), the audience is exposed to profound insights about our relationship to mortality from spiritual, cultural, and scientific leaders. Trainings offered in conjunction with the film invite participants to reflect on their own worldviews and beliefs. The goal is to transform the fear of death into an inspiration for living by encouraging open and respectful conversations around death and the afterlife in small and large group settings.

1000,The impact of death-related media information on consumer value orientation and scope sensitivity,"This research examines how incidental exposure to death-related information in the media affects consumers’ value orientation and scope sensitivity to marketing stimuli. Five studies demonstrate that, in contrast to thoughts about one’s own mortality, exposure to death-related information in the media can shift consumers’ focus from extrinsic to intrinsic values. This leads them to pay less attention to the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing stimuli are associated with intrinsic values. Moreover, we found that exposure to death-related media information will generate effects similar to those of mortality salience when the information is perceived to be self-relevant and thus could induce death anxiety. The authors discuss implications and possible extensions. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Huang, Zhongqiang (Tak) and Huang, Xun (Irene) and Jiang, Yuwei",0,,999
1001,An unscathed past in the face of death: Mortality salience reduces individuals' regrets,"Folk wisdom and popular literature hold that, in the face of death, individuals tend to regret things in their lives that they have done or failed to do. Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), in contrast, allows for the prediction that individuals who are confronted with death try to minimize the experience of regret in order to retain a positive self-esteem. Three experiments put these competing perspectives to test. Drawing on {TMT}, we hypothesized and found that participants primed with their own death regret fewer things than control-group participants. This pattern of results cannot be attributed to differing types of regrets (Study 1). Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that the effect is not purely a product of cognitive mechanisms such as differing levels of construal (Study 2), cognitive contrast, or deficits (Study 3). Rather, the reported results are best explained in terms of a motivational coping mechanism: When death is salient, individuals strive to bolster as well as protect their self-esteem and accordingly try to minimize the experience of regret. The results add to our conceptual understanding of regret and {TMT}, and suggest that a multitude of lifestyle guidebooks need updating.

1002,The dynamics of animal similarity and cultural worldview defense,"According to Terror Management Theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986) a key function of cultural worldviews is facilitating people's belief that they are different from animals and therefore more than physical creatures fated to obliteration upon death. We sought to investigate the relationship between peoples' perceived similarity to animals ({PSA}) and their investment in their ingroup cultural-worldviews, creativity and personal achievement, as ways of managing their awareness of death. We focused on four central hypotheses: (1) high faith in cultural worldviews should reduce {PSA}; (2) people who view themselves less similar to animals (low-{PSA}) should be more invested in their cultural worldview, especially after death primes; (3) people who view themselves as more similar to animals (high-{PSA}), should invest more in personal achievement and creativity as a terror management strategy and (4) be more prone to experience anxiety, particularly after a threat to their creativity. Supporting Hypotheses 1 and 2 we found that: validation of cultural worldviews reduces {PSA} (Study 1); low-{PSA} individuals cared more about their ingroup identity and worldviews and perceived other cultures as more different (Studies 2a-2b); after death primes low-{PSA} individuals defended their groups' cultural worldview more (Studies 3-4), and liked people from other cultures less (Studies 5-6). Hypothesis 3 was partially supported: {PSA} was positively correlated to importance of creativity, openness and performance on a creativity task (Studies 7, 9 and 10), but it was not correlated with self-reported or projected need for achievement (Studies 7 and 8), or with creative story writing (Studies 8). Hypothesis 4 was also partially supported: {PSA} was positively related to trait-anxiety (Study 9), and to levels of death thought accessibility (Study 10), and high-{PSA} individuals experienced more anxiety after receiving negative feedback about their creativity (Study 10). The implications these findings to the field of social psychology are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Lifshin, Uri",1,,1001
1003,Improving the efficacy of appearance-based sun exposure interventions with the terror management health model,"The terror management health model ({TMHM}) suggests that when thoughts of death are accessible people become increasingly motivated to bolster their self-esteem relative to their health, because doing so offers psychological protection against mortality concerns. Two studies examined sun protection intentions as a function of mortality reminders and an appearance-based intervention. In Study 1, participants given a sun protection message that primed mortality and shown a {UV}-filtered photo of their face reported greater intentions to use sun protection on their face, and took more sunscreen samples than participants shown a regular photo of their face. In Study 2, reminders of mortality increased participants’ intentions to use facial sun protection when the {UV} photo was specifically framed as revealing appearance consequences of tanning, compared to when the photo was framed as revealing health consequences or when no photo was shown. These findings extend the {TMHM}, and provide preliminary evidence that appearance-based tanning interventions have a greater influence on sun protection intentions under conditions that prime thoughts of death. We discuss implications of the findings, and highlight the need for additional research examining the applicability to long-term tanning behaviour.

Park (2004) have achieved an admirable integration of the self-esteem literature with their claim that self-esteem is better conceived of as a dynamic human striving, rather than as a passive state or personality characteristic. However, the costs of self-esteem striving may be overstated--these costs may arise only in certain constrained cases. Also, although Crocker and Park suggested that self-esteem is not a true psychological need, there is evidence that humans in all cultures need to feel a positive sense of self-worth (K. M. Sheldon, in press). Problems may arise only when people strive too directly for this feeling, rather than deriving it as a natural concomitant of non-self-focused goals. A 'sidelong' approach to self-esteem need satisfaction is advocated in this commentary. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Sheldon, Kennon M.",0,,1003
1005,It's the thought that counts: The role of hostile cognition in shaping aggressive responses to social exclusion,"Prior research has confirmed a casual path between social rejection and aggression, but there has been no clear explanation of why social rejection causes aggression. A series of experiments tested the hypothesis that social exclusion increases the inclination to perceive neutral information as hostile, which has implications for aggression. Compared to accepted and control participants, socially excluded participants were more likely to rate aggressive and ambiguous words as similar (Experiment 1a), to complete word fragments with aggressive words (Experiment 1b), and to rate the ambiguous actions of another person as hostile (Experiments 2-4). This hostile cognitive bias among excluded people was related to their aggressive treatment of others who were not involved in the exclusion experience (Experiments 2 and 3) and others with whom participants had no previous contact (Experiment 4). These findings provide a first step in resolving the mystery of why social exclusion produces aggression. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","{DeWall}, C.

1006,Adaptive memory: Thinking about function,"Rating the relevance of words for the imagined situation of being stranded in the grasslands without survival material leads to exceptionally good memory for these words. This survival processing effect has received much attention because it promises to elucidate the evolutionary foundations of memory. However, the proximate mechanisms of the survival processing effect have to be identified before informed speculations about its adaptive function are possible. Here, we test and contrast 2 promising accounts of the survival processing effect. According to the 1st account, the effect is the consequence of the prioritized processing of threat-related information. According to the 2nd account, thinking about the relevance of items for survival stimulates thinking about object function, which is a particularly elaborate form of encoding. Experiment 1 showed that the emotional properties of the survival scenario, as manipulated by the negative or positive framing of the scenario, did not influence recall. A focus on threat at encoding led to worse recall than a focus on function. The latter finding was replicated in Experiment 2, which further showed that focusing on threat did not lead to a memory advantage over a pleasantness control condition. The beneficial effect of inducing a functional focus at encoding even surpasses that of the standard survival processing instruction. Together, the results support the theory that thinking about function is an important component of the survival processing effect.

Two studies, with distinct populations, were conducted to test the hypothesis that mortality salience would lead to worldview validation of values related to a salient social identity. In Study 1, reasonable support for this hypothesis was found with bicultural Aboriginal Australian participants (N=97). It was found that thoughts of death led participants to validate ingroup and reject outgroup values depending on the social identity that had been made salient. In Study 2, when their student and Australian identities were primed, respectively, Anglo-Australian students (N=119) validated values related to those identities, exclusively. The implications of the findings for identity-based worldview validation are discussed.

1008,Mortality salience and worldview defense,"Research generated from Terror Management Theory has demonstrated that reminding participants of their eventual death increases self-esteem striving and worldview defense (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Arndt, \& Schimel, 2004). The hypothesis in the present study is that individuals higher in emotion dysregulation will engage in higher levels of worldview defense than those lower in emotion dysregulation. This hypothesis was based on the assumption that individuals high in emotion dysregulation will have a greater need to regulate their emotions by engaging in worldview defense after being asked to think about their own death than will non-emotionally dysregulated individuals. To test this hypothesis, 110 undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to a mortality salience or control condition. All participants completed the Differences in Emotion Regulation Scale ({DERS}). Level of worldview defense was measured by participants’ reactions to pro- vs. anti-American essays. The results were analyzed using a regression model, with {DERS} scores standardized and treated as a continuous measure. The overall regression model was not significant. The regression model was non-significant when condition was entered alone in the first step of the regression equation and remained non-significant when {DERS} scores were entered into the second step. Exploratory analyses examined the moderating role of neuroticism and extraversion; neither significantly moderated the relation between mortality salience and worldview defense. Possible reasons for a failure to achieve a main effect for condition, such as possible experimenter or sample characteristics, are explored. Possible reasons why emotion dysregulation did not moderate the association between mortality salience and worldview defense included failure to achieve a main effect of condition, the possibility that people high in emotion dysregulation 'checked-out' of the study when they began feeling emotional distress, or that emotion dysregulation is simply unrelated to worldview defense following mortality reminders. Future research could explore whether extraversion moderates the relation between mortality salience and worldview defense if and when a main effect of condition is present.

1009,The malicious effects of existential threat on motivation to protect the natural environment and the role of environmental identity as a moderator,"Existential threat, which terror-management theory suggests is associated with greater psychological distance from nature and increased concern for the self, may erode human motivation to protect the natural environment. Environmentally relevant motivations and concerns include desires to protect humans (anthropocentric motivation and egoistic concern) and nature (biocentric motivation and biospheric concern). Experimentally induced mortality salience decreased biocentric but not anthropocentric motivation to protect the environment (Studies 1 and 2) as well as biospheric but not egoistic environmental concern (Study 2). However, moderator effects also suggest how environmentally protective motivations can be sustained despite existential threat. If people conceive of proenvironmental action as serving humans or if it relates to people’s identities, the malicious effects of existential threat on proenvironmental motivation can be eliminated.

1010,The effects of mortality salience and conceptual focus in {CISM} providers: Implications for mental health response to mass fatality disasters,"On the basis of terror management theory ({TMT}) and cognitive-experiential self-theory ({CEST}), research has demonstrated that when individuals are experientially (rather than rationally) focused, mortality salience ({MS}) can engender worldview defense in the form of increased in-group bias, increased favoritism toward others who uphold cultural values, and greater derogation of those who threaten them. The goal of the present study was to replicate previously observed effects of mortality salience on worldview defense in a sample of disaster responders, specifically Critical Incident Stress Management ({CISM}) providers, and to examine the potential moderating effect of conceptual mode (rational versus experiential) on these effects. Sixty-two participants at the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation's 2011 World Congress were selected for participation in the study. Subsequent manipulation checks revealed that neither manipulation (mortality salience: {MS} versus non-{MS} or conceptual mode: rational versus experiential) was effective. This failure is discussed in terms of the potentially mortality salient nature of conference proceedings that preceded data collection, the depletion of self-control resources required to maintain a rational focus on conference presentations, participants 'need to maintain their focus during future conference presentations, and profession-related practice effects that may have made it easier for some participants to maintain a rational focus.

Unger (see record [rid]2007-18356-017[/rid]), on the author's original article (see record [rid]2006-12925-001[/rid]) on ideology. J. T. Jost thanks Glassman and Karno for returning him to his philosophical roots. Glassman and Karno argued in favor of an 'instrumental pragmatist' approach to the study of ideology that emphasizes the strategic, purposive, goal-directed nature of political rhetoric and belief. He agrees that such an approach is helpful and empirically sound. He also agrees that ideological movements are often orchestrated by elites (e.g., party leaders) for strategic political purposes in a top-down manner. There are several other points, however, on which Glassman and Karno seem to misunderstand him. Regarding Unger's comments, Unger pointed out, quite correctly, that Jost said relatively little about the role of religious ideology in his discussion of ideological polarization in the United States. The ideological gulf between religious traditionalists and secular humanists has indeed been widening since 1980, and it corresponds strongly to right-left differences in political attitudes. Jost mentioned, somewhat cryptically, at the end of his article that 'similarly fruitful analyses could be undertaken with respect to religious and other belief systems,' and he is grateful for Unger's invitation to elaborate on this point.

In Study 1, it was hypothesized that expressing any tension produced by writing a counterattitudinal essay would reduce the extent of dissonance-reducing attitude change. To test this hypothesis, Ss were induced to write an essay arguing for higher tuition. High-choice Ss were either encouraged to express their emotions, to suppress them, or to do neither. As expected, high-choice-express Ss exhibited the least attitude change. Study 2 tested the hypothesis that expressing fear of cancer would reduce the extent of defensive distancing from cancer patients, but expressing sympathy would not. Although control Ss clearly distanced from cancer patients, fear-expression Ss did not. Implications for understanding the role of affect in defense are discussed.

1014,"Fear, hope, and the formation of specific intention in genocide - Emotions and mass atrocity: Philosophical and theoretical explorations.","Genocide is most often perpetrated against people who have no effective way to militarily resist. Genocidal policies are the institutionalization of two specific emotions, the author claims, namely fear and hope. Fearful beliefs about an alleged enemy legitimize the political regime as protector of the community against an existential threat, and justify the mass killing as a necessary act of self-defense. Through violence, leaders hope to bring about a better, more secure world. But the emotional complexity of the perpetrators does not stop here, the author contends, because fear is also felt to be shameful. No one wants to feel afraid and no one wants to be seen to be afraid; fear is humiliating and those who experience it tend to feel ashamed. So instead of acknowledging their fear and sense of vulnerability, the perpetrators construct a counter-narrative of invulnerable strength and superiority. Their genocidal policies enact a rejection of vulnerability and an attempt to establish their alleged superiority and strength through violent means. In this fashion, the author concludes, an emotional narrative of vulnerability and a desire for empowerment end in the most aggressive act one group can take against another.

1015,The religious correlates of death anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Various theories of religion hypothesize a connection between death anxiety and religiosity. In particular, Terror Management Theory’s worldview defence hypothesis predicts that death anxiety is lowest among very religious and irreligious individuals, and highest among uncertain individuals. Likewise, the supposition that death anxiety motivates religious belief, which in turn mitigates death anxiety, predicts that religiosity increases with death anxiety among non-believers, and that death anxiety decreases as religiosity increases among believers. In both cases, a curvilinear relationship—specifically, an inverted-U curve—is predicted. We extracted 202 effect sizes from 100 studies for an 'omnibus' religiosity meta-analysis, and six meta-analyses that examine particular dimensions of religiosity. We found high heterogeneity and a weak negative association between death anxiety and religiosity. A closer examination revealed that 10 of the 11 studies that directly tested for curvilinearity provided some support for an inverted-U pattern. The curvilinearity hypothesis cannot be ruled out, but more evidence—particularly on non-religious individuals, and in non-Western, non-Abrahamic contexts—is needed.

Using a cross-sectional survey, the roles of quality of life ({QoL}) and impact of event were examined against death anxiety of the proximate inhabitants of the crash site. Result showed significant influence of {QoL} on death anxiety, with higher {QoL} participants manifesting higher levels of death anxiety. However, impact of the crash event and demographic indicators such as age, sex, pilot preference, and belief-in-life after death did not influence death anxiety of participants.

It is recommended that anxious death-related experiences be prevented in all spheres of life in pursuit of safety and sound mental health of the people.

1017,The two faces of age identity,"As people grow older they develop a sense of a dual age identity, referring to their age group and generation (Weiss \& Lang, 2009). Two studies (N₁ = 37, 60–85 years and N₂ = 104, 65–88 years of age) compared and contrasted older adults’ cognitive representations of two types of age cohort groups (age group vs. generation). Analyses reveal that age-group identity was more frequently associated with loss and decline, whereas generation identity was more frequently associated with positive characteristics and increased levels of agency. Findings also show that generation identity may—especially in later adulthood—serve as a means to compensate for loss. The self-protective function of the dual age identity and the dynamic and flexible nature of identification are further discussed.

1018,'They' are old but 'I' feel younger: Age-group dissociation as a self-protective strategy in old age,"Age becomes an important self-defining aspect particularly during advanced age. With increasing age, negative attributes related to age and aging become salient. Aging-related declines, losses, as well as the finitude of life seem to threaten older adults' sense of self. We hypothesize that older adults will try to avoid the negative consequences of their age group membership by distancing themselves from their age group. Study 1 (N = 544, 65\% women; 18–85 years of age) examined the role of age-group identification for self-conception and self-image (subjective age and future time perspective) across the life span. Results show that weakly identified older adults feel younger than their chronological age and report a more expanded future time perspective relative to their same-age counterparts. A second experiment (N = 68, 69\% women; 65–85 years of age) tested the impact of age stereotypes on older adults' level of age-group identification. Results suggest that older adults are more likely to psychologically dissociate themselves from their age group when negative age stereotypes are salient. Discussion focuses on (mal)adaptive consequences of age-group dissociation in later adulthood.

1019,Taxonomy of trauma and trauma assessment,"A review of the theory of trauma as a special case of stress response theory, two different classifications / taxonomies of traumas emerge. Each taxonomy describes a different dimension of the traumatic event. The first taxonomy, areas of individual functioning, includes five types: Attachment trauma, autonomy or identity trauma, interdependence trauma, achievement or self-actualization trauma, and survival trauma. The second classification is based on experiential objective external criteria and includes two main categories: Factitious or trauma-like and real traumatic events. The first happens in one step transmission from one to one or more persons. The second get transmitted in multiple steps or cross-generationally. Traumas can get transmitted cross generationally in two venues: through family or collectively. Collective transmission of traumas happens in two contexts: historical and social structural. Direct traumas (person-made), on the other hand, is divided into two types: Simple (type I) and complex (type {II}, and type {III}). While type I is a single blow, type {II} is a unit of repeated and connected series of blows. Type {III} is the additive effect of the sequence of all direct, indirect, and factitious traumatic events on one or more of the different areas of functioning across life span. The latter section of the paper describes a Trauma Assessment Matrix to help identify the accumulation of traumatic events and its potentially additive effects in one or more of the five areas of functioning. The treatment implications are addressed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Kira, Ibrahim Aref",0,,1018

According to {TMT}, self-esteem buffers against the potential for death anxiety. Because sport allows people to attain self-esteem, reminders of death may improve performance in sport. In Study 1, a mortality salience induction led to improved performance in a 'one-on-one' basketball game. In Study 2, a subtle death prime led to higher scores on a basketball shooting task, which was associated with increased task-related self-esteem. These results may promote our understanding of sport and provide a novel potential way to improve athletic performance.

1021,"War, worries, and religiousness","Terror management theory posits that death-related threats increase people’s investment in religious activity, dedication, and belief. Given that war usually results in deaths, the authors hypothesized that war, as a death-related threat, would be associated with greater religiousness. The present research assessed this hypothesis with a large worldwide sample (N = 86,272). Using the Global Peace Index and World Value Survey, the authors found that people were more religious (i.e., religious practice, religious identity, and belief in God) when their countries and districts suffered from more wars/conflicts. The positive relationship between war and religiousness was partially explained by worries about war. That is, people in countries with existing war/conflict experienced higher levels of worries about war and, in turn, showed increased religiousness.

1022,Finding meaning in nostalgia,"Nostalgia—defined as sentimental longing for one’s past—is a self-relevant, albeit deeply social, and an ambivalent, albeit more positive than negative, emotion. As nostalgia brings the past into present focus, it has existential implications. Nostalgia helps people find meaning in their lives, and it does so primarily by increasing social connectedness (a sense of belongingness and acceptance), and secondarily by augmenting self-continuity (a sense of connection between one’s past and one’s present). Also, nostalgia-elicited meaning facilitates the pursuit of one’s important goals. Moreover, nostalgia acts as a buffer against existential threats. In particular, it shields against meaning threat, and buffers the impact of mortality salience on meaning, collective identity, accessibility of mortality-related thoughts, and death anxiety. Finally, nostalgia confers psychological benefits to individuals with chronic or momentary meaning deficits. These benefits are higher subjective vitality, lower stress, and regulation of meaning-seeking in response to boredom. Taken together, nostalgia helps people attain a more meaningful life, protects from existential threat, and contributes to psychological equanimity.

1023,Out of the armchair and into the streets: Measuring mindfulness advances knowledge and improves interventions: Reply to Grossman (2011),"We address 3 critiques raised by Grossman (2011) of self-report measures of mindfulness and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}) and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale—Adolescent ({MAAS}–A) in particular. Grossman questioned whether self-report measures actually assess mindfulness, whether the construct of mindfulness can be understood apart from mindfulness training, and whether there is empirical evidence to support the validity of mindfulness measures. In response we discuss established theory that attention (and secondarily meta-awareness) is core to the meaning of mindfulness and is the central feature of the {MAAS} and {MAAS}–A. We then argue that mindfulness is an inherent capacity that varies between and within persons and is not, as Grossman claimed, a concept applicable to only a trained few. Further, as assessed by the {MAAS} and {MAAS}–A, mindfulness is associated with the same variety of outcomes as mindfulness training is theorized to yield. Finally, we provide considerable evidence that the {MAAS} and {MAAS}–A are valid instruments. We conclude that although construct measurement is inevitably imperfect, such efforts are critical to building basic knowledge and refining effective interventions.

1024,"When animals attack: The effects of mortality salience, infrahumanization of violence, and authoritarianism on support for war","Terror management theory ({TMT}) suggests that people are motivated to elevate themselves above other animals as a way of denying their creatureliness and mortality. Based on this reasoning, the present study assessed whether infrahumanizing violence by emphasizing its similarities to animal aggression would lead to reduced support for war, especially when mortality is salient. This hypothesis was supported among participants high in right-wing authoritarianism ({RWA}), who are especially prone to infrahumanize outgroup members and are generally more supportive of military action against outgroups. {RWA} was associated with greater support for war against Iran, except when primed with thoughts of death and violence as an infrahuman behavior. These data suggest that by portraying violence as something instinctual and creaturely, it may be possible to reduce inter-group hostility and aggression among individuals who tend to be more dispositionally aggressive, particularly in the context of the death awareness that often exacerbates inter-group conflict.

It is one of the most prominent fields of research, development, and application of economic decision theories (Kirchler \& Hoelzl, 2006). While increasingly more economists are becoming aware of the relevance of the psychological perspective in advancing understanding of economic phenomena, psychologists often perceive research on consumer behavior and economic decisions as an applied field such as health and clinical psychology, educational psychology, work and organizational psychology, traffic and environmental psychology, or criminal and forensic psychology. We received numerous responses to our call for papers for the present special issue, and from these we chose scholars in the fields of consumer behavior and economic decisions research to report their findings. The goal was to demonstrate to the readers of the Zeitschrift für Psychologie/Journal of Psychology how relevant psychological thinking is in understanding consumer behavior, and how fruitful it can be to learn from economic theorizing to advance psychological research.

Courts that have objected to this use of religion fear that religion will improperly influence jurors' decisions and interfere with their ability to weigh aggravators and mitigators. This study investigated the effects of both prosecution and defense appeals. Prosecution appeals did not affect verdict decisions; however, use of religion by the defense affected both verdicts and the weighing of aggravators and mitigators. These results could be due to differences in perceived sincerity and remorse that are conveyed in the various appeals.

They explore whether approach or avoidance motivation increases the effect that people feel they were treated more fairly following procedures that do versus do not allow them an opportunity to voice their opinion. Experiments 1 and 2 reveal that these procedures influence procedural justice judgments more strongly when people conduct approach motor action (arm flexion) than when they conduct avoidance motor action (arm extension). Experiment 3 indicates that individual-difference measures of participants' approach motivations predicted procedural justice judgments following voice versus no-voice procedures. The authors conclude that people's motivational orientations stimulate their fairness-based reactions to voice procedures.

1029,Predicting the near and distant future,"Four studies investigated individuals' confidence in predicting near future and distant future outcomes. Study 1 found that participants were more confident in theory-based predictions of psychological experiments when these experiments were expected to take place in the more distant future. Studies 2-4 examined participants' confidence in predicting their performance on near and distant future tests. These studies found that in predicting their more distant future performance, participants disregarded the format of the questions (e.g., multiple choice vs. open ended) and relied, instead, on their perceived general knowledge (e.g., history knowledge). Together, the present studies demonstrate that predictions of the more distant future are based on relatively abstract information. Individuals feel more confident in predicting the distant future than the near future when the predictions concern outcomes that are implied by relatively abstract information.

1030,Exploring Whites' recognition of racial microaggressions through an existential lens,"Substantive evidence demonstrates that targets of racial discrimination (i.e., people of color) are acutely aware of racial microaggressions when they occur. Far less research has explored the interpretive experiences of perpetrators and bystanders of race-related prejudice and discrimination, individuals who are typically White. The current study sought to identify personal and situational factors that affect Whites' recognition of racial microaggressions. The sample consisted of self-identified exclusively White/Caucasian adults (N=210) who completed questionnaires exploring Belief in a Just World ({BJW}), Social Dominance Orientation ({SDO}), and three facets of Ethnocultural Empathy (Awareness, Perspective-Taking, and Empathic Action). Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two primes (a) mortality salience or (b) neutral, and were then presented with vignettes to evaluate. It was hypothesized that participants who experienced mortality salience prior to judging racially microaggressive vignettes would be less likely to identify the vignettes as microaggressive. Analyses revealed that there were no significant differences between the mortality salience group and control group on their recognition of racial microaggressions. However, {BJW}, {SDO}, Awareness, Perspective-Taking, and Empathic Action each independently predicted Whites' recognition of racial microaggressions. Among these five independent variables, Awareness (awareness of contemporary racism and privilege) emerged as the predominant predictive variable in an all-inclusive model. Future directions include replication of these findings and refining a measure of microaggression recognition.

1031,Existential assessment of mortality-induced growth and defensiveness with the rotter incomplete sentences blank,"The traditional mortality salience ({MS}) induction in terror management theory ({TMT}) research invokes maladaptive worldview and self-esteem defenses related to extrinsic life values (Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, \& Lyon, 1989). Cozzolino et al. (2004; 2009) validated a death reflection manipulation as an alternative paradigm that allows for mortality-induced growth and focus on intrinsic life values. The current study utilized a mixed methods design to advance these findings by exploring if {MS} and death reflection differentially activate the existential system as proposed by Yalom (1980) with the inclusion of a control condition and the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank ({RISB}-College Form; Rotter, Lah, \& Rafferty, 1992). Results indicated a significantly greater prevalence of existential themes in the control group as compared to experimental conditions, and a significantly greater prevalence of neutral themes in the death reflection condition as compared to the control group. The control group also yielded significantly higher maladjustment in Overall Adjustment Scores ({OAS}) than the experimental conditions. Exploratory analyses revealed that the death reflection condition had the highest proportional discrepancy between adjusted and maladjusted {RISB} profiles with greater overall adjustment. The death reflection condition also evidenced qualitatively different types of defensive responses in a small proportion of profiles. The results are explained through the lens of existential experimental psychology followed by a review of the utility of the {RISB} as an existential assessment instrument and implications for the therapy process.

1032,Terror management theory and individual differences,"This dissertation consists largely of an extension of terror management theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986) with its primary focus on the relationship between death anxiety and adherence to societal standards and mores. It investigates the hypothesis that individual belief systems, specifically communitarian beliefs (as opposed to individualistic) and Eastern or Western religious (as opposed to Western materialistic) concepts of self and death will mitigate the experience and expression of death anxiety. This is proposed because it seems crucial that we begin to look at individual differences in response to death awareness, specifically the transpersonal conception and communitarian views of self as part of a meaningful and moral societal whole. The study proposes that there is theoretical evidence to hypothesize that there may be an inverse relationship between the strength of an Eastern/Western religious spiritual belief system and the amount of death anxiety experienced as well as an inverse relationship between the strength of communitarian beliefs and the experience of death anxiety. Results suggest that subjects exposed to a message designed to make their mortality salient recommend higher bonds for a hypothetical transgressor of societal values. They did not however recommend higher rewards for one who upheld societal standards as would be predicted by Terror Management Theory. In the reward scenarios there was a pattern of non-significant differences on reward based on individual's values within each of the conditions and there appeared to be a difference between those patterns. This might be interpreted as support for the thesis that people respond differently to the mortality salience manipulation based on their ethical values and religious sensitivity. This interpretation is qualified by the fact that the differences observed were not statistically significant and the measure used has not been sufficiently validated.

1033,"Cultural differences in self-awareness in adolescence pathways to spiritual awareness - Values, religion, and culture in adolescent development.","Self-awareness increases dramatically for adolescents worldwide. We seek to understand how cultural differences in self-awareness may contribute to cultural differences in spiritual awareness among adolescents. The focus is on comparisons between European-Americans and East Asians. There is little research on cultural differences in self-awareness, despite substantial evidence of cultural differences in its key components: (1) the vantage point of awareness—whether it is a first person perspective, from the inside-out (European-Americans) or a third person perspective, from the outside-in (East Asians); (2) the conception of self and of standards—whether self is seen as relatively independent and standards are based on personal desires and ideals (European-Americans) or self is seen as interdependent and standards are based on social obligations and norms (East Asians); and (3) the nature of self-evaluation—whether it is focused on enhancing esteem (European-Americans) or maintaining face (East Asians). We suggest that self-awareness may activate mortality salience and thereby may elicit cultural worldviews. Cultural differences in self-awareness leads to different spiritualities that present different 'worldview' defenses against the existential concerns engendered by the interaction of self-awareness and mortality salience. Salvation through prayer and through good deeds, and approval from a loving God, common in Christianity, alleviate European-Americans' mortality concerns. By contrast, meditation, self change, and unity with the universe, common in Buddhism, alleviate East Asians' mortality concerns.

1034,Where health and death intersect: Insights from a terror management health model,"This article offers an integrative understanding of the intersection between health and death from the perspective of the terror management health model. After highlighting the potential for health-related situations to elicit concerns about mortality, we turn to the question, how do thoughts of death influence health-related decision making? Across varied health domains, the answer depends on whether these cognitions are in conscious awareness or not. When mortality concerns are conscious, people form healthy intentions and engage in healthy behavior if efficacy and coping resources are present. In contrast, when contending with accessible but nonconscious thoughts of death, health-relevant decisions are guided more by the implications of the behavior for the individual’s sense of cultural value. Finally, we present research suggesting how these processes can be leveraged to facilitate health promotion and reduce health risk.

1035,Cultural influences on terror management: Independent and interdependent self-esteem as anxiety buffers,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) proposes that self-esteem serves as a defense against the fear of death. Previous research has suggested that independent self-esteem is more salient in individualist cultures, whereas interdependent self-esteem is more salient in collectivist cultures. Thus, we hypothesized that in collectivist cultures, independent self-esteem would play a lesser role and interdependent self-esteem a greater role in terror management, compared to individualist cultures. The results support this prediction. In Study 1, personal self-esteem was negatively associated with death anxiety in samples from a Western (Austria) and Eastern (China) culture. However, both self-liking and self-competence were negatively associated with death anxiety among Austrian participants, but only self-liking (and not self-competence) was so among Chinese participants. Surprisingly, collective self-esteem was not significantly correlated with death anxiety. Yet, Study 2 showed that among Chinese participants, relational self-esteem was negatively associated with death anxiety. Study 3 examined the roles of relational versus personal self-esteem in moderating the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Among Chinese participants, relational rather than personal self-esteem increased the defense of worldviews centered on collectivist-Chinese values following mortality salience (Study 3a). In contrast, among Austrian participants, personal rather than relational self-esteem attenuated the effect of mortality salience on the defense of individualist-Austrian worldviews (Study 3b). Self-esteem serves a terror management function in both collectivist and individualist cultures; however, the differences between cultural worldviews determine the type of self-esteem that is more relevant to terror management processes.

1036,Surviving the Holocaust: A meta-analysis of the long-term sequelae of a genocide,"The current set of meta-analyses elucidates the long-term psychiatric, psychosocial, and physical consequences of the Holocaust for survivors. In 71 samples with 12,746 participants Holocaust survivors were compared with their counterparts (with no Holocaust background) on physical health, psychological well-being, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychopathological symptomatology, cognitive functioning, and stress-related physiology. Holocaust survivors were less well adjusted, as apparent from studies on nonselected samples (trimmed combined effect size d = 0.22, 95\% {CI} [0.13, 0.31], N = 9,803) and from studies on selected samples (d = 0.45, 95\% {CI} [0.32, 0.59], N = 2,943). In particular, they showed substantially more posttraumatic stress symptoms (nonselect studies: d = 0.72, 95\% {CI} [0.46, 0.98], N = 1,763). They did not lag, however, much behind their comparisons in several other domains of functioning (i.e., physical health, stress-related physical measures, and cognitive functioning) and showed remarkable resilience. The coexistence of stress-related symptoms and good adaptation in some other areas of functioning may be explained by the unique characteristics of the symptoms of Holocaust survivors, who combine resilience with the use of defensive mechanisms. In most domains of functioning no differences were found between Israeli samples and samples from other countries. The exception was psychological well-being: For this domain it was found that living in Israel rather than elsewhere can serve as a protective factor. A biopsychological stress-diathesis model is used to interpret the findings, and future directions for research and social policy are discussed.

However, research has not systematically examined the potential antecedents underlying such intentions. Using behavioral intention theory as an underlying framework, this study hypothesized that reasons for working (intrinsic and extrinsic), the will to live, disability severity, accessibility of travel, and age would predict intentions to work during terminal illness. A representative sample of medically diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a.k.a. Lou Gehrig's disease) patients with a mean life expectancy of approximately 3 years participated (mean age=57.8 years). Controlling for length of diagnosis, employment status, and demographic variables, results indicated that intrinsic reasons were particularly strong predictors of intentions, followed by age, disability severity, and accessibility of travel. Exploratory findings also indicated that behavioral intentions were positively related to future employment status, consistent with past theory.

The present studies assessed whether the salience of aggressive tendencies that humans share with other animals make thoughts of death salient and whether depicting human aggression as animalistic can mitigate aggressive behaviour and support for aggression. In Study 1, participants primed with human–animal similarities (i.e., human creatureliness) exhibited elevated death‐thought accessibility ({DTA}) after hitting a punching bag. In Studies 2a and 2b, creatureliness priming caused participants to hit a punching bag with less frequency, perceived force, and comfort. In Study 3, participants primed to view violence as animalistic exhibited increased {DTA} and reported less support for war against Iran. These studies suggest that portraying violence as creaturely may reduce the intensity of aggressive actions and support for violent solutions to international conflicts.

1039,"Supernatural beliefs, unconscious threat and judgment bias in Tibetan Buddhists","Individuals who have been subtly reminded of death display heightened in-group favoritism, or 'worldview defense.' Terror management theory argues (i) that death cues engender worldview defense via psychological mechanisms specifically evolved to suppress death anxiety, and (ii) that the core function of religiosity is to suppress death anxiety. Thus, terror management theory predicts that extremely religious individuals will not evince worldview defense. Here, two studies are presented in support of an alternative perspective. According to the unconscious vigilance hypothesis, subtly processed threats (which need not pertain to death) heighten sensitivity to affectively valenced stimuli (which need not pertain to cultural attitudes). From this perspective, religiosity mitigates the influence of mortality-salience only insofar as afterlife doctrines reduce the perceived threat posed by death. Tibetan Buddhism portrays death as a perilous gateway to rebirth rather than an end to suffering; faith in this doctrine should therefore not be expected to nullify mortality-salience effects. In Study 1, devout Tibetan Buddhists who were subtly reminded of death produced exaggerated aesthetic ratings unrelated to cultural worldviews. In Study 2, devout Tibetan Buddhists produced worldview defense following subliminal exposure to non-death cues of threat. The results demonstrate both the domain-generality of the process underlying worldview defense and the importance of religious doctrinal content in moderating mortality-salience effects.

In the current research we examined whether mortality salience would increase attitudes of forgiveness toward such individuals, especially among those with high trait empathy. Consistent with prior research, Study 1 showed that mortality salience increased forgiveness of a violent hockey player, but only if this person was a member of the ingroup. Study 2 showed that mortality (vs. dental pain) salience led persons high in trait empathy to forgive the same violent hockey player regardless of his group membership. Implications for increasing forgiveness and prosocial behavior in intergroup contexts are briefly discussed.

1041,A stairway to heaven: A terror management theory perspective on morality - Atlas of moral psychology.,"Why do people care about living up to moral values? From a terror management perspective, they care because doing so enables them to view themselves as enduring, significant contributors to a meaningful world who will continue to exist after death, either literally by qualifying for an afterlife, or symbolically, by contributing to something greater than themselves that will last forever. Terror management theory ({TMT}) posits that moral values are part of the cultural worldviews that protect people from anxiety triggered by their awareness of the certainty of death and that these worldviews set forth the standards from which moral behavior is both enacted and evaluated. Further, because individuals are socialized into their culture’s worldview, beginning shortly after birth and continuing through the remainder of their lives, morality is manifested in culturally and individually variable ways. Although variable in composition, the formation of cultural worldviews and their standards for moral behavior and moral judgment operate through a universal human process designed to maintain a sense of meaning and safety that provides protection against anxiety and the hope of transcending death. The purpose of this chapter is to use {TMT} to shed light on the nature and function of moral thought and behavior.

1042,Clinical consensus strategies for interpersonal problems between young adults and their parents,"Objective: Research that identifies areas of agreement among expert therapists can complement findings from clinical trials by highlighting common practices as well as innovations. The present study accessed consensus among expert therapists on the effectiveness of clinical strategies for treating young adults experiencing interpersonal problems with their parents. Method: This study drew on the behavioral–analytic model (Goldfried \& D’Zurilla, 1969) and the methodology of the Expert Consensus Guideline Series (Frances, Kahn, Carpenter, Ross, \& Docherty, 1996). In Phase I, 54 therapists (mean age = 60.32 years; 55.6\% women, 44.4\% men; 96.3\% White/European American) provided clinical situations involving young adult clients and their parents. In Phase {II}, 171 therapists (mean age = 59.45 years; 47.4\% women, 52.0\% men; 91.8\% White/European American) proposed responses to the situations, and more general clinical strategies underlying the responses were identified. In Phase {III}, 134 peer-nominated expert therapists (a mean of 22.33 therapists per situation; mean age = 55.46 years; 61.2\% women, 34.3\% men; 91.0\% White/European American) rated the effectiveness of these clinical strategies. Results: Results indicated that the experts reached consensus on strategies rated as highly effective; in particular, they agreed on the value of exploring clients’ emotional experience and providing validation. Participants reached greater agreement on strategies for use in future sessions than strategies for immediate use.

1043,Older adults and the fear of death: The protective function of generativity,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) posits that cultural worldviews function to allay concerns about human mortality. Preliminary research with older adults has indicated that seniors do not respond to death reminders in the same way as their younger counterparts. The purpose of the current study was to test a developmentally relevant construct that may buffer death anxiety in later life. It was hypothesized that Erikson’s concept of generativity may encompass death-denying properties for older adults. One hundred and seventy-nine seniors were recruited to determine if subtle mortality salience inductions would lead participants to rate their own generativity as higher than after a blatant induction, or no induction, after controlling for pre-induction generativity. As expected, participants exposed to subtle death primes rated themselves as having higher levels of generativity than the other two groups after co-varying pre-induction generativity. Explanations are discussed in light of the literatures on {TMT} and generativity.

1044,Responses of employees to cultural adaptation by a foreign manager,"This study examined how an often advocated strategy for bridging cultural distance in international business relationships affected participants' responses and behavioral intentions. Participants were employees (N = 223) in the {US} subsidiaries of Japanese manufacturing firms. The context was simulated by having participants respond to videotapes of a Japanese manager interacting with American subordinates. Cultural adaptation by the foreign manager was positively related to perceptions of similarity and managerial effectiveness and was negatively related to internal causal attributions for the manager's behavior. Attributions were directly related to participants' intentions to trust and perceptions of managerial effectiveness and moderated the relationship between perceptions of similarity and intentions to associate. Effects of participants' stereotypic expectations and the importance of nationality to their self-esteem were also explored.

1045,Avoidance behavior following terror event exposure: Effects of perceived life threat and Jewish religious coping,"The current research was designed to examine associations of perceived life threat ({PLT}) and religious coping with the development of avoidance behavior following terror event exposure. Based upon the terror management theory ({TMT}), we hypothesized that religious coping, through its effect on religious beliefs as a meaning system, would moderate the impact of threat, as expressed in {PLT}, on an individual's reaction to terror event exposure, as manifested in avoidance behavior. Participants were 591 Israeli Jewish students who were vicariously or directly exposed to a terror event in the past. We report a significant interaction between {PLT} and negative religious coping. {PLT} was positively associated with avoidance behavior but this relationship was more profound among persons who reported high negative religious coping. Secular students reported higher rates of avoidance behavior and negative religious coping and were more likely than religious students to report intrapersonal religious conflict. Our findings suggest that terror event exposure is associated with an elevated sense of threat, which is, at least in part, associated with a weakening of prior religious beliefs.

1046,Self-affirmation reduces smokers' defensiveness to graphic on-pack cigarette warning labels,"Objective: Little is known about how smokers respond to graphic images depicting the health consequences of smoking. The authors tested whether smokers respond defensively to such images and whether allowing them to self-affirm reduces their defensiveness. Design: Young smokers (N = 87) were randomly allocated to self-affirm or perform a control task prior to viewing 4 images intended for future use on cigarette packs in the European Union. Measures were taken immediately postexposure and after 1 week. Main Outcome Measures: Participants rated each image for threat and personal relevance. Once all 4 images had been viewed, they completed measures of intentions, self-efficacy, and perceived behavioral control for reducing cigarette consumption, negative thoughts and feelings about smoking, personal vulnerability to 6 smoking-related diseases, desire to quit, and plans to quit. At the 1-week follow-up, measures of self-reported smoking and desire to reduce consumption were taken. Results: Relative to controls, self-affirmed participants rated the images as more threatening and personally relevant, and they reported more negative thoughts and feelings and higher levels of control, self-efficacy, and intentions. Risk level moderated the effect of self-affirmation on relevance and intentions: Self-affirmation increased ratings on both measures among those who smoked more. In addition, self-affirmation moderated the threat-intention relationship, which was weaker in the self-affirmed group. At follow-up, motivation to reduce consumption remained higher in self-affirmed participants, but there were no differences in reported consumption. Conclusion: Self-affirmation can promote less defensive responding even to visual material about well-established health risks such as smoking.

1047,Expressions of cultural worldviews in psychotherapy with clients who have experienced trauma: A qualitative study from a terror management perspective,"People who have experienced trauma involving serious threats to physical integrity can react in accordance with various response trajectories, including posttraumatic growth ({PTG}). {PTG} is characterized by positive psychological change following trauma that goes beyond a return to pre-trauma functioning as the result of reorganizing one's conceptualization of his or her phenomenological world (Tedeschi \& Calhoun, 2004). This study was interested in factors that contribute to {PTG} from a terror management theory ({TMT}) perspective. {TMT}, based on existential philosophy, posits that people defend against the knowledge that everyone must eventually die and the accompanying anxiety by investing in cultural worldviews and deriving self-esteem by adhering to the standards and values prescribed by those worldviews (Solomon et al., 2004). Based on {TMT} research that suggests that when people are reminded of their mortality they tend to place increased faith in their cultural worldviews (Burke et al., 2010) as well as the assumption that reminders of previous trauma would likely make mortality salient, this study employed a directed content analysis to examine cultural worldview expressions among therapy clients who had experienced trauma. Qualitative analysis using the directed coding system created for this study resulted in coding 77 cultural worldviews across the 5 sessions from 5 coding categories: other (explicit) (n=32), other (implicit) (n=20), nationality (n=13), religion (n=8), and ethnicity (n=4). The clients referred to cultural worldviews throughout their sessions, even though only one therapist directly facilitated cultural discussion. Worldview expressions amidst trauma discussions were considered potential contributors to {PTG} as they served a meaning making function. Also, many worldviews and cultural affiliations referenced were different than those commonly studied in previous {TMT} research (i.e. referenced cultural affiliations other than religion, ethnicity, nationality, or political affiliation such as gender and age/generation; did not discuss political affiliation). Multiple factors such as differences among clients, contextual factors of the sessions, and therapists' style were considered to potentially have influenced the variance in worldviews expressed. The findings described in this study can contribute to ongoing psychotherapy training and research bridging the gaps among {PTG} and {TMT} theory, research and clinical practice with trauma survivors.

1048,Beyond buffering: An empirical investigation of the interconnective self-construal as a mediator in existential death anxiety,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), an existentially grounded social psychological theory, asserts that death anxiety is a chronic human problem and attempts to manage this anxiety often contribute to socially harmful defensive behaviors. The current work draws on Buddhist theory to offer an alternative interpretation of death anxiety. Through a Buddhist lens, the concept of death anxiety is reframed as nonbeing terror which can be reduced by emphasizing interconnected aspects of the self. Preliminary research into humility and quiet ego seems to support this perspective and offers hope for addressing existential fears without contributing to social tensions. Three studies are presented here which investigate the role of self in death anxiety and the potential of an interconnective self-construal to buffer death anxiety while also reducing socially harmful defensive behaviors. Study 1 utilized a loss of self prompt to investigate the effects of loss of self on fear of death and moral disengagement. Study 2 used a mortality salience prompt to investigate the effects of death reminders on willingness to pursue digital immortality (an attempt to save the self without the body). Study 3 utilized an interconnectivity prime to investigate the potential mediating effects of interconnectivity on Islamophobia (an indication of worldview defense). These studies did not yield significant quantitative results, however quantitative and content analyses across studies produced a number of valuable insights. The overall results of these studies suggest that compassionate and experiential interconnectivity may hold more promise than a sense of interconnectivity alone.

1049,No atheists in foxholes: Arguments for (but not against) afterlife belief buffers mortality salience effects for atheists,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) posits that people cope with mortality concerns via symbolic immortality (e.g., secular cultural beliefs that outlast death) and/or literal immortality (afterlife belief). However, what happens when these two forms of immortality conflict, as in atheism? Would atheists’ mortality concerns be better assuaged by affirming an afterlife, or by affirming their literal immortality-denying worldview? Drawing on an untested {TMT} hypothesis, we predicted that atheists would be buffered from mortality concerns if their atheistic worldview—no life after death—was challenged, but not if it was supported. Results confirmed the hypothesis and were also found for theists and agnostics. These findings support {TMT}’s claim that literal immortality is of paramount importance in ameliorating death concerns.

On the basis of the literature, the authors proposed that salience of the general concept of status leads people to be more attentive to procedural fairness information and that, as a consequence, stronger procedural fairness effects should be found. In correspondence with this hypothesis, Experiment 1 showed stronger procedural fairness effects on people's relational treatment evaluations in a status salient condition compared with a control condition. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and, in further correspondence with the hypothesis, showed that status salience led to increased cognitive accessibility of fairness concerns. Implications for the psychology of procedural justice are discussed.

1051,Profound versus superficial coping with mortality threats: Action orientation moderates implicit but not explicit outgroup prejudice,"Mortality salience ({MS}) strengthens cultural values but individuals might differ in whether this process operates at a superficial, explicit level only or also at a profound, implicit level. Two studies investigated whether explicit and implicit attitudes toward Muslims after an {MS} induction vary as a function of threat-related action orientation ({AOT}), an efficient form of self-regulation of emotion and behavior that draws on the activation of the implicit, integrated self. In Study 1, there was a main effect of {MS} on explicit prejudice but only participants with high levels of {AOT} showed reduced implicit prejudice following {MS}. In Study 2, this interaction effect was replicated using an alternative implicit measure of prejudice. Defense in response to {MS} might thus not be a uniform phenomenon but might be composed of processes operating on different (i.e., profound vs. superficial) levels that vary with types of self-regulation such as high versus low {AOT}.

1052,"Spirituality, religious coping, and depressive symptoms in hospice patients: A terror management perspective","Facing imminent death can be an unremitting problem for hospice patients who lack psychological support for existential concerns that contribute to depressive symptoms and suffering. According to terror management theory, spiritual and religious beliefs are a common means of coping with mortality at the end of life, and few studies have considered how hospice patients feel about their impending death. This was a quantitative, cross-sectional study that examined whether spirituality and religious coping moderated the relationship between imminent death concerns and depressive symptoms in 54 hospice patients. Participants completed a self-administered survey that included the Templer Death Anxiety scale, Brief {RCOPE}, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-Being scale. Data analyses included multiple regression, Pearson correlation, independent sample t tests, and Cronbach's alpha test of reliability. Spirituality and religious coping did not significantly moderate the relationship between imminent death concerns and depressive symptoms. Total spirituality, meaning, and peace were significant predictors of depressive symptoms. A recommendation is to develop more research using terror management theory with participants such as hospice patients who are directly facing their imminent death. Positive social change is promoted by highlighting the importance of discussing death and dying with hospice patients, and recognizing religion and spirituality as valid influences to psychological health. This study's findings could lead to further research in developing psychological interventions that target depression and minimize existential distress for patients at the end of their life.

1053,Attachment security and existential distress among patients with advanced cancer,"Background: Felt security in close relationships may affect individual adaptation responses to existential threat in severe illness. We examined the contribution of attachment security to demoralization, a state of existential distress involving perceived pointlessness and meaninglessness in advanced cancer. Method: A mixed cross-sectional sample of 382 patients with advanced cancer (mean age 59, 60\% female) was recruited from outpatient oncology clinics. Participants completed self-report measures of attachment security, demoralization, depression, and physical symptom burden. We used multiple linear regression to analyze the association between attachment security and demoralization, controlling for demographic factors and symptom burden and tested whether attachment security moderated the association of symptom burden with demoralization. Separate analyses compared the contribution of the dimensions of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. Results: The prevalence of clinically relevant demoralization was 35\%. Demoralization was associated with lower attachment security (β = −0.54, 95\%{CI}: −0.62 to 0.46). This effect was empirically stronger for attachment anxiety (β = 0.52, 95\%{CI}: 0.44 to 0.60) compared to attachment avoidance (β = 0.36, 95\%{CI}: 0.27 to 0.45). Attachment security also significantly moderated the association of physical symptom burden with demoralization, such that with less attachment security, there was a stronger association between symptom burden and demoralization. Conclusion: Attachment security may protect from demoralization in advanced cancer. Its relative lack, particularly on the dimension of attachment anxiety, may limit adaptive capacities to deal with illness burden and to sustain morale and purpose in life. An understanding of individual differences in attachment needs can inform existential interventions for severely ill individuals.

In the three studies, Israeli university students completed an attachment style scale, were assigned to a mortality salience or neutral condition, and then completed scales tapping specific relationship strivings and beliefs. Study 1 (N=04) examined participants' willingness to initiate social interactions with a hypothetical same-sex person; Study 2 (N=100) examined appraisals of interpersonal competence; and Study 3 (N=108) examined reports of rejection sensitivity. Findings revealed that mortality salience led to more willingness to initiate social interactions, lower rejection sensitivity and more positive appraisals of interpersonal competence than a control condition. These mortality salience effects were found mainly among persons who scored low on attachment anxiety or attachment avoidance. Findings were discussed in light of the terror management function of close relationships.

According to research on terror management theory, reminding people of their own death strengthens worldview-bolstering reactions, such as following cultural standards and supporting people who uphold those standards. Assuming Snowden’s disclosures were motivated by fighting for the truth and for the value of honesty, and further that cultural values become more important under mortality salience, we hypothesized that reminding people on their own death increases heroic perceptions of Snowden. As predicted, results of our study indicated that participants in the mortality salience condition reported stronger heroic perceptions compared to a control group.

Individuals higher on intrinsic religiosity exhibited more forgiveness when reminded of their mortality than when they were not. This effect of mortality salience was not evident among those lower on intrinsic religiosity. These results extend the generality of a previous finding regarding forgiveness and existential anxiety and demonstrate forgiveness as a religious value for the intrinsically religious Christian. They also replicate findings that mortality salience can, in some circumstances, lead to an increase in prosocial behavior and attitudes.

1059,State anger and prefrontal brain activity: Evidence that insult-related relative left-prefrontal activation is associated with experienced anger and aggression,"Research has demonstrated that left-prefrontal cortical activity is associated with positive affect, or approach motivation, and that right-prefrontal cortical activity is associated with negative affect, or withdrawal motivation. In past research, emotional valence (positive–negative) has been confounded with motivational direction (approach–withdrawal), such that, for instance, the only emotions examined were both positive and approach related. Recent research has demonstrated that trait anger, a negative but approach-related emotion, is associated with increased left-prefrontal and decreased right-prefrontal activity, suggesting that prefrontal asymmetrical activity is associated with motivational direction and not emotional valence. The present experiment tested whether state-induced anger is associated with relative left-prefrontal activity and whether this prefrontal activity is also associated with aggression.

1061,Objects become her: The role of mortality salience on men's attraction to literally objectified women,"From the perspective of terror management theory, men's attraction to women poses a threat in the context of salient mortality concerns. We hypothesized that literal objectification—associating women with (non-mortal) objects—reduces this threat. Reactions to advertisements featuring sexually provocative women merged with objects (e.g., a woman merged with a bottle of beer), or control ads in which the women were separated from the objects, were examined in conjunction with a mortality salience manipulation. Replicating previous research (Landau et al., 2006), men, but not women, reported lower attractiveness ratings for the (non-merged) woman in response to a morality reminder. In contrast, men's attractiveness ratings for the merged (i.e., literally objectified) woman increased when mortality was salient. Further, men primed with mortality reported higher attractiveness ratings for the merged woman, compared to the same woman depicted as separate from an object. These findings help explain the prevalence and appeal of literal objectification, and provide evidence of its existential function.

A dimensional structure by which people perceive interrogation techniques was identified. Mortality salience was found to induce higher levels of acceptance of violent and demeaning techniques, but no other significant effects were found. In line with terror management theory, the effect of mortality salience on only the perceived acceptability of violent interrogation techniques suggests that people may be motivated to endorse the usage of punitive techniques on military prisoners, regardless of the perceived effectiveness of these techniques.

Patients with {BD} (n = 36), patients with {MDD} (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20) completed a task that required unscrambling 6-word strings into 5-word sentences, leaving out 1 word. The extra word allowed the sentences to be completed in a negative, neutral, or 'hyperpositive' (manic/goal-oriented) way. Participants completed the sentences under conditions of cognitive load (rehearsing a 6-digit number), reward (a bell tone), load and reward, or neither load nor reward. We hypothesized that patients with {BD} would engage in more active suppression of negative and hyperpositive thoughts than would controls, as revealed by their unscrambling more word strings into negative or hyperpositive sentences. Under conditions of load or reward and in the absence of either load or reward, patients with {BD} unscrambled more negative sentences than did controls. Under conditions of reward, patients with {BD} unscrambled more negative sentences than did patients with {MDD}. Patients with {BD} also reported more use of negative thought suppression than did controls. These group differences in negative biases were no longer significant when current mood states were controlled.

1064,God save us: A terror management perspective on morality - The social psychology of morality.,"Awareness of death and the emergence of conceptions of noncorporeal souls, deities, and afterlives transform moral behavior from a means of staying in the good graces of others to a strategy for transcending death. Thus the emergence of death awareness a critical turning point in the moral evolution of our species. Research has shown that thoughts of death affect judgments and behavior related to each of the moral intuitions specified by Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt \& Joseph, 2004), that threats to many of them increase death thought accessibility (Hirschberger, 2006), and that terror management processes play an important role in both prosocial and antisocial behavior. From the perspective of terror management theory ({TMT}), awareness of the inevitability of death transforms the primitive moral intuitions that initially evolved to facilitate group living into a central means of managing anxiety regarding human vulnerability and mortality.

In all 16 nations, higher than usual weekly Google search volume for life-threatening illnesses (cancer, diabetes, and hypertension) predicted increases in search volume for religious content (e.g., God, Jesus, prayer) in the following week. This effect held up after controlling for (a) recent past and annual variation in religious search volume, (b) increases in search volume associated with religious holidays, and (c) variation in searches for a non-life-threatening illness ('sore throat'). Terror management threat reduction processes appear to occur across the globe. Furthermore, they may occur over much longer periods than those studied in the laboratory.

None of these qualities can very easily be thought of as positive these days, and much of the time they will tend to be marked with disapproval, sympathy, or revulsion and to be regarded as failings rather than qualities. At least two of them, shyness and reticence, have been characterized as a mental disorder, in the form of social anxiety or social phobia. There are many interesting things to be said about the nature, appearances, and functions of shyness, but very few of them can be said in a literature that is concerned with identifying the causes and treating the effects of shyness. In a world that promotes assertion, agency, and empowerment, this book challenges us to revalue a range of actions and attitudes that have come to be disregarded or dismissed as merely passive. Mercy, resignation, politeness, restraint, gratitude, abstinence, losing well, apologizing, taking care: today, such behaviors are associated with negativity or lack. But the capacity to give way is better understood as positive action, at once intricate and demanding. Moving from intra-human common courtesies to human-animal relations and the global civility of human-inhuman ecological awareness, the book's argument unfolds on progressively larger scales. In reminding us of the existential threat our drives pose to our own survival, the author does not merely champion a family of behaviors; he shows that we are more adept practitioners of them than we realize. The book thus offers a powerful defense of civility, the versatile human capacity to deflect aggression into sociability and to exercise power over power itself.

In the context of terror management theory, this has been explained by the death‐transcending quality of art to convey cultural meaning. In two studies, we examined psychological and neurocognitive responses to naturalistic and surrealistic art when death was primed. We found that naturalistic paintings were evaluated similarly in terms of personal reassurance in both mortality salience and control condition, whereas surrealistic paintings were evaluated as more reassuring in the mortality salience condition than in the control condition. Using high‐field functional magnetic resonance imaging in a second study, we found a similar pattern of results, showing specific activation in the precuneus, a brain area associated with self‐related operations, in all prime conditions for the viewing of naturalistic paintings, but only in the death and disgust prime conditions when viewing surrealistic paintings. Our results suggest motivated self‐reference when viewing both naturalistic and surrealistic artworks under mortality salience.

1069,"Religious belief, authenticity, posttraumatic stress, and existential well-being in combat veterans: A correlation study","This correlational study addressed the problem of posttraumatic stress in combat veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. After combat, significant numbers of these veterans experience an inability to reintegrate into society and increased incidences of alcoholism, drug use, suicide, and other disorders due to posttraumatic stress symptoms. Previous research has emphasized religious belief and spirituality as providing unique meaning-making and resiliency functions in the face of trauma, but it largely ignored or misconceived non-religious worldviews. Using existentialism as a theoretical framework, combat-related posttraumatic stress was conceptualized as an existential crisis arising from the forced confrontation of issues of isolation, mortality salience, moral injury, and loss of meaning caused by the horrors of war. It was hypothesized that an authentic worldview, regardless of the veteran's religious belief, would correlate to lower posttraumatic stress symptoms and higher levels of existential well-being. That is, authentic atheists would be just as likely to find meaning in their combat experiences as authentic religious veterans. To evaluate these relationships, an online survey administered to a sample (n = 212) of veteran volunteers recruited through postings on Facebook and Reddit.com and snowball sampling. Linear regression and multiple regression were conducted to test the predicted relationships. Contrary to previous research, religious belief was not found to be significantly correlated to authenticity, F(4, 207) = 2.139, p = .077, posttraumatic stress symptoms, F(4, 207) = 1.275, p = .281, or existential well-being, F(4, 207) = 2.20, p = .070. Extending previous research, higher levels of authenticity were significantly negatively correlated to posttraumatic stress symptoms, F(1,210) = 7.023, p {\textless} .01, and positively correlated to existential well-being, F(1,210) = 109.514, p {\textless} .001. These findings suggest an authentic worldview helps combat veterans achieve resiliency or posttraumatic growth in the face of their combat experiences leading to increased existential well-being. The understanding of these relationships can be used to influence pre-deployment training and post-deployment therapy models to increase resiliency and posttraumatic growth in combat veterans. Additional research is required to explore the possible causal relationships between these constructs and to investigate the specific worldview mechanisms mitigating posttraumatic stress.

1070,Cultural universals and differences in dealing with death - Denying death: An interdisciplinary approach to terror management theory.,"This chapter explores terror management theory and posits that one of the most important functions of human culture is to provide meanings and values that help people assuage the potential for anxiety that results from their awareness of the inevitability of death. From this perspective, the cultural meaning systems that contemporary humans use to derive security are the products of a long process of human innovation, debate, and revision that occurred gradually—and sometimes rapidly—over the course of human history as our ancestors became aware of death and used their sophisticated intellectual capacities to invent beliefs and values that helped them control their death-related fears. Although {TMT} addresses many other aspects of human behavior and experience, at its core, it is a theory of culture. It posits that although different groups of people, living in different times and places, developed different meaning systems, managing the potential for existential terror is a universal human need that all cultures must address, albeit sometimes in very different ways. This chapter will explore the commonalities and differences in the ways that cultures address the problem of death.

1071,"Executive Self, Self-Esteem, and Negative Affectivity: Relations at the Phenotypic and Genotypic Level","Complementary approaches examined the relations among executive self, self-esteem, and negative affectivity. A cross-sectional (N = 4,242) and a longitudinal (N = 158) study established that self-esteem mediated the relation between executive self and negative affectivity. A 3rd study (N = 878 twin pairs) replicated this pattern and examined genetic and environmental influences underlying all 3 phenotypes. Covariation among the 3 phenotypes reflected largely common genetic influences, although unique genetic effects explained variability in both executive self and negative affectivity. Executive self was influenced by shared environmental influences unique from those affecting self-esteem and negative affectivity. Nonshared environmental influences accounted for the majority of variance in each construct and were primarily unique to each. The unique genetic and nonshared environmental influences support the proposition that the executive self, self-esteem, and negative affectivity capture distinct and important differences between people.

1072,The surprising potency of implicit egotism: A reply to Simonsohn,"This article addresses Simonsohn's (2011) critique of field studies of implicit egotism. We argue that Simonsohn provides no compelling theoretical reason to believe that implicit egotism should be valid only in the laboratory. In addition, we argue that a careful analysis of most of Simonsohn's studies of implicit egotism shows that they provide little or no power to reveal real effects of implicit egotism. We conclude that it is more constructive to try to identify theoretically derived moderators of implicit egotism than to try to document that it is always spurious in the field.

New York, {NY}: Basic Books) attachment theory propose that when basic human emotional needs for affirmation, belongingness, and security are inadequately satisfied by early caregivers, the person internalizes problematic schemas and experiences difficulties with self-esteem regulation that subsequently obstruct the achievement of mature interdependence in adulthood. In an effort to explore these relationships, in the present study we probed whether particular selfobject needs and self-esteem-related experiences differentially predicted college students’ scores on each of 2 dimensions of adult attachment insecurity (anxiety, avoidance). There were 142 college students who completed measures of selfobject needs and adult attachment orientations along with measures of self-esteem instability, psychological entitlement, and self-compassion. Findings from simultaneous and hierarchical regression analyses indicated that distinct combinations of selfobject needs and self-esteem regulation experiences made unique contributions to each dimension of adult attachment insecurity.

1074,Existential neuroscience: Effects of mortality salience on the neurocognitive processing of attractive opposite-sex faces,"Being reminded of the inherently finite nature of human existence has been demonstrated to elicit strivings for sexual reproduction and the formation and maintenance of intimate relationships. Recently, it has been proposed that the perception of potential mating partners is influenced by mortality salience. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neurocognitive processing of attractive opposite-sex faces after priming with death-related words for heterosexual men and women. Significant modulations of behavioral and neural responses were found when participants were requested to decide whether they would like to meet the presented person. Men were more in favor of meeting attractive women after being primed with death-related words compared to a no-prime condition. Increased neural activation could be found under mortality salience in the left anterior insula and the adjacent lateral prefrontal cortex ({lPFC}) for both men and women. As previously suggested, we believe that the {lPFC} activation reflects an approach-motivated defense mechanism to overcome concerns that are induced by being reminded of death and dying. Our results provide insight on a neurocognitive level that approach motivation in general, and mating motivation in particular is modulated by mortality salience.

1075,Objectification as self-affirmation in the context of a death-relevant health threat,"Messages highlighting the risk of unhealthy behaviors threaten the self and can prompt a defensive response. From the perspective of self-affirmation theory, affirming an important value in a domain unrelated to the threat can reduce this defensiveness. Integrating terror management and objectification theory, this study examined objectification as a type of self-affirmation for women who highly value their appearance (i.e., high self-objectifiers) in the context of reactions towards a health message priming the association between breast cancer and death, and promoting the role of breast self-exams as an effective intervention. Self-objectification was found to moderate breast self-exam intentions and reactions to a {BSE} brochure when women were exposed to an objectifying image in the context of the death-relevant health threat. These findings show that for some women, objectification may provide the psychological fortitude necessary to actively confront threats to the self, and health, and may help to explain the pervasiveness of the phenomena.

1076,Mortal cognition: Viewing self and the world from the precipice - The Oxford handbook of social cognition.,"This chapter examines cognitive underpinnings of terror management theory ({TMT}) and research, and considers the implications of this work for understanding social cognition. The authors describe an associative network model of {TMT} and review evidence regarding spreading activation from death thought to worldview constructs and from stimuli associated with violence and health to death thought. The {TMT} dual defense model and evidence are summarized, with a focus on health-relevant behavior. Proximal defenses involve suppression of conscious death thought and rationalizations to minimize perceived vulnerability to death. Distal defenses are triggered by the heightened unconscious accessibility of death thought and bolster life's meaning and the self's value, thereby making death thought less likely to become conscious. The authors describe research on implications of {TMT} for understanding why and how people maintain well-structured conceptions of themselves, other people, and social situations, and consider the moderating role of need for structure. Finally, the authors consider remaining questions regarding how thoughts of mortality affect social cognition.

1077,Terror management in response to contemporary political issues,"The present dissertation empirically examines the impact of death thoughts on intergroup relations; the findings are explained using Terror Management Theory ({TMT}). {TMT} proposes that when mortality is made salient (Mortality Salience Hypothesis, {MSH}) people are more likely to exhibit greater positive evaluations of their in-group; greater adherence to the values of their in-group. People have a tendency to do this because culture tends to confer self-esteem (i.e., immortality), which allegedly mitigates death anxiety. Therefore, while there is a general tendency for people to exhibit greater positive evaluations of their in-group in the face of death, people who are high in tolerance are hypothesized to show out-group favoritism or, at least, no bias; while people who are intolerant should show in-group favoritism. Three studies investigated these hypotheses. In Study 1, participants were asked to evaluate presidential candidates Obama and {McCain} after answering questions regarding their own death (i.e., mortality condition) or answering question about a university exam (i.e., control condition). Although the expected main effect of mortality salience on in-group favoritism was not significant, participants high in openness exhibited out-group favoritism. Study 2 examined these processes by having participants evaluate a pro and an anti-gay marriage author following a reminder of their own mortality or an exam. Beyond a significant main effect for in-group favoritism, participants low in openness exhibited the Terror Management effect. The third study examined the {MSH} after participants watched a movie entitled The Final Destination (i.e., 'mortality condition') or another movie (i.e., 'control condition'). They then evaluated a pro and an anti-gay marriage author. Beyond an expected significant relationship between the type of movie watched and positive evaluations, participants high in similarity to the author who supported their view exhibited what the {MSH} would predict — greater positive in-group evaluations. Those low in similarity exhibited the reverse of this effect. Assuming that one's similarity rating for a culture is based on the extent the culture either upholds or challenges one's identity, it would make sense — according to the {MSH} — for these effects to manifest. Limitations of these studies and their relevance to Terror Management Theory are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Kinon, Marc D.",1,,1076
1078,The politics of mortal terror,"Terror-management theory is used to examine how political preferences are altered when existential concerns are aroused. The theory posits that the uniquely human awareness of death engenders potentially debilitating terror that is managed through devotion to cultural worldviews that give individuals a sense that life has meaning and that they have value. Research shows that mortality salience increases adherence to cherished cultural values and instigates efforts to bolster self-esteem. Here we review research documenting the role of terror-management processes in promoting support for charismatic leaders who share one’s cherished beliefs and aggression against those who hold rival beliefs. Implications for fostering effective participatory democracy are considered. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Cohen, Florette and Solomon, Sheldon",0,,1077
1079,Heartwarming memories: Nostalgia maintains physiological comfort,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 12(4) of Emotion (see record [rid]2012-15305-001[/rid]). The last sentence was incorrect. It should read: 'Such lines of inquiry may further establish nostalgia as a remarkable adaptation built on the human capacities to think temporally and self-reflectively (Routledge \& Arndt, 2005; Sedikides, Skowronski, \& Dunbar, 2006), an adaptation that provides an exquisite mechanism to anchor the organism in prior felicitous states.'] Nostalgia, a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, is a predominantly positive and social emotion. Recent evidence suggests that nostalgia maintains psychological comfort. Here, we propose, and document in five methodologically diverse studies, a broader homeostatic function for nostalgia that also encompasses the maintenance of physiological comfort. We show that nostalgia—an emotion with a strong connotation of warmth—is triggered by coldness. Participants reported stronger nostalgia on colder (vs. warmer) days and in a cold (vs. neutral or warm) room. Nostalgia, in turn, modulates the interoceptive feeling of temperature. Higher levels of music-evoked nostalgia predicted increased physical warmth, and participants who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary autobiographical) event perceived ambient temperature as higher. Finally, and consistent with the close central nervous system integration of temperature and pain sensations, participants who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary autobiographical) event evinced greater tolerance to noxious cold.

This research suggests that terror management theory could explain a number of decision-making behaviors in entrepreneurs. The central proposition of the current study is that entrepreneurs will respond similarly to firm failure salience as to mortality salience, and will, thereby, make more risk-averse decisions. The second proposition will explore whether the moderating effect of self-esteem between mortality salience and culture worldview posited by terror management theory is in accord with entrepreneurial self-efficacy as a moderator in the relationship between firm failure salience and risk-averse attitudes' ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Kinnamon, Eric",0,,1080

In both studies, mortality salience intensified the moral differences between liberals and conservatives.

1084,"Where, O death, is thy sting? The meaning-providing function of beliefs in literal immortality","Terror management theory suggests that humans invest in cultural worldviews that allay mortality-related anxiety by promising death transcendence. Many religious individuals adhere to belief in literal immortality—believing that one will live on after death. Across two studies (n = 1137), we explored the terror management function of such beliefs by exploring whether these beliefs are associated with lower death anxiety and greater meaning among individuals of varying religiousness. In both Study 1 (n = 236) and Study 2 (n = 901), belief in literal immortality was related to lower death anxiety only among intrinsically religious participants. Moreover, meaning in life mediated the relationship between belief in literal immortality and death anxiety. Study 2 clarified that this mediational relationship was only present for intrinsically religious individuals. We discuss the importance of particular religious beliefs in the provision of meaning in order to manage existential concerns.

Although ample research has explored cognitive styles that confer vulnerability to depression, cognitive styles that confer vulnerability to anxiety have received considerably less attention. In the present investigation, we examined the looming maladaptive style ({LMS}) as a cognitive style that functions as a danger schema to produce specific vulnerability to anxiety, but not to depression. In 4 studies, we examined the psychometric properties of a revised measure of the {LMS}, its predictive utility, and its effects on threat-related schematic processing. Results provided evidence for the validity of the {LMS} and indicated that it predicts anxiety and schematic processing of threat over and above the effects of other cognitive appraisals of threat, even in individuals who are currently nonanxious.

1086,Inclusion-exclusion of positive and negative past selves: Mood congruence as information,"The current research challenges the widespread truism that recalling a positive self necessarily increases self-esteem, whereas recalling a negative self necessarily decreases self-esteem. Four experiments demonstrate that chronically happy people show a relative increase in self-esteem by recalling either a positive or a negative self. Chronically sad people, however, show a relative decrease in self-esteem by recalling either a positive or a negative self. These effects are due to divergent perceptions of mood congruence between the recalled self and the current self. Specifically, happy people perceive high mood congruence between a recalled positive self and the current self but low mood congruence between a recalled negative self and the current self. In contrast, sad people perceive high mood congruence between a recalled negative self and the current self but low mood congruence between a recalled positive self and the current self. Independent of chronic mood, mood congruence leads to perceptions of temporal recency, whereas mood incongruence leads to perceptions of temporal distance. In line with the inclusion-exclusion model of social judgment, perceived temporal recency elicits assimilation effects on self-esteem, whereas perceived temporal distance elicits contrast effects on self-esteem.

1087,"Self-esteem reactions to social interactions: Evidence for sociometer mechanisms across days, people, and nations","People have a fundamental need to belong that motivates them to seek out social interactions with close others (Baumeister \& Leary, 1995). Leary and Baumeister's (2000) sociometer theory ({SMT}) poses that people who succeed in satisfying this need have higher self-esteem ({SE}). This prediction was tested across three hierarchical levels: intraindividual, interindividual, and international. Indicators of social interaction quantity, quality, and the interaction between quality and quantity were collected for relationships with friends, family members, and romantic partners. On the intraindividual level, relationship quality and the interaction between quantity and quality emerged as significant predictors of daily fluctuations in {SE}. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that this association is at least partly due to the effect of social inclusion on changes in {SE}. On an interindividual level, people who generally reported higher quality relationships also had higher levels of trait {SE}. On an international level, countries whose inhabitants regularly interact with friends were characterized by higher nationwide {SE} levels than countries without such practices, even when happiness, individualism, gross domestic product, and neuroticism were controlled.

In 4 studies with political and economic decision-making scenarios, it was consistently found that individuals with depleted self-regulation resources exhibited a stronger tendency for confirmatory information processing than did individuals with nondepleted self-regulation resources. Alternative explanations based on processes of ego threat, cognitive load, and mood were ruled out. Mediational analyses suggested that individuals with depleted self-regulation resources experienced increased levels of commitment to their own standpoint, which resulted in increased confirmatory information processing. In sum, the impact of ego depletion on confirmatory information search seems to be more motivational than cognitive in nature.

This accessibility was measured in a lexical decision task and a Stroop task following threat- or neutral-word primes, and was compared with the accessibility of representations of other close persons, known but not close persons, and unknown persons. Participants also reported on their attachment style. Threat primes led to increased accessibility of representations of attachment figures. This effect was specific to attachment figures and was replicated across tasks and experiments. Attachment anxiety heightened accessibility of representations of attachment figures even in neutral contexts, whereas attachment avoidance inhibited this activation when the threat prime was the word separation. These effects were not explained by trait anxiety. The discussion focuses on the dynamics of attachment-system activation in adulthood.

1092,Smoke your troubles away: Exploring the effects of death cognitions on cannabis craving and consumption,"Two studies informed by the terror management health model were conducted to examine the question of how death cognition affects cannabis craving and whether actual cannabis smoking alleviates death cognitions. The first study examined whether priming thoughts of death are associated with subjective cannabis craving among 42 frequent cannabis users randomly assigned to either a mortality salience or control task. When reminded of their death, participants craved cannabis, even though there was no change in their conscious negative mood. The second study examined the effect of cannabis smoking on death cognitions in an exploratory field setting. Fifty frequent cannabis users were randomly assigned to either mortality reminders or control task and completed death-related words accessibility measures before and after smoking cannabis. Results indicate that cannabis served as a buffer and prevented death-related thoughts from entering consciousness, thus acting as a defense mechanism against death anxiety. These findings indicate that death-related concerns may play a hitherto unsuspected role in cannabis craving and consumption. Also discussed are the implications of a terror management perspective in communication of negative health consequences of recreational cannabis smoking and in the use of cannabis for medical purposes among people with terminal illness.

Findings from 2 experiments corroborate the prediction that reactions to voice as opposed to no-voice procedures are affected more strongly when people are included in a group than when they are excluded from a group. These findings are extended with a 3rd experiment that shows that people who generally experience higher levels of inclusion in their lives respond more strongly to voice as opposed to no-voice procedures.

1095,Terror management after a recent suicide attempt,"Suicide is a controversial phenomenon that people of different cultures and even of different epochs have had difficulty naming. It used to be an enduring theme of many medical, psychological, philosophical, and moralistic discussions. It is a paradoxical act of ultimate self-destruction, a flight from life to death. To commit suicide is to overcome the fear of personal death and to make a step into nothingness. Such a desperately brave deed requires an abandonment of one’s sense of immortality, which we all have, a change of values and worldviews. But if one’s suicide attempt proves unsuccessful, the question becomes how to explain to oneself and others one’s recent act of self-violence. To discover these explanations, we conducted a study of 319 people, ranging in age from 18 to 25; they were all either students (n = 156) or patients in an emergency toxicology ward (people who had attempted to poison themselves, n = 163). This article summarizes theories of suicidal behavior and of the fear of death together with the ideas of cultural anthropologist E. Becker on these matters and puts suicide into the terror-management perspective. The suicidal act is viewed as a mortality salience, and the hypothesis is that people who deny their recent suicide attempt (n = 33) and who have one (n = 95) or several (n = 35) suicide attempts in their personal history exhibit different terror-management patterns in comparison with each other and with the control group. They fall back on different resources with various degrees of effectiveness. Implications of these results for understanding suicidal and postsuicidal behavior are discussed and suggestions for rehabilitation are made.

1096,Existential neuroscience: Self-esteem moderates neuronal responses to mortality-related stimuli,"According to terror management theory, self-esteem serves as a buffer against existential anxiety. This proposition is well supported empirically, but its neuronal underpinnings are poorly understood. Therefore, in the present neuroimaging study, our aim was to test how self-esteem affects our neural circuitry activation when death-related material is processed. Consistent with previous findings, the bilateral insula responded less to death-related stimuli relative to similarly unpleasant, but death-unrelated sentences, an effect that might reflect a decrease in the sense of oneself in the face of existential threat. In anterior parts of the insula, this 'deactivation' effect was more pronounced for high self-esteem individuals, suggesting that the insula might be of core importance to understanding the anxiety-buffering effect of self-esteem. In addition, low self-esteem participants responded with enhanced activation to death-related over unpleasant stimuli in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that regulating death-related thoughts might be more effortful to these individuals. Together, this suggests that the anxiety-buffering effect of self-esteem might be implemented in the brain in the form of both insula-dependent awareness mechanisms and prefrontal cortex-dependent regulation mechanisms.

1097,"Testing alternative explanations for mortality salience effects: Terror management, value accessibility, or worrisome thoughts?","Tested alternative explanations to terror management theory for mortality salience effects in 3 experiments with 144 undergraduates. Study 1 assessed the plausibility of an alternative explanation, which posits that mortality salience simply primes individuals' values. Studies 2 and 3 assessed the possibility that reminding Ss of any worrisome future concern would produce the same effect as a reminder of mortality. In both studies, mortality salience led to negative reactions to a deviant and had no effect on self-reported affect, whereas other worrisome thoughts had no effect on reactions to a deviant but did create negative affect. Consistent with terror management theory, mortality salience effects seem to result exclusively from thoughts of death.

1098,The psychological effects of terrorism are moderated by cultural worldviews,"Terrorism cannot be easily studied experimentally for obvious reasons. We report the results of a laboratory study (N = 149) testing the effect of cultural worldviews on feelings of threat and hostility toward Muslims in France that include in the design the deadly terrorist attack of January 7th 2015 in Paris as a naturally occurring independent variable. The results replicate past research by showing that in a natural context, people felt more threatened and more hostile toward Muslims after the terrorist attack than before. However, the reverse occurred in an experimental condition that made the French cultural worldview of colorblind equality salient: People felt less threatened and less hostile after the terrorist attack than before. These results provide, for the first time in the context of a real terrorist attack, support for Terror Management Theory’s proposal that cultural worldviews are an effective buffer against terror.

Correlates of self-efficacy, the emotional state delight, trait self-esteem, and sensory-motor skills were also inspected. Self-report measures were obtained from 29 athletes before an Artistic Roller Skating World Championship competition. Successful skaters who won a medal at this competition reported a higher level of self-efficacy before competition compared to skaters who did not. Compared to artistic roller skaters with low self-efficacy ratings, those with high self-efficacy ratings reported more delight, higher self-esteem, and more body-care before competition.

In Study 1, 500 participants completed self-report scales of attachment orientations and sexual experience. The findings indicated that whereas attachment anxiety was associated with an ambivalent construal of sexual experience, attachment avoidance was associated with more aversive sexual feelings and cognitions. In Study 2, 41 couples reported on their attachment orientations and provided daily diary measures of sexual experiences and relationship interactions for a period of 42 days. Results showed that attachment anxiety amplified the effects of positive and negative sexual experiences on relationship interactions. In contrast, attachment avoidance inhibited the positive relational effect of having sex and the detrimental relational effects of negative sexual interactions. The authors discuss the possibility that attachment orientations are associated with different sex-related strategies and goals within romantic relationships.

1101,The phenomenon of suicide bombing: A review of psychological and nonpsychological factors,"This article reviews the literature on the phenomenon of suicide bombing. It addresses the question of just how much a psychological understanding of the individuals involved can aid in prevention. The article looks at historical, epidemiological, and cultural perspectives and compares the nonpsychological and psychological approaches to suicide bombing. On the basis of the material available it seems that social processes such as group-dynamic indoctrination and political factors are decisive in analyzing this problem. Cultural, nationalistic, and religious factors are important. The conclusion is that in suicidal bombing, suicide is instrumental in the context of war, not in the context of psychopathology. Suicide bombing is instrumental in realizing fatalities, and it is only one of many weapons. The act of killing in warfare is more important to understanding suicidal terrorism than the act of suicide. This explains why psychological profiling of suicidal terrorists has to date not been successful.

In Studies 1-2, participants completed scales on group-related cognitions and emotions. In Studies 3-4, participants were divided into small groups, and their performance in group tasks as well as the cohesion of their group were assessed. Both attachment anxiety and avoidance in close relationships were associated with negative group-related cognitions and emotions. Anxiety was also related to the pursuit of closeness goals and impaired instrumental performance in group tasks. Avoidance was related to the pursuit of distance goals and deficits in socioemotional and instrumental performance. Group cohesion significantly moderated the effects of attachment anxiety. The discussion emphasizes the relevance of attachment theory within group contexts. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Rom, Eldad and Mikulincer, Mario",0,,1101
1103,A conceptual analysis of ageism,"Presently the research on ageism is marked by numerous more or less diffuse definitions of the concept of ageism. Many studies investigate both the causes and consequences of ageism without a clear definition of the phenomenon. As a consequence the area is characterized by diverging research results which are hard to re-test and to compare. It is therefore difficult to obtain a framework on ageism. This article offers a conceptual clarification of ageism. Based on a review of the existing literature, a new definition of ageism is introduced. This definition is more explicit and complex than previous definitions. This has two purposes. Firstly, its clarity constitutes the foundation for higher reliability and validity in future research about ageism. Secondly, its complexity offers a new way of systemizing theories on ageism.

1104,Negativity bias in attribution of external agency,"This research investigated whether people are more likely to attribute events to external agents when events are negative rather than neutral or positive. Participants more often believed that ultimatum game partners were humans rather than computers when the partners offered unusually unfavorable divisions than unusually favorable divisions (Experiment 1A), even when their human partners had no financial stake in the game (Experiment 1B). In subsequent experiments, participants were most likely to infer that gambles were influenced by an impartial participant when the outcomes of those gambles were losses rather than wins (Experiments 2 and 3), despite their explicitly equal probability. The results suggest a negative agency bias—negative events are more often attributed to the influence of external agents than similarly positive and neutral events, independent of their subjective probability.

Study 1 showed that the effects of events on participants' state of self-esteem paralleled their assumptions about whether such events would lead others to accept or reject them. In Study 2, participants' ratings of how included they felt in a real social situation correlated highly with their self-esteem feelings. In Studies 3 and 4, social exclusion caused decreases in self-esteem when respondents were excluded from a group for personal reasons, but not when exclusion was random, but this effect was not mediated by self-presentation. Study 5 showed that trait self-esteem correlated highly with the degree to which respondents generally felt included versus excluded by other people. Overall, results provided converging evidence for the sociometer model.

1106,"Hypomanic vulnerability, terror management, and materialism","Studies of terror management have suggested that people demonstrate increased acceptance of cultural values when made aware of their own inevitable death. Recently, Kasser and Sheldon (2000) found that materialism, one value within capitalistic cultures, increased more after a mortality salience manipulation than after a control condition. Self-esteem protection is believed to be a central mechanism in terror management effects. A separate theory has suggested that mania is related to fragile self-esteem and defensive reactions to threat. In this study, we draw on terror management as a lens into self-esteem and reactions to threat among students who are vulnerable to hypomanic symptoms. Students (N = 225) completed self-report questionnaires, including the Hypomanic Personality Scale ({HPS}), and then were randomly assigned to write about death (mortality salience condition) or music (control condition). Then, students completed measures of materialism. As predicted, a significant interaction between hypomania and experimental condition was documented, in that individuals who were vulnerable to hypomania demonstrated greater materialism after the mortality salience manipulation compared to those with low vulnerability.

Moreover, an important {TMT} variable—self-esteem—was used as a moderator. A 2 × 3 between-subjects factorial design crossed smoking-based self-esteem (low, high) with mortality salience manipulation (health-focused, social-focused, control). Results suggest while both making health-focused salient and making social-focused mortality salient were effective at getting smokers to quit, there was less effect for health-focused mortality salience on those whose self-esteem is strongly tied to smoking. Effect of social-focused mortality salience was more pronounced among participants who highly linked self-esteem with smoking. For smokers with low smoking-based self-esteem, both health-focused and social-focused mortality salience were effective at motivating attitude change toward smoking and quitting intentions. Implications for smoking cessation ad design and {TMT} are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Wong, Norman C.

1108,Distinct effects of reminding mortality and physical pain on the default-mode activity and activity underlying self-reflection,"Behavioral research suggests that reminding both mortality and negative affect influences self-related thoughts. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), we tested the hypothesis that reminders of mortality and physical pain decrease brain activity underlying self-related thoughts. Three groups of adults underwent priming procedures during which they answered questions pertaining to mortality, physical pain, or leisure time, respectively. Before and after priming, participants performed personality trait judgments on oneself or a celebrity, identified the font of words, or passively viewed a fixation. The default-mode activity and neural activity underlying self-reflection were identified by contrasting viewing a fixation vs. font judgment and trait judgments on oneself vs. a celebrity, respectively. The analyses of the pre-priming functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data identified the default-mode activity in the posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}), ventral medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}), and parahippocampal gyrus, and the activity underlying instructed self-reflection in both the ventral and dorsal regions of the {MPFC}. The analyses of the post-priming {fMRI} data revealed that, relative to leisure time priming, reminding mortality significantly reduced the default-mode {PCC} activity, and reminding physical pain significantly decreased the dorsal {MPFC} activity during instructed self-reflection. Our findings suggest distinct neural underpinnings of the effect of reminding morality and aversive emotion on default-mode and instructed self-reflection.

1109,The anxiety-buffering properties of cultural and subcultural worldviews: Terror management processes among juvenile delinquents,"Terror management research indicates that people reminded of mortality strongly affirm values and standards consistent with their cultural worldview and distance themselves from values and standards inconsistent with it. However, limited research has addressed how individuals holding beliefs inconsistent with the dominant worldview cope with death-related anxiety. The present article aims to determine which worldview subcultural groups rely on when reminded of mortality: mainstream or subcultural? Juvenile delinquents living in residential reformatories in Poland were invited to participate in a terror management study examining the anxiety-buffering strategies of individuals belonging to a group largely outside mainstream culture. Following reminders of mortality, juvenile delinquents increased support for values consistent with the mainstream cultural worldview and decreased support for values consistent with the subcultural worldview, as compared to control conditions. The present results suggest that when faced with existential threat, the subcultural worldview does not provide an adequate anxiety buffer, leading members of this subcultural group to display increased identification with mainstream cultural values. Additionally, participants’ state anxiety following death reminders was mediated by mainstream cultural worldview defense.

1111,The cycle of righteous destruction: A Terror Management Theory perspective on terrorist and counter-terrorist violence - Terrorism and torture: An interdisciplinary perspective.,"Although it has often been said that violence begets violence, policy decisions rarely seem to reflect this ancient wisdom. Today's turbulent world of terrorism and counter-terrorism is certainly no exception, with violence being the tool of choice for all sides, and seemingly little regard for human life. This chapter discusses the psychological processes that lead terrorist groups and nations fighting against such groups to support violent solutions to their problems that entail the killing of multitudes of innocent people. By considering the psychological, social, and political forces that operate on both terrorist and counter-terrorist movements, we hope to avoid the infinite regress of blame that usually characterizes such discussions. We begin with a difficult but pivotal question: how can a human being justify the premeditated murder of innocent men, women, and children? To understand the chaotic interchange of 'justified' violence begetting further 'justified' violence, we will explore the vicious cycle of violence and counter-violence that creates feelings of humiliation and injustice on both sides of a conflict, which typically incites rather than quells hostility. We will use Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) (Greenberg et al, 1986), an empirically based psychological theory about the psychological functions of culture and self-esteem, to explain why violence and the symbolic threat of humiliation and injustice result in a self-perpetuating cycle of violence that is rooted in attempts on both sides to restore a sense of personal and collective value stemming from faith in the supremacy of one's worldview. From the perspective of {TMT}, terrorist violence, whether in the name of nationalism, ethnic purity, political ideology, or religious beliefs, is as much a symbolic act of defiance and defense as it is a concrete act of destruction. This knowledge can help us understand the failure of violent counter-terrorist policies and guide us in our search for solutions that promote peace rather than perpetuate violence.

1112,Individual and collective processes in the construction of the self: Self-enhancement in the United States and self-criticism in Japan,"A collective constructionist theory of the self proposes that many psychological processes, including enhancement of the self (pervasive in the United States) and criticism and subsequent improvement of the self (widespread in Japan), result from and support the very ways in which social acts and situations are collectively defined and subjectively experienced in the respective cultural contexts. In support of the theory, 2 studies showed, first, that American situations are relatively conducive to self-enhancement and American people are relatively likely to engage in self-enhancement and, second, that Japanese situations are relatively conducive to self-criticism and Japanese people are relatively likely to engage in self-criticism. Implications are discussed for the collective construction of psychological processes implicated in the self and, more generally, for the mutual constitution of culture and the self.

1113,Why Susie sells seashells by the seashore: Implicit egotism and major life decisions,"Because most people possess positive associations about themselves, most people prefer things that are connected to the self (e.g., the letters in one's name). The authors refer to such preferences as implicit egotism. Ten studies assessed the role of implicit egotism in 2 major life decisions: where people choose to live and what people choose to do for a living. Studies 1-5 showed that people are disproportionately likely to live in places whose names resemble their own first or last names (e.g., people named Louis are disproportionately likely to live in St. Louis). Study 6 extended this finding to birthday number preferences. People were disproportionately likely to live in cities whose names began with their birthday numbers (e.g., Two Harbors, {MN}). Studies 7-10 suggested that people disproportionately choose careers whose labels resemble their names (e.g., people named Dennis or Denise are overrepresented among dentists). Implicit egotism appears to influence major life decisions. This idea stands in sharp contrast to many models of rational choice and attests to the importance of understanding implicit beliefs.

1114,"You are alive right now: An experimental exploration of the interplay between existential salience, mental health, and death anxiety","Terror management theory ({TMT}) places death anxiety in an explanatory role in cognition, affect, and behavior, spanning mental health to cultural trends. We aimed to connect {TMT} to trait death anxiety, and propose an additional component: life acknowledgement (life awareness, lived experience connection, liveliness engagement) which yields vitality salience when conscious. Participants (n = 156) were randomized to mortality, neutral, or vitality salience conditions, and completed assessments of self-esteem, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety (death and dying separately). Results indicated that death anxiety was independent of demographic factors; that death anxiety was correlated with generalized anxiety (r = .18 and r = .32) and self-esteem (r = -.35 and r = -.38); and that salience groups did not differ on the outcome measures. We concluded that existential salience priming operates separately from trait self-report. Findings supported trends in current literature, and prompted further questions regarding {TMT} and vitality salience.

However, when the sample was divided into ‘raised religious’ and ‘raised secular’ groups, believers who were not raised in the Christian faith and converted to Christianity as adults were more likely to use culturally rather than religiously based world views defence strategies when exposed to reminders of death than were the ‘raised religious’ group.

In the present study, we demonstrated that Japanese individuals who are high on interdependent {SC} indeed show greater tolerance toward worldview-threatening other in the {MS} (vs control) condition, thus replicating the prior research. Extending this research, we also found that interdependent people’s tolerance toward worldview-threatening other was mediated by increased activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the {MS} condition. These data suggested that when exposed to death-related stimuli, highly interdependent individuals may spontaneously activate their neural self-control system which may serve to increase tolerance toward others.

1117,Identity and death threats: An investigation of social identity and terror management processes in online news,"When people experience reminders of their mortality, anxiety heightens. This, in turn, can increase worldview defenses such as outgroup derogation. In this experiment, White participants (N = 190) read an online news story that presented a death threat (death threat, non-death threat) and identity threat (White threat, Black threat, race-neutral threat) manipulation. Following exposure to the experimental manipulation, participants completed measures of anxiety, specific self-esteem, and worldview defense. A multicategorical moderation supported the integration of specific self-esteem in social identity processes. The findings from moderated mediation analyses support previous terror management research (Greenberg et al., 1997): When exposure to a death threat has not been sufficiently suppressed, anxiety from the threat can manifest in worldview defenses. Results demonstrate that specific self-esteem buffers anxiety elicited from threats unrelated to racial identity. Implications include identity processes by which the effects of threat can be mitigated. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Vang-Corne, Mao Houamoua",1,,1116
1118,Tattoo passing and self-esteem: A terror management perspective,"According to Terror Management Theory, modifying the body in any way, including with tattoos, can create a sense of belonging that increases self-esteem. However, because tattoos are stigmatized by the mainstream culture, the self-esteem of individuals with tattoos may be reduced. Individuals often cover (i.e., pass) their tattoos to appear as a member of the mainstream culture by dissociating from tattoo stigmas, but passing has negative consequences. This quantitative, quasi-experimental design sought to understand the relationship between tattoo passing and self-esteem by exploring how self-esteem varied in individuals with varied level of tattoo visibility. Owners of tattoo-related websites and blogs posted the survey link and their readers responded. Participants completed Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale and two tattoo visibility questions. Based upon their responses, participants (N = 1052) were assigned to one of four groups: high tattoo visibility (n = 146, 14\%), moderate tattoo visibility (n = 454, 43\%), low tattoo visibility (n = 198, 19\%), or no tattoos (n = 254, 24\%). A one-way {ANOVA} was conducted to compare the means of self-esteem scores for no tattoos (M = 22.23, {SD} = 5.71), low visibility (M = 23.85, {SD} = 5.13), moderate visibility (M = 23.46, {SD} = 5.27), and high visibility (M = 24.17, {SD} = 5.35) and showed a main effect of tattoo visibility on self-esteem scores, F(3, 1048) = 5.46, p = .001, ?2 = .02. Because the findings from this study showed differences in self-esteem of individuals with tattoos and those without tattoos, there is much to be understood about the relationship between tattoo visibility and self-esteem. Future studies can further explore the impact of voluntary and required passing, the percentage of time an individual passes, and how these behaviors relate to self-esteem.

1120,"Understanding and treating scrupulosity - The Wiley handbook of obsessive compulsive disorders., Vol. 1-2.","This chapter discusses the phenomenology of scrupulosity, its diagnosis across cultures and religions, and the relationship between religion and obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}). It identifies exposure and response (ritual) prevention ({ERP}) as the fundamental treatment modality, and discusses how to address a number of unique challenges that arise in applying {ERP} for {OCD} to scrupulosity regarding how to distinguish religion from {OCD}, the therapeutic stance, communicating the treatment rationale and psychoeducation, involving and interacting effectively with clergy, implementing in vivo and imaginal exposures, and prayer. Abramowitz and Jacoby propose a cognitive-behavioral model of scrupulosity that stresses the significance of dysfiinctional and intrusive beliefs, the uncertain nature of many facets of religion, and the role of compulsive behaviors in the development and maintenance of scrupulosity. Some researchers have introduced an existential conceptualization of scrupulosity. According to terror management theory ({TMT}), religion is a means of coping with anxiety associated with fears of death and mortality. Scrupulous {OCD} can manifest in many religious aspects of life. Although nonreligious individuals can also suffer from scrupulosity, many of the issues discussed are more easily addressed with such patients.

The present research investigates whether mortality reminders motivate behavior linked with heroism, and whether such behavior functions to decrease thoughts of death. Findings indicate that after reminders of death and linking pain tolerance to heroism, participants reported less pain on a cold pressor task ({CPT}). Further, those reminded of death and given false-feedback indicating heroic performance on the {CPT}, i.e., significant levels of pain tolerance, had lower death thought accessibility. Findings are discussed as generative for heroism research, informing a motivation underlying heroic enactment, and also theoretically important for {TMT}, informing how heroism may promote attainment of cultural values even in the face of adversity.

1122,Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health,"Many prominent theorists have argued that accurate perceptions of the self, the world, and the future are essential for mental health. Yet considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought. Moreover, these illusions appear to promote other criteria of mental health, including the ability to care about others, the ability to be happy or contented, and the ability to engage in productive and creative work. These strategies may succeed, in large part, because both the social world and cognitive-processing mechanisms impose filters on incoming information that distort it in a positive direction; negative information may be isolated and represented in as unthreatening a manner as possible. These positive illusions may be especially useful when an individual receives negative feedback or is otherwise threatened and may be especially adaptive under these circumstances.

A 3rd experiment countered an alternative explanation of the results in terms of mood effects that may have accompanied the experimental manipulations. Results were discussed in terms of the following: (1) their support for a resources theory of individual differences in resilience to self-image threats—an extension of self-affirmation theory, (2) their implications for self-esteem functioning, and (3) their implications for the continuing debate over self-enhancement vs self-consistency motivation.

The present research used both explicit (questionnaire) and implicit (single-target implicit association test; property verification) measurement techniques to examine how thoughts of death influence, specifically, belief in religious supernatural agents. When primed with death, participants explicitly defended their own religious worldview, such that self-described Christians were more confident that supernatural religious entities exist, while non-religious participants were more confident that they do not. However, when belief was measured implicitly, death priming increased all participants' beliefs in religious supernatural entities, regardless of their prior religious commitments. The results are interpreted in terms of a dual-process model of religious cognition, which can be used to resolve conflicting prior data, as well as to help explain the perplexing durability of religious belief.

1126,Death of a salesman: Webpage-based manipulations of mortality salience,"Most people are accustomed to ignoring the advertisements that they encounter while surfing the Internet, despite the profound effects such advertisements can have on behavior. We showed that webpage advertisements can remind people of their mortality (Study 1) and lead them to invest in culturally valued behavior (Studies 2–4). Specifically, individuals in the 'mortality salience' condition reported greater worldview defense (Study 2) and spent more money on luxury items (Studies 3 and 4) than those in the control condition, consistent with proposals set forth by terror management theory. In Study 4, death-related thoughts mediated the relationship between mortality salience and willingness to spend money on luxury items.

1127,"Music-evoked nostalgia: Affect, memory, and personality","Participants listened to randomly selected excerpts of popular music and rated how nostalgic each song made them feel. Nostalgia was stronger to the extent that a song was autobiographically salient, arousing, familiar, and elicited a greater number of positive, negative, and mixed emotions. These effects were moderated by individual differences (nostalgia proneness, mood state, dimensions of the Affective Neurosciences Personality Scale, and factors of the Big Five Inventory). Nostalgia proneness predicted stronger nostalgic experiences, even after controlling for other individual difference measures. Nostalgia proneness was predicted by the Sadness dimension of the Affective Neurosciences Personality Scale and Neuroticism of the Big Five Inventory. Nostalgia was associated with both joy and sadness, whereas nonnostalgic and nonautobiographical experiences were associated with irritation.

In this study, we investigated whether the introduction of the Euro has affected how people made a financial investment decision. We found that thinking about investment alternatives using the Euro led to a more negative attitude toward this currency compared to people who were making a financial decision using the {DM}. In addition, we showed that people searched for more information regarding advantages of the investment alternatives than disadvantages when making an investment decision with the Euro compared to the {DM}.

The new measure was tested using a sample of 501 Iraqi refugees who are one of the most traumatized groups. The following six salient factors were found: collective identity, family, personal identity, interdependence or secondary, man-made or nature-made survival, and abandonment types of traumas. The study provided evidence of adequate reliability; construct, convergent, divergent and predictive validity of the new scale and provided partial confirmation of the validity of the development-based taxonomy of traumas. A new method was introduced to measure trauma types and profiles and their differential association with different symptom configurations and health disorders. The newly developed measure can be used in clinical trauma-informed settings and in research.

The experiment hereby quoted tests the influence of commitment (high vs. low) on an attempt of persuasive message for a forthcoming effect, that is, after reading an antialcohol message to subjects. The idea consists in inducing alcohol consumers toward modifying their attitude and behavioral intentions toward alcohol. As expected, the high committed drinkers (i.e., regular drinkers) resist persuasion (on the level of both attitude and intention). The low committed drinkers (i.e., occasional drinkers) do not resist persuasion but adopt further on a more favorable attitude toward alcohol. The drinkers who had read a strongly threatening, yet at the same time strongly reassuring, message express the strongest intention to reduce their alcohol consumption. Results are described with reference to Witte's (1998) extended parallel process model. A new perspective is presented at the end of our paper, that is, toward a 'committing communication.'

1131,Odyssey's end: Lay conceptions of nostalgia reflect its original homeric meaning,"Nostalgia fulfills pivotal functions for individuals, but lacks an empirically derived and comprehensive definition. We examined lay conceptions of nostalgia using a prototype approach. In Study 1, participants generated open-ended features of nostalgia, which were coded into categories. In Study 2, participants rated the centrality of these categories, which were subsequently classified as central (e.g., memories, relationships, happiness) or peripheral (e.g., daydreaming, regret, loneliness). Central (as compared with peripheral) features were more often recalled and falsely recognized (Study 3), were classified more quickly (Study 4), were judged to reflect more nostalgia in a vignette (Study 5), better characterized participants' own nostalgic (vs. ordinary) experiences (Study 6), and prompted higher levels of actual nostalgia and its intrapersonal benefits when used to trigger a personal memory, regardless of age (Study 7). These findings highlight that lay people view nostalgia as a self-relevant and social blended emotional and cognitive state, featuring a mixture of happiness and loss. The findings also aid understanding of nostalgia's functions and identify new methods for future research.

1132,Understanding the motivational consequences of extreme school violence through the lens of mortality salience: The case of academic self-stereotyping in math,"We conducted an investigation into a determinant of academic motivation that has implications for how we respond to school violence and tragedy. We conducted two studies to examine whether exposure to messages related to the salience of one's own mortality cause people to align their own academic beliefs more closely with stereotypical beliefs about their social groups. When exposed to graffiti images that contained messages such as R.I.P. (i.e., rest in peace), males and females in Study 1 expressed math attitudes that resembled the American stereotype of male superiority and female inferiority in this domain. In Study 2, writing about death caused participants to express ethnic stereotype-consistent math attitudes.As one example, our studies highlight a potential psychological barrier associated with student advancement in {STEM} careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). These findings indicate that death reminders, even when they do not follow from direct exposure to school trauma, may impact the academic motivation of stereotypically disadvantaged groups. With the larger goal of reducing psychological barriers associated with inequality in the pursuit of {STEM} career pathways, these studies are intended to spur further examination of how cases of extreme violence in schools potentially can affect patterns of academic motivation. Even in its early stages, this research should provide new considerations for educational policy-makers aiming to design damage control protocols in response to extreme school violence.

1133,Who uses groups to transcend the limits of the individual self? Exploring the effects of interdependent self-construal and mortality salience on investment in social groups,"Terror management theory posits that people identify with and invest in culturally derived social groups, in part, to attach the self to something more permanent than one’s physical existence. Accordingly, research demonstrates that reminders of mortality (mortality salience) increase investment in culturally derived in-groups. The current research extends this analysis by examining whether amplified in-group investment following mortality salience is primarily characteristic of people who define the self in terms of social groups (interdependent self-construal). Three studies provided support for this assertion. Mortality salience increased: identification with one’s nation among Chinese (high interdependence culture) but not American (low interdependence culture) participants (Study 1); positivity toward one’s university for students with high, but not low, interdependent self-construal (Study 2); and willingness to self-sacrifice for one’s religious group among participants induced to adopt an interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal (Study 3).

Behavioral psychologists have examined what happens when people approach a threat cognitively and affectively resulting in explicit anxiety. Psychoanalysts have studied ways in which people avoid anxiety cognitively or affectively, resulting in implicit anxiety. Effective treatments for both involve helping the client relax and approach the threatening experience. An emerging model is described in which self-organizing processes represent modifications in the perspectives of both psychoanalytic and behavioral orientations. This model of conscious processes with decreasing degrees of awareness has some thoughts, feelings, and images in focal awareness, others on the periphery, and still others not in awareness.

1135,How are temporal and social comparisons related to appraisals of self-rated health during very old age?,"This study investigated the direction of effects of temporal and downward social comparisons on self-rated health in very old age. Conversely, self-rated health can either reinforce or hinder comparison processes. In the framework of the Swiss Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on the Oldest Old, individuals aged 80 to 84 at baseline were interviewed and followed longitudinally for 5 years. Multilevel analyses were used to test the relative importance of temporal and social comparisons on self-rated health evaluations synchronically and diachronically (with a time lag of 12 to 18 months) as well as the direction of these relative influences. Results indicate that (a) at the synchronic level, continuity temporal comparisons have more impact than downward social comparisons on self-rated health; (b) both types of comparison had an independent and positive effect on self-rated health at the diachronic level; (c) self-rated health has an independent synchronic effect on both types of comparison and an independent diachronic effect in temporal comparison.

1136,Perceived collective continuity and ingroup identification as defence against death awareness,"Perhaps unique among the animal species, humans are aware that they will ultimately die. Terror management theory ({TMT}) posits that investing in a social group helps people to manage paralysing anxiety stemming from death awareness. In line with this proposition, research to date has shown that when reminded of their own mortality, people increase their identification with a relevant group and defend its beliefs, values, and practices. In the reported study, we demonstrate that a mortality salience induction enhances people's perceptions of group temporal endurance-or perceived collective continuity ({PCC}), as we define it. Enhanced {PCC} leads, in turn, to enhanced group identification. This is in line with the {TMT} assumption that death awareness leads people to invest in a social group because this constitutes a temporally enduring meaning-system that imbues life with meaning, order, and permanence, and promises death transcendence to those who meet the prescribed standards of value.

Studies 1 and 2 examined the content of nostalgic experiences. Descriptions of nostalgic experiences typically featured the self as a protagonist in interactions with close others (e.g., friends) or in momentous events (e.g., weddings). Also, the descriptions contained more expressions of positive than negative affect and often depicted the redemption of negative life scenes by subsequent triumphs. Studies 3 and 4 examined triggers of nostalgia and revealed that nostalgia occurs in response to negative mood and the discrete affective state of loneliness. Studies 5, 6, and 7 investigated the functional utility of nostalgia and established that nostalgia bolsters social bonds, increases positive self-regard, and generates positive affect. These findings demarcate key landmarks in the hitherto uncharted research domain of nostalgia.

However, one important area has yet to receive attention: the workplace. For many employees, corporate culture is not only connected to earning a salary, but also to a sense of security and even personal transcendence. We present evidence that procompany judgments can serve as psychological defenses under existential threat. In Study 1, following mortality salience, employees gave a more favorable evaluation of the company-praising essay and a more negative evaluation of the critical one. In Study 2, employees and students at a German university were more likely to endorse aspects of organizational culture under mortality salience.

1139,Activism as a heroic quest for symbolic immortality: An existential perspective on collective action,"Excellent research exists on the conditions that generate political and social activism. Yet a central issue has remained perplexing: how does the personal need to stand out as unique and heroic interact with the concern for the positive image of the group, and the desire to protect and bolster its status, goals and shared values, in propelling collective action? Inspired by existential theory and research, this paper proposes an existential perspective on activism that identifies the human desire for a sense of meaning and significance as an important motivation underlying individuals' choice to engage in collective action. This study outlines an integrative model of collective action, combining insights from existential psychology with insights from the social identity perspective, to bridge together needs and concerns associated with both personal identity and group identity into a single model of collective action through the concept of death-anxiety buffering mechanisms. This model suggests that collective action is an effective means to satisfy existential needs through bolstering and protecting group interests and values on the one hand, and realizing the activist's heroism project on the other. Suggestions for future research are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Elad-Strenger, Julia",0,,1138
1140,Mortality salience increases death-anxiety for individuals low in personal need for structure,"Research derived from terror management theory suggests that death cognition does not lead to death-anxiety because people respond to thoughts of death by turning to social and cultural structures that provide a sense of psychological security. However, recent research indicates that it is people high, but not low, in personal need for structure that turn to social and cultural structures in response to heightened death cognition. Such findings suggest that people low in {PNS} may be vulnerable to experiencing death-anxiety when death thoughts are activated. The current study explored this possibility. Individual differences in personal need for structure were measured and death cognition (mortality salience) was manipulated. Subsequently, death-anxiety was assessed. Mortality salience increased death-anxiety, but only among individuals low in personal need for structure.

1141,"Dysphoria, failure, and suicide: Level of depressive symptoms moderates effects of failure on implicit thoughts of suicide and death","Building on escape and terror management theories, we reasoned that after failure the desire to escape the self (as reflected in suicide-thought accessibility) would dominate among dysphoric students, while fear of death (as indexed by death-thought accessibility) would dominate among nondysphoric students. The present study (N = 82 college students) examined this hypothesis. As expected, dysphoric students showed greater accessibility of suicide-related thoughts than of death-related thoughts after failure to attain a high standard of intelligence. In contrast, in the same situation, nondysphoric students showed greater accessibility of death- related thoughts than of suicide-related thoughts. The results suggest that dysphoric individuals are particularly vulnerable to suicide-related thoughts after failure, indicating that desire to escape may surpass death anxiety in this context. These results offer a fine-grained analysis of the impact of failure on implicit thoughts of death and suicide and help to reconcile divergent findings in the literature.

1142,On shielding from death as an important yet malleable motive of worldview defense: Christian versus Muslim beliefs modulating the self-threat of mortality salience,"This article argues that shielding from death is an important yet malleable motive. In particular, on the basis of conceptual insights into the psychology of Christianity and Islam we propose that shielding from death fulfills a more important psychological function among Christians than among Muslims. In accordance with this line of reasoning four studies all indicate that reminders of death trigger especially strong reactions of worldview defense among Christians, and less so (sometimes even nonsignificant reactions) among Muslims. The findings of the fourth study suggest that this is the case because among Christians reminders of death pose a stronger threat to their sense of self than among Muslims. In this way, the current article reveals that religion modulates the self-threatening influence of mortality salience on worldview defense reactions. This insight may stimulate a new generation of worldview defense studies that focus on religious and cultural moderators of worldview defense and that do not assume one common mechanism of threat-compensation that should be applicable to each and every person in every situation.

1143,Towards an indigenous psychology of religious terrorism with global implications: Introduction to {AJSP}'s special issue on Islamist terrorism in Indonesia,"While Islamist forms of terrorism have received a great deal of attention from scholars, insider accounts by indigenous scholars are still under-represented. This Special Issue of the Asian Journal of Social Psychology brings together three articles on religious terrorism and sacred violence in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Islamic state. They bring together qualitative methods, including interviews with terrorist members of {KOMPAK} and Jemaah Islamiyah (including the Bali Bombers), with quantitative methods using structural equation modelling to explain a national representative sample’s attitudes towards sacred violence. The articles converge towards an indigenous theory of Islamist terrorism for Indonesia involving three steps: (i) existential threat (triggered by violence inflicted on Muslims, nationally or internationally, and perceptions of the impurity of the secular Indonesian government), (ii) self-categorization of the world into infidels and believers (thus arguing that the current situation is a state of war where violence against non-combatants is justified), and (iii) jihadi ideology as the trigger for turning existential threat into religious violence. It is the interpretation of scripture offered by trusted leaders, often reinforced by oaths of obedience, rather than scripture itself that fuels the indigenous psychology of violent (lesser) jihad presented here.

The author proposes several reasons for this oversight and introduces the communicative or strong adaptive approach to psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, which has recently begun to explore this issue. The features of the approach are described, with emphasis on a revised version of Freud's topographic model of the mind. Three forms of death anxiety are postulated: existential, predatory, and predator.

Study 1, an experimental study of negotiation, showed that fair interpersonal treatment led to a smaller egocentric bias, quicker settlements, and fewer stalemates. Study 2 showed that fair treatment was related to a smaller egocentric bias in a real-life context. University students were more willing to accept a higher tuition fee and less willing to cut the salary of their teachers if the interpersonal treatment received from the teachers was more positive. Study 3 showed experimentally that in support of fairness heuristic theory, when the fair interpersonal treatment received could be attributed externally, its attenuating effect on the egocentric bias disappeared.

This study tested these alternatives by examining social goals in response to blocked goals and foreshortened time. Findings reveal distinct motivational patterns, as reflected in social preferences and self-reported social goals, in response to the 2 types of constraints.

Two studies supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 31 people were interviewed in close proximity to a funeral home or several blocks away and were asked to indicate their attitudes toward 2 charities they deemed important. Those who were interviewed in front of the funeral home reported more favorability toward these charities than those who were interviewed several blocks away. Study 2 again tested whether mortality salience increased the desire to help, this time within participants' own culture. 22 participants were asked to think about their own death (mortality salience) or dental pain (aversive control topic). After several filler measures, participants were asked whether they would like to contribute to an American and an international charity. It was found that following mortality salience, people gave more money to a charity supporting an American cause than people who had been exposed to the avervive control topic. However, mortality salience had no effect on the amount of money given to a foreign cause. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

1150,The Traumatic Process: Conceptualization and Treatment,"Traumatic stress stems from a threat to an individual's or a group's very existence. The impact of the existential threat may be compounded by an inability to cope, which affects the perception of helplessness and loss of lawfulness. The traumatic process has three stages: Alert, Impact, and Post-Trauma. The common elements in the treatment of all stages of traumatic stress are the need to control and expand life and to achieve lawfulness and meaning/illness. In the preferred model of treatment, there are essential differences at each of the stages of the traumatic process: I) primary prevention at the stage of alert focuses on planning strategies for coping, 2) secondary prevention at the stage of impact derives from Salmon's Forward Treatment and S.L.A. Marshall's Debriefing; 3) tertiary treatment at the post-trauma stage attends to coping with internal chaos and arbitrariness.

1151,Diverging effects of mortality salience on variety seeking: The different roles of death anxiety and semantic concept activation,"Thoughts about one's death can not only induce death anxiety but also activate death-related semantic concepts. These effects of mortality salience have different implications for judgments and behavior. We demonstrate these differences in an investigation of variety-seeking behavior. Four experiments showed that the anxiety elicited by thinking about one's own death decreased the variety of participants' choices in an unrelated multiple-choice decision situation, whereas activating semantic concepts of death without inducing anxiety increased it. Moreover, inducing cognitive load decreased the anxiety-inducing effect of mortality salience, leading its concept-activation effect to predominate. The accessibility of death-related semantic concepts spontaneously induces a global processing style that increases the range of acceptable choice alternatives in a variety-seeking task, and this occurs regardless of how mortality salience is induced. However, the effect of inducing death anxiety, which is driven by a desire for stability, may override the effect of semantic concept activation when participants think about their own death.

Attraction research has suggested that a person likes individuals who are similar to his or her {IS}. Social comparison research has suggested that upward social comparison threatens self-evaluation. In Experiment 1, attraction to a partner increased and then decreased as the partner became more similar to and then surpassed the participant's {IS}. In Experiment 2, the cognitive and affective components of attraction increased and decreased, respectively, as the partner approached and surpassed the participant's {IS} to the extent that the dimension of comparison was meaningful and participants anticipated meeting their partner. Similarity to the {IS} generates opposing cognitive and affective reactions when the self-evaluative threat of upward comparison intensifies.

1153,Self-regulatory perseveration and the depressive self-focusing style: A self-awareness theory of reactive depression,"We apply theory and research on self-focused attention and self-regulatory processes to the problems of depression and use this framework to integrate the roles played by a variety of psychological processes emphasized by other theories of the development and maintenance of depression. We propose that depression occurs after the loss of an important source of self-worth when an individual becomes stuck in a self-regulatory cycle in which no responses to reduce the discrepancy between actual and desired states are available. Consequently, the individual falls into a pattern of virtually constant self-focus, resulting in intensified negative affect, self-derogation, further negative outcomes, and a depressive self-focusing style. Eventually, these factors lead to a negative self-image, which may take on value by providing an explanation for the individual's plight and by helping the individual avoid further disappointments. The depressive self-focusing style then maintains and exacerbates the depressive disorder. We review findings from laboratory studies of mild to moderately depressed people, correlational studies of more severely depressed people, and clinical observations with respect to consistency with the theory.

How does this knowledge influence meaning in life and is influenced by it? Four studies examined the association between meaning in life and awareness of death, through a Terror Management Theory perspective. Study 1 assessed the effects of a mortality reminder on self-reports of meaning in life, while exploring the moderating role of self-esteem. The findings indicate a trend in which after a mortality salience induction, high self-esteem individuals tend to view their lives as more meaningful. Studies 2 and 3 examined the effect of thinking about the meaning of life on death-thought accessibility, and found it to be higher in both the mortality and meaning salience conditions, as compared to a control condition. Study 4 sought to discover whether reminders of one’s meaning in life would yield cultural worldview validation, and indeed revealed a more severe perception of social transgressions following both mortality and meaning salience.

1156,"Of wealth and death: Materialism, mortality salience, and consumption behavior","Theoretical work suggests that feelings of insecurity produce materialistic behavior, but most empirical evidence is correlational in nature. The authors therefore experimentally activated feelings of insecurity by having some Ss write short essays about death (mortality-salience condition). Study 1 used a sample of 60 college students, and Study 2 used a sample of 73 college students. In Study 1, Ss in the mortality-salience condition, compared with Ss who wrote about a neutral condition, had higher financial expectations for themselves 15 yrs in the future, in terms of both their overall worth and the amount they would be spending on pleasurable items such as clothing and entertainment. Study 2 extended these findings by demonstrating that Ss exposed to death became more greedy and consumed more resources in a forest-management game. Results are discussed with regard to humanistic and terror-management theories of materialism.

1157,From avoidance to approach: The effects of mortality salience and attachment on the motivation to repair troubled relationships,"Previous research has shown that mortality salience ({MS}) increases relational strivings and that attachment style moderates these effects. The present study investigated the effects of {MS} and attachment on relational strivings toward troubled close relationship partners (family members, friends, and romantic partners). {MS} increased participants’ expectations for improvement in their troubled family relationships. In particular, {MS} increased fearful-avoidant individuals’ relational strivings toward troubled family members. The same pattern emerged for friendships, controlling for relationship importance. However, {MS} decreased individuals’ expectations for improvement in their troubled romantic relationships. The present research extends both the terror management and attachment literature, suggesting that {MS} can motivate fearful-avoidant individuals to overcome their avoidant tendency and repair their troubled relationships.

1158,Deep cognitive activation: A new approach to the unconscious,"Deep cognitive activation occurs when a thought is so accessible as to have measurable effects on behavior or judgment, but is yet not consciously reportable. This state of mind has unique properties mimicking some characteristics of the psychoanalytic unconscious, but following theoretically from a consideration of processes of cognitive activation. The sources and consequences of deep cognitive activation are examined, with a view toward understanding how this state is implicated in the assessment, etiology, and treatment of psychopathology.

1159,Longevity increased by positive self-perceptions of aging,"This research found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging, measured up to 23 years earlier, lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. This advantage remained after age, gender, socioeconomic status, loneliness, and functional health were included as covariates. It was also found that this effect is partially mediated by will to live. The sample consisted of 660 individuals aged 50 and older who participated in a community-based survey, the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement ({OLSAR}). By matching the {OLSAR} to mortality data recently obtained from the National Death Index, the authors were able to conduct survival analyses. The findings suggest that the self-perceptions of stigmatized groups can influence longevity.

1160,"The moderating role of mortality salience: An examination of political ideology, voter-outcome variables, and political advertisements","The purpose of this dissertation is to examine terror management theory in conjunction with immigration and economy issue advertisements. Specifically, this study examines how voters' intent to vote for a conservative 2012 Presidential candidate, emotion toward a conservative 2012 Presidential candidate, and immigration anxiety are affected when their mortality is made salient before viewing an issue advertisement (either immigration or economy). To test the hypotheses, linear regression models were used. Most of the results reflect a non-significant interaction between political ideology and mortality salience. However, results do show one significant two-way interaction. The significant two-way interaction with positive emotion suggests that as death salient participants fall further to the right on the liberal/conservative scale, there is more positive emotion toward a conservative candidate than their non-death salient counterparts. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Harvell, Lindsey Anne",0,,1159
1161,Factors beyond lack of knowledge that predict 'I don't know' responses to surveys that assess {HPV} knowledge,"Accurately assessing the public’s knowledge about the human papilloma virus ({HPV}) and the {HPV} vaccine remains critical for informing health education interventions aimed at increasing vaccine uptake. Responding 'don’t know' ({DK}) to survey questions that assess knowledge is common and {DK} responders are often systematically different from other responders, resulting in potential for bias. This study aimed to advance our understanding of {DK} responding to {HPV} knowledge items. Data from the nationally representative Health Information National Trends Survey Wave 5 Cycle 1 (N = 2,034) were used. Information seeking about cancer, information avoidance, health-related self-efficacy, and several cancer beliefs were examined as predictors of {DK} responding to six items that assessed {HPV} knowledge. {DKs} represented nearly half of responses. Adjusting for demographic factors, lower health-related self-efficacy, and greater information avoidance, cancer-mortality salience, and perceived ambiguity were associated with more {DK} responding, ps {\textless} .05. Even participants with incorrect responses had greater health-related self-efficacy, and less information avoidance, perceived ambiguity, and cancer-mortality salience than those who responded with {DK}. {DK} responding to {HPV} knowledge items is common and reflects factors beyond insufficient knowledge or motivation. Addressing causes of {DK} responding may reduce bias and improve interventions informed by surveys.

1162,Caregivers reflecting on the early days of childhood cancer,"Much research examining primary caregivers of children with cancer has focused on their distress levels and coping strategies. Drawing on qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 38 Australian primary caregivers, this article examines their experiences through their child’s cancer diagnosis and early treatment period. However, it does so retrospectively with their child in remission (a minimum of 5 years post diagnosis). This methodology gave caregivers the time to evaluate and reflect on their experiences through their child’s cancer. Interviews with caregivers were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a grounded constant comparison approach. The concept of neo-normal was developed to represent caregivers’ responses to having a child with cancer—characterised by the existential threat of cancer, the shattering of notions of control and certainty in their capacity to protect their child’s well-being and reliance on medical intervention. Paradoxically, conceding to this disempowered position facilitated new ways to be a caregiver of a child with cancer. The findings illustrate the social processes and cultural context in which caregivers construct new normalising strategies as they transition through their child’s illness. The study also gives recognition to the vital care, advocacy and pseudo-nursing contributions that caregivers bring to the paediatric oncology setting.

1163,"We are made, not born: Empiricism is existentially useful","The perennial 'nativist-empiricist' debate in developmental science has far-reaching relevance in our existence. Two studies conducted under the terror management framework tested whether the empiricist developmental conception serves distal defensive purposes. Experiment 1 highlights the palliative existential effect of the empiricist conception since participants who read an empiricist essay exhibited less death thoughts than participants who read a nativist essay or a control essay. Experiment 2 gives support to the distal defensive function of the empiricist conception by showing that, unlike with the nativist or the control essay, people under mortality salience exhibited a higher need to rely on empiricism than participants in the control pain condition. The existential advantage of empiricism is explained by the fact that human development is shaped by a meaningful cultural blueprint. Our results are discussed in terms of the ontological and existential benefits of contemplating human intrinsic identity, ranging from its biology to its social behaviors as primarily influenced by the cultural environment.

1164,What is satisfying about satisfying events? Testing 10 candidate psychological needs,"Three studies compared 10 candidate psychological needs in an attempt to determine which are truly most fundamental for humans. Participants described 'most satisfying events' within their lives and then rated the salience of each of the 10 candidate needs within these events. Supporting self-determination theory postulates (Ryan \& Deci, 2000)—autonomy, competence, and relatedness, were consistently among the top 4 needs, in terms of both their salience and their association with event-related affect. Self-esteem was also important, whereas self-actualization or meaning, physical thriving, popularity or influence, and money–luxury were less important. This basic pattern emerged within three different time frames and within both U.S. and South Korean samples and also within a final study that asked, 'What's unsatisfying about unsatisfying events?' Implications for hierarchical theories of needs are discussed.

1165,Lumping the affective and behavioral responses to inconsistency: A lump too far?,"Comments on an article by Arie W. Kruglanski et al. (see record [rid]2018-51257-001[/rid]). Kruglanski and his colleagues conclude—quite rightly, I believe—that the epistemic and motivational aspects dissonance manipulations are typically confounded when interpreting their affective outcomes. But do the implications of this insight apply to the behavioral outcomes? This would be easier to conclude if the affective and behavioral outcomes appeared to be part of the same general process—if, for example, the affective consequences could be shown to cause the behavioral compensations. Is there indeed a link between downstream, consciously experienced negative affect and the behavioral response to inconsistency? Does an explicit feeling of dissonance cause dissonance reduction efforts? Does an affective response to visual inconsistencies, counter attitudinal behaviors or existential uncertainty motivate efforts to affirm moral values? The answer to these questions appears to be a clear and consistent no, mainly because most of these manipulations produce no measurable affect whatsoever. Measures of experienced affect are routinely included in experiments that arouse uncertainty of one kind or another, and they consistently record no affective response to the manipulation, be it a mortality reminder or a reverse-colored playing card.

Drawing upon terror management theory, we question whether meaningful media can also serve as anxiety buffer shielding against the threat of death, as they transport cultural worldviews and enhance self‐esteem among recipients. Results of an experimental study (N = 122) confirmed that participants under mortality salience appreciated a meaningful movie more than participants in a control condition. Further, only a meaningful movie, not a pleasurable or an informative film, decreased the necessity to activate further anxiety buffers after mortality salience. The findings are discussed in relation to entertainment media as means to handle existential fears.

1168,Tolerance and the politics of identity in the European union,"Objectives: The basic research problem in this article is whether hostility toward out‐groups is a product of events or whether the degree of hostility toward out‐groups exists independently of such events in the form of a generalized bigotry. Methods: We examine two countries that experienced threatening violent events from an unassimilated minority in order to determine if their levels of intolerance increased in the period between two runs of the World Values Survey when these violent events occurred. This article also examines six additional {EU} countries that did not experience such violent events. Results: In the six countries that did not experience violent events, the level of tolerance increased between the two waves of the World Values Survey while tolerance decreased in the two countries that experienced violent events. Conclusions: The strongest factor in fostering intolerance toward out‐groups is a perception of a violent, existential threat to one's way of life. Our analyses tentatively suggest the following factor may exacerbate levels of intolerance: the presence and strength of a nativist or populist party of identity mobilizing a rejection of out‐groups.

1169,Redressing undergraduate nursing education: Cultivating self-awareness,"Government statistics indicate evidence of present and future prodigious growth in the population of older adults in the United States. The professional nurse's cognitive and affective geriatric/gerontology skillsets have been identified as currently inadequate to provide therapeutic older adult care, highlighting the problem of a curricular gap in undergraduate nursing education. The literature connotes a correlation between a nursing learner's personal schemas, experience-based perceptions, mortality saliency, and one's receptiveness to engage in older adult learning and care. Applying the conceptual framework posited in schema and terror management theory, the research question for the study examined participant self-awareness of the older adult and older adulthood after reflecting on topics related to older adults. A descriptive qualitative case study was conducted with a purposive sample of 10 registered nurses who responded in writing to 5 guided reflective activities. A concluding face-to-face interview was conducted to enrich the written data. Data gathered from both sources were open coded and inductively analyzed, and 5 major themes emerged: (a) independence, (b) mortality saliency, (c) personhood, (d) the value of reflection as a self-awareness learning tool, and (e) geriatric career consideration. The identified themes were used to inform the development of the project's cognitive and affective gerontology learning course, facilitated through traditional lecture and constructivist learning. While illuminating the value of implementing self-reflection in geriatric nursing education, this study contributes to societal change by serving as a catalyst for reducing older adult health care vulnerability, enhancing the capacity for older adult and societal well-being, and curtailing health costs.

In Study 1, mortality salience increased university students’ perception that the events described in vignettes happened for a reason or purpose but only when the consequences were life altering and negative. In Study 2, mortality salience decreased university students’ perception that life-altering occurrences that affected other people were due to luck or chance. The results of these studies are interpreted as evidence that the need to believe that everything happens for a reason is motivated by a desire to manage existential anxiety.

A between-subjects 2 (subliminal prime/control) × 2 (supraliminal prime/control) design was used. The supraliminal prime prompted participants to answer questions about death. For the subliminal prime, the word death was presented outside of awareness. Both priming techniques differed significantly from a control in ability to elicit mortality salience. There was an interactive influence of both primes. Implications for unconscious neutral networks relating to death are discussed.

We address this research void by reporting the findings of two empirical studies—the first, an exploratory study of drivers' perceptions of texting while driving; the second, an experimental examination of the relative effectiveness of mortality salience ({MS}) primes in public service announcements ({PSAs}). Employing theory derived from the {MS} literature, we find that when verbal and/or visual cues to death/dying were used, participants' attitudes and behavioral intentions were altered in a positive direction. As compared to a control group, the primed {PSAs} produced less favorable attitudes and reduced intentions to text while driving in the future. Implications of these findings for consumers, social marketers, and policymakers are discussed, and future research directions are provided.

Terror management theory research has previously explored mortality salience effects on behavior in a variety of contexts, including legal judgments. We sought to extend this line of research by directly examining mortality salience effects in the context of capital trials. In Study 1, mock jurors who had been specifically asked to contemplate their own mortality and exposed to trial-related death references (Dual-Focused Mortality [{DFM}]) were more likely to appropriately weigh evidence regarding defendant future dangerousness than participants only exposed to trial-related death references (Trial-Focused Mortality [{TFM}]). In Study 2, we manipulated mitigating factor strength using a different capital sentencing scenario. Consistent with the results of Study 1, {DFM} participants were more likely to appropriately utilize mitigating evidence than {TFM} participants, particularly when they had more complete comprehension of relevant legal concepts.

1174,Dangerous terrorists as devoted actors - Evolutionary perspectives on social psychology.,"This chapter harnesses our recent cross-cultural experiments and fieldwork to better understand some of today's most dangerous terrorists as 'devoted actors'' motivated by 'sacred values'. Sacred values ({SVs}) are nonnegotiable preferences whose defense compels actions beyond evident reason, that is, regardless of risks or costs. Our research indicates that when {SVs} become embedded in fused groups of imagined kin who consider themselves in existential competition with other groups, then individuals in such groups (e.g., bands of brothers) become empowered to make great sacrifices and exertions, for ill or good. Devoted actors are most likely to commit themselves to extreme actions—and thus to be most dangerous—if they perceive themselves to be under existential threat from outside groups, and if their primary reference group forms around a prior action-oriented association, such as shared combat experience or even membership in a sports team.

1175,Perceiving pervasive discrimination among African Americans: Implications for group identification and well-being,"The processes involved in well-being maintenance among African Americans who differed in their attributions to prejudice were examined. A rejection–identification model was proposed where stable attributions to prejudice represent rejection by the dominant group. This results in a direct and negative effect on well-being. The model also predicts a positive effect on well-being that is mediated by minority group identification. In other words, the generally negative consequences of perceiving oneself as a victim of racial prejudice can be somewhat alleviated by identification with the minority group. Structural equation analyses provided support for the model and ruled out alternative theoretical possibilities. Perceiving prejudice as pervasive produces effects on well-being that are fundamentally different from those that may arise from an unstable attribution to prejudice for a single negative outcome.

In these studies, participants reported on their attachment style and generated actual-self–traits and unwanted-self–traits. Then, a 2nd session was conducted, in which impression formation about new persons (Study 1), the ease of retrieval of memories about known persons (Study 2), or memory inferences about learned features of fictional persons (Study 3) were assessed. Findings indicate that whereas anxious-ambivalent persons' impression formation, memory retrieval, and inferences about others reflected the projection of their actual-self-traits, avoidant persons' responses reflected the projection of their unwanted-self–traits. Findings are discussed in terms of the regulatory goals and strategies that characterize the mental representations of each attachment style.

We hypothesized that mortality salience would elicit less forgiveness in less committed relationships. In Experiment 1, participants were primed with either mortality salience or a physical pain control condition, recalled a recent hurtful interpersonal offense, and reported their degree of forgiveness. Mortality salience evoked less forgiveness in less committed relationships. In Experiment 2, participants were assigned to recall an offense that occurred in a low-commitment or high-commitment relationship. Again, mortality salience elicited less forgiveness in less committed relationships; it elicited more forgiveness in more committed relationships. Moreover, this interaction was mediated by empathy. Existential considerations may play an important role in the functioning of close relationships.

1178,Fear and uncertainty in the face of death: The role of life after death in group identification,"Terror management theory argues that mortality‐induced terror motivates group identification. Uncertainty–identity theory argues that uncertainty about what happens after death motivates group identification. Two experiments were conducted to test the latter reasoning. In Experiment 1 (n = 187), mortality salience was manipulated, and uncertainty about the afterlife was measured to predict national identification. As hypothesized, mortality salience strengthened identification only among those who were uncertain about the afterlife. In Experiment 2 (n = 177), mortality salience was manipulated as before, but belief in an afterlife was also manipulated—participants were primed to believe that there was an afterlife, there was not an afterlife, or the existence of an afterlife was uncertain. As in Experiment 1, mortality salience strengthened identification only among those who were existentially uncertain. These experiments show that uncertainty plays a significant role in reactions to mortality salience, and support uncertainty–identity theory’s analysis of the role of self‐uncertainty in ideological conviction and group behavior.

1180,Death goes to the polls: A meta‐analysis of mortality salience effects on political attitudes,"Terror management theory posits that people are motivated to affirm cultural meaning systems, including political ideologies, to avoid the awareness of mortality. Accordingly, studies show that increasing mortality salience ({MS}) intensifies people’s attitudes toward political issues and figures. However, whereas in some studies {MS} increases affirmation of preexisting political ideologies, be they liberal or conservative (supporting a 'worldview-defense hypothesis'), in other studies {MS} elicits a general shift toward conservatism, regardless of preexisting ideology (supporting a 'conservative-shift hypothesis'). The current study used meta-analysis to assess the overall magnitude of {MS} effects on explicitly political attitudes and to clarify the nature of these effects by comparing effect sizes for these competing hypotheses. The overall effect of {MS} on political attitudes was large (r = .50). The effects of {MS}-induced worldview defense (r = .35) and conservative shifting (r = .22) were significant and statistically equivalent. We discuss the conditions (e.g., contextual salience of political values) under which conservative shifting or worldview defense occurs.

Mikulincer and Florian (2000) have shown that while mortality salience increases the desire for intimacy in securely attached individuals, the insecurely attached use cultural world views rather than close relationships to cope with fear of death. Study 1 used the romantic belief scale to compare the effects of attachment style and mortality salience on the cultural aspects of close relationships and showed that the only the insecurely attached were more romantic following mortality salience. Study 2 replicated this effect and demonstrated that this difference was not simply due to lower self-esteem in the insecurely attached. The additional inclusion of the Relationship assessment questionnaire failed to provide any evidence that the securely attached were affected by the mortality salience manipulation, even on a more interpersonal measure.

What originated as a hodgepodge of cognitive, affective, and behavioral measures and manipulations has become a clearly organized, well-validated set of procedures for determining vulnerability to existential concerns. Our primary focus in this chapter is to identify these instances of terror mismanagement by documenting personality and clinical variables that predict especially intense or otherwise dysfunctional responses to mortality salience. We hope that summarizing the role of personality and clinical factors in terror management processes—and concretely defining how they and the defenses they produce are measured—provides the basis for viable approaches that clinicians may adopt when assessing and addressing their clients' existential concerns. With this aim in mind, the final portion of this chapter is devoted to a preliminary attempt at modeling a multimethod clinical assessment strategy that integrates the diverse assessment tools herein described.

1184,Dehumanization: A threat and solution to terror management - Humanness and dehumanization.,"From the perspective of terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986), people (unlike other animals) face a fundamental psychological conflict between wanting to live and knowing they will die. This conflict is managed by creating, and investing in, cultural systems of meaning and value that, in outliving the self, provide a sense of symbolic immortality or, in the case of life after death, the promise of literal immortality. Put succinctly, death still stings, but it stings less if people know that some part of their selves will live on and that they have left a mark on the world. But the sheer physicality of humans—similar to that of any other dying animal—undermines this symbolic immortality and even belief in literal immortality (e.g., Goldenberg et al., 2001; Heflick, Goldenberg, Hart, \& Kamp, 2012). From this perspective, we can understand the tendency for humans to see themselves, and those they identify with, as uniquely human (i.e., distinct from animals) as a response to the threat of mortality. In contrast, another facet of nonhumanness, perceiving a person as an object, might actually be desirable in terms of coping with mortality concerns. As Goldenberg (2013) recently argued, objects, despite their many nonredeeming characteristics, are free of one characteristic that human beings abhor: mortality. Indeed, there is evidence that women may be construed as objects to stave off existential concerns associated with mortality and their physicality (e.g., Morris, Goldenberg, \& Heflick, 2012). In these two defenses against the psychological threat of mortality— distancing from animals and objectification—we offer a unique perspective as to a cause of conceiving others, and the self, as nonhuman.

Studies 3 and 4 then focus more specifically on the valence and specificity of culture-oriented endorsements, revealing that death thoughts outside focal attention increase the effectiveness of culture-oriented endorsers only on the behaviors specifically endorsed and only when the endorser is characterized as possessing cultural value.

1186,"Denial of evolution: An exploration of cognition, culture and affect","Numerous polls conducted in the United States on the subject of the diversity of life on earth show an approximate 50/50 split between belief in biological evolution and belief in biblical creationism. Hypotheses generated to explain this have focused primarily on cognitive and cultural characteristics of individuals who reject Darwinian evolutionary theory. To date the consideration of affective characteristics has been lacking. In this exploratory study, the cultural measures of church attendance and belief in God, the cognitive measure of Need for Cognitive Closure and the affective measures of fear and disgust all correlate with denial of evolutionary theories. Limits and implications of exploring the affective motivations of cognitions will be discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2018 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Garvey, Kilian James",0,,1185
1187,'A vengefulness of the impotent': The pain of in-group inferiority and schadenfreude toward successful out-groups,"Nietzsche (1887/1967) suggested that the emotional pain individuals feel about their in-group's inferiority leads them to feel the pleasure of schadenfreude when a successful out-group fails. To test this idea, 2 studies examined a fictitious competition between real universities. Individuals' pain about their in-group's inferiority explained schadenfreude at the failure of a successful out-group better than dislike of the out-group, interest in the domain of competition, illegitimacy of the out-group's success, and illegitimacy of the in-group's inferiority. In addition, emotions regarding the out-group's success (i.e., envy, dislike-based anger, and illegitimacy-based anger) were weaker explanations of schadenfreude than the pain of in-group inferiority and anger based in this pain (which Nietzsche referred to as ressentiment). Thus, schadenfreude has more to do with the inferiority of the self than with the success of others. As well as providing evidence for a specific form of prejudice grounded in group-based emotions, this research also revives displacement explanations of prejudice toward 3rd parties.

1188,"A body of terror: Denial of death and the creaturely body - Meaning, mortality, and choice: The social psychology of existential concerns.","The author presents a terror management analysis of people’s attitudes toward their animal nature, as reflected in their bodies and physical sensations. Goldenberg’s central thesis is that human beings are caught in a perpetual struggle between (a) the need to deny their mortality and (b) reminders that they are flesh-and-blood creatures with animalistic needs and desires, a fact that indicates they are mortal, like any other animal. Goldenberg argues that when mortality concerns are salient, people distance themselves from the physicality of their bodies by concealing their more creaturely aspects or by imbuing the physical body with symbolic significance. She reviews research testing these hypotheses and shedding light on the effects of death awareness on attitudes toward the body, discomfort with bodily functions (e.g., eating, sex), the condemnation and objectification of women’s bodies, compliance with recommendations for maintaining good health, and belief in a life hereafter. This chapter exemplifies the creative value of organizing research around a powerful theory of existential concerns.

1189,Killing with a clean conscience: Existential angst and the paradox of morality - The social psychology of morality: Exploring the causes of good and evil.,"Our discussion in this chapter is intended to shed light on issues that have been debated by generations of theologians, moral philosophers, and social scientists. Do morals encourage people to transcend egotistical concerns and consider the condition of the 'other,' or do they serve the opposite function of glorifying one’s self-image and group’s status under the guise of benevolent concern? Do morals reflect context-dependent and relativistic prescriptions for human behavior or universal rules of human conduct? How can people commit acts, under the guise of moral righteousness, that most outsiders would view as immoral and even evil? How do the group-level and individual-level functions of moral behavior relate to each other? In this chapter, we focus primarily on the role of moral concerns in intergroup conflicts and the potential of moral principles to both defuse and intensify conflicts between groups. Paradoxically, moral strivings often increase the viciousness of interactions between people with different group identities, partly because of the diverse moral principles cultures use to govern behavior. Although moral principles are typically thought of as promoting more humane and other-oriented behavior (see Chapter 21, this volume), they can also promote the defense of one’s own group, which often includes vanquishing another group perceived as evil. To shed light on these issues, we use terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1997) to explain how moral principles, which often promote group cohesion, are used by individuals in regulating themselves (e.g., Carver \& Scheier, 1981). We suggest that moral behavior involves implicit calculations aimed at enabling an individual to maintain self-esteem by means of enhancing a moral self-image. This often entails sacrificing one set of moral values for another, which in many cases leads to a 'righteous' crusade or jihad against another group.

1190,Effects of uncertainty and mortality salience on worldview defense reactions in Turkey,"This research explores effects of uncertainty and mortality salience on reactions to violations or bolstering of cultural norms and values. Some recent studies have suggested that worldview defense reactions are better accounted for by reminders of personal uncertainty than mortality. These findings have been disputed, however, as they have not been found outside the Netherlands. The current research was conducted in Turkey, a culture distinguished by high uncertainty avoidance values compared to both the {USA} and the Netherlands. Results reveal that both uncertainty and mortality salience influence reactions of Turkish participants to essays negative about basic rights of Turkish women, but that uncertainty salience had larger effects than mortality salience. We argue that mortality salience may be an indirect manipulation of uncertainty concerns, which explains why a direct manipulation of uncertainty salience may have a bigger impact on reactions to violations of important cultural norms and values.

1191,Existential factors influencing end-of-life treatment decision making: The role of death anxiety and meaning in life in choosing to receive destination therapy left ventricular assist device in advanced heart failure patients,"During the course of progressive heart failure, patients must make many decisions regarding medical treatments. One aggressive treatment option that can prolong life for advanced heart failure patients is the destination therapy left ventricular assist device ({DT} {LVAD}). Patients are asked to determine which treatments to pursue, like whether or not to receive a {DT} {LVAD}, yet little research has examined the factors that influence these decisions. One area of determinants that has been entirely overlooked is existential factors. When diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, patients' salience of death increases, and they often experience end of life fears. According to Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), when faced with death, one establishes cultural worldviews that give life meaning and provide an illusion of immortality. This meaning, in a sense, protects one from death anxiety. However, death anxiety and meaning in life have yet to be studied in terms of medical decision making. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine how death anxiety and meaning in life influence the decision to receive a {DT} {LVAD} among patients with advanced heart failure using vignette methodology. The primary hypotheses of this study were that (a) death anxiety and meaning would be inversely related in that higher meaning would relate to lower death anxiety, and (b) both death anxiety and meaning would predict the likelihood of deciding to receive a {DT} {LVAD} in patients with advanced heart failure. Results from the current study indicate that meaning in life and death anxiety were not significantly related to each other, yet this lack of significance aligns well with {TMT}, which states that humans essentially suppress death anxiety and do so by focusing instead on what gives their life. These existential factors did not predict the decision to receive a {DT} {LVAD}, yet it is likely that basic methodological issues were present, namely the use of hypothetical vignettes, thus impacting the results. Further research is needed to fully understand how existential factors impact patients and their medical decisions, ideally with longitudinal designs to examine both prospective and actual medical decisions.

1193,Networks of change: Extending Alaska-based communication networks to meet the challenges of the Anthropocene,"The Anthropocene is a contested term. As I conceptualize it throughout this dissertation, the Anthropocene is defined by an increased coupling of social and environmental systems at the global scale such that the by-products of human processes dominate the global stratigraphic record. Additionally, I connect the term to a worldview that sees this increased coupling as an existential threat to humanity's ability to sustain life on the planet. Awareness that the planet-wide scale of this coupling is fundamentally a new element in earth history is implicit in both understandings. How individuals and communities are impacted by this change varies greatly depending on a host of locally specific cross-scale factors. The range of scales (physical and social) that must be negotiated to manage these impacts places novel demands on the communication networks that shape human agency. Concern for how these demands are being met, and whose interests are being served in doing so, are the primary motivation for my research. My work is grounded in the communication-oriented theoretical traditions of media ecology and the more recent social-ecological system conceptualizations promoted in the study of resilience. I combine these ideas through a mixed methodology of digital ethnography and social network analysis to explore the communication dynamics of four Alaska-based social-ecological systems. The first two examples capture communication networks that formed in response to singular, rapid change environmental events (a coastal storm and river flood). The latter two map communication networks that have formed in response to more diffuse, slower acting environmental changes (a regional webinar series and an international arctic change conference). In each example, individuals or organizations enter and exit the mapped network(s) as they engage in the issue and specific communication channel being observed. Under these parameters a cyclic pattern of network expansion and contraction is identified. Expansion events are heavily influenced by established relationships retained during previous contraction periods. Many organizational outreach efforts are focused on triggering and participating in expansion events, however my observations highlight the role of legacy networks in system change. I suggest that for organizations interested in fostering sustainable social-ecological relationships in the Anthropocene, strategic intervention may best be accomplished through careful consideration of how communicative relationships are maintained immediately following and in between expansion events. In the final sections of my dissertation I present a process template to support organizations interested in doing so. I include a complete set of learning activities to facilitate organizational use as well as examples of how the Alaska Native Knowledge Network is currently applying the process to meet their unique organizational needs.

1194,"Older adults and generativity: Developmental, experimental, and clinical advances in terror management theory","Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986) offers an empirical framework to explore how human beings function despite their fear of death. {TMT} studies have shown that in order to buffer death anxiety, people strive to meet the standards of their cultural worldview. These studies have been conducted almost exclusively with younger participants. Preliminary research with older adults has indicated that seniors might not respond to {TMT} experimental manipulations in the same way as their younger counterparts (Maxfield et al., 2007). This dissertation is organized into three papers as well as an introduction and a conclusion. The goal of paper one was to provide a review of {TMT} research from a developmental perspective. One core theme that emerged from this review was the importance of developmental theory in {TMT} research when studying participants of various age groups, especially older adults. The purpose of the second paper was to test a developmentally relevant construct that may buffer death anxiety in later life, namely generativity. Drawing from Erikson’s (1959) psychosocial stages of development, it was hypothesized that generativity may encompass unique death-denying properties for older adults. One hundred and seventy-nine seniors were recruited to determine if subtle mortality salience inductions would lead participants to rate both their generativity and their child/grandchild success higher than a blatant and control group. As expected, participants who were exposed to subtle death primes rated themselves as having significantly higher levels of generativity than the other two groups but this was not the case with child or grandchild success (with the exception of an item measuring common sense from the grandchild success measure). Explanations for these results are discussed in light of the literature on generativity and {TMT}. The results from paper two indicated that developmental considerations are integral to {TMT} design. Finally, in the third paper, the {TMT} conceptualization of mental health as it relates to death anxiety was reviewed. The psychotherapy literature regarding the treatment of death anxiety was also described. Four areas for future investigation are proposed that offer possibilities for meaningful theoretical and clinical integration benefitting {TMT} researchers and psychotherapists alike.

1195,The working self-concept in transference: Significant-other activation and self change,"This research tested the hypothesis that changes in the working self-concept emerge in transference, defined as the activation and application of a significant-other representation to a new person and indexed by relevant inferences and memory (e.g., S. M. Andersen \& A. Baum, see record 82-21185; S. M. Andersen et al, see record 82-40398). In an idiographic-nomothetic design, participants learned of a target person who resembled their own or a yoked participant's positively or negatively toned significant other. Results replicated the basic memory effect verifying transference. As predicted, the working self-concept changed in the transference condition. After learning about the new person, participants' freely listed self features shifted; the working self-concept became more infused with aspects of the self reflecting the self when with this significant other. Relevant changes in self evaluation were observed. Hence, changes in the working self-concept occurred in transference.

1196,Stereotypical thinking as a mediating factor in the association between exposure to terror and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among Israeli youth,"Background and Objectives: The negative impact of exposure to terror on mental health, as well as on the perceptions of each side of the conflict toward the other, is well-documented. However, the association between stereotyping, concomitant with perceived threat, and anxiety, was rarely investigated. The current study examined information processing attributes and exposure to terror as predictors of {PTSD} symptoms among youth at inter-group conflict, with stereotypical thinking toward a threatening out-group as a possible mediator. Design: Cross-sectional, with exposure to terror, need for cognitive structure ({NCS}), efficacy at fulfilling the need for closure ({EFNC}) and self-esteem, predicting stereotypical thinking and {PTSD} symptoms. Method: Ninth graders (N = 263) from two residential areas in Israel, varying in their degree of exposure to terror, responded to a self-report questionnaire tapping the above variables. Results: Stereotypical thinking was found to mediate the association between exposure to terror and {PTSD} symptoms, but not the association between the {NCS} and {EFNC} interaction and {PTSD} symptoms. Conclusions: The findings support terror management theory, so that a negative and rigid perception makes it difficult to construct coherent world-view, thus contributing to aggregation of existential anxiety and {PTSD} symptoms.

1197,When death thoughts lead to death fears: Mortality salience increases death anxiety for individuals who lack meaning in life,"Research derived from terror management theory demonstrates that subtle reminders of mortality increase strivings for meaning. It is argued that such strivings reflect efforts to prevent the anxiety that death reminders may otherwise cause. However, no research has directly tested the assertions that subtle mortality primes increase death anxiety and perceptions of meaning in life moderate this effect. The current study examined these predictions. Meaning in life was measured, death cognition primed, and death anxiety assessed. A mortality prime increased death anxiety, but only for individuals who lack perceptions of meaning in life. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

1198,"Objects of primary value: Fame, celebrity, and the quest for symbolic immortality","Research guided by Terror Management Theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986) has provided powerful evidence that reminders of death motivate defensive behaviors designed to preserve self-esteem and buffer against the conscious awareness of personal mortality. Fascination with fame and celebrity are posited to be important within the {TMT} framework, as they reflect the human need for symbolic immortality, whether direct or vicarious. The present research examined three basic hypotheses. First, reminders of death should lead individuals to view fame and celebrity as particularly desirable for the self, and to greater fascination with celebrities. Second, the experience of vicarious fame should protect individuals from the threat of mortality salience, thus reducing their need to engage in terror managing worldview defensive behavior. Third, the belief that one has the potential to achieve celebrity should afford the protective worldview provided by fame and celebrity, and reduce subsequent worldview defense. Three experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. Study 1 examined the relationship between reminders of death (mortality salience), valuing fame and celebrity for the self, and ratings of celebrity related information. Celebrity information (but not valuing fame and celebrity for the self) was viewed more favorably by individuals reminded of their death, provided they expressed anxiety. Study 2 examined whether vicarious fame might serve to reduce terror managing worldview defensive responses following mortality salience. Support for the hypothesized effect in Study 2 was not found; instead, an unexpected and opposite effect was observed, such that increased mortality salience led to decreased worldview defense. Study 3 examined whether celebrity potential would reduce worldview defensive behavior following reminders of death. This hypothesis was not supported. However, learning one has any chance of becoming a celebrity was comforting to individuals when mortality was salient. Furthermore, results from Study 1 and 3 suggest that women may value celebrity and fame more than men. Taken as a whole, the research represents an important first step in understanding the role of fame and celebrity within the Terror Management Theory framework.

Thus, knowledge of the divergent trajectories of grieving or their antecedent predictors is lacking. This study gathered prospective data on 205 individuals several years prior to the death of their spouse and at 6- and 18-mo postloss. Five core bereavement patterns were identified: common grief, chronic grief, chronic depression, improvement during bereavement, and resilience. Common grief was relatively infrequent, and the resilient pattern most frequent. The authors tested key hypotheses in the literature pertaining to chronic grief and resilience by identifying the preloss predictors of each pattern. Chronic grief was associated with preloss dependency and resilience with preloss acceptance of death and belief in a just world.

In each study a sample with a high expected incidence of falling in love (first- and second-year undergraduates in the fall term) was tested 5 times over 10 weeks. At each testing participants indicated whether they had fallen in love and either made open-ended lists of self-descriptive terms (Study 1;N = 329) or completed standard self-efficacy and self-esteem measures (Study 2;N = 529). As predicted, after falling in love there was greater change and increased diversity of self-concept domains (Study 1) and increased self-efficacy and self-esteem (Study 2). Partial correlation analyses suggested that results in both studies were not due to mood change.

Overall, 164 articles with 277 experiments were included. {MS} yielded moderate effects (r = .35) on a range of worldview- and self-esteem-related dependent variables ({DVs}), with effects increased for experiments using (a) American participants, (b) college students, (c) a longer delay between {MS} and the {DV}, and (d) people-related attitudes as the {DV}. Gender and self-esteem may moderate {MS} effects differently than previously thought. Results are compared to other reviews and examined with regard to alternative explanations of {TMT}.

1203,Terror management and politics: Comparing and integrating the 'conservative shift' and 'political worldview defense' hypotheses - Denying death: An interdisciplinary approach to terror management theory.,"The role of fear in politics is, in itself, quite frightening. The injection of unchecked emotion into processes by which civilizations rise and fall runs counter to the rationalist principles upon which democracies are founded. But how, in particular, do fear and-anxiety govern us? How do real or imagined vulnerabilities influence the content of our political worldviews? Some insights come from lines of research in social, personality, and political psychology examining the roles of motivational and emotional processes in the formation and maintenance of political beliefs and attitudes. This work highlights how largely unconscious existential threats—triggered by a political environment of war, murder, and corruption—condition the positions people take on socioeconomic issues, how they vote, and their perceptions of reality as a whole. But important questions remain; The present chapter endeavors to compare and integrate competing perspectives and research on the impact of these existential threats, particularly those linked to the awareness of death. In one view, death-related threats provoke defensive clinging to distinctively conservative ideologies—clamping down on the status quo for dear life in order to combat the uncertainties of existence, even if doing so runs against the grain ofa liberal's preexisting worldview. The competing view from terror management theory posits such threats have a polarizing effect, motivating individuals to seize upon whatever political ideology has served their personal death-denying needs in the past, be it liberal or conservative.

The purpose of the present research was to investigate whether naming children after oneself stems from a desire to symbolically extend one’s life. Participants were primed with thoughts of death or a control topic and then asked the likelihood that they would name future offspring after themselves or relatives. Results showed that people in the mortality salience condition reported a greater likelihood of naming their children after themselves, but not after relatives. Attachment orientation moderated this effect in that anxious individuals in the mortality salience condition expressed an even greater desire to name their children after themselves.

1205,Introduction to the special issue on diversity and leadership,"Theories of leadership have neglected diversity issues. As the population within the United States and in countries throughout the world becomes increasingly diverse, the contexts in which leadership occurs within institutions and communities will also become increasingly diverse. Attention to diversity is not simply about representation of leaders from diverse groups in the ranks of leadership. Attention to diversity means paradigm shifts in our theories of leadership so as to make them inclusive; it means incorporating explanations of how dimensions of diversity shape our understanding of leadership. It means paying attention to the perceptions and expectations of diverse leaders by diverse followers and to how bias influences the exercise of leadership. Although leadership theories have evolved and reflect changing social contexts, they remain silent on issues of equity, diversity, and social justice. Theories of leadership need to be expanded to incorporate diversity if they are to be relevant for the 21st century amidst new social contexts, emerging global concerns, and changing population demographics.

1206,Nostalgia as a repository of social connectedness: The role of attachment-related avoidance,"Individuals who are low (compared with high) in attachment-related avoidance rely on social bonds to regulate distress, and the authors hypothesized that nostalgia can be a repository of such social connectedness. Studies 1–3 showed a positive association between loneliness and nostalgia when attachment-related avoidance was low, but not when it was high. Study 4 revealed that low-avoidance individuals derived more social connectedness from nostalgia than did high-avoidance individuals. Study 5 extended these findings and demonstrated that, in addition to being a source of social connectedness, nostalgia increased participants’ perceived capacity to provide emotional support to others. As in the case of social connectedness, this beneficial effect of nostalgia was significantly stronger when attachment-related avoidance was low (compared with high).

1207,Examining the relations between rumination and adjustment: Do ethnic differences exist between Asian and European Americans?,"Past studies have pointed to the dysfunctional nature of rumination in adults. However, past research has not examined ethnic variations. Accordingly, this study examined ethnic differences in rumination in 184 Asian American and 238 European American college students. Consistent with expectations, Asian Americans were found to ruminate more than European Americans. However, rumination was found to have a weaker association with measures of adjustment (viz., affectivity, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, and life satisfaction) in Asian Americans compared with European Americans. As a result of conducting regression analyses to determine whether rumination was a unique predictor of functioning beyond affectivity, we found rumination to be a more distinct and useful predictor of functioning for Asian Americans than for European Americans. Overall, compared with findings for European Americans, our findings indicate that important ethnic differences need to be considered in studying rumination in Asian Americans.

1209,Enhanced and restricted interrogation techniques: Views of licensed mental health professionals,"This study examined the relationship between acceptance of interrogation techniques used in the interviewing of suspected terrorists and various personal and professional variables in licensed mental health professionals; of particular interest was rated level of patriotism and acceptance patterns. Interrogation techniques included Enhanced ({EIT}) and Restricted ({RIT}). Level of patriotism was measured by a self-report. Additionally, knowledge of {EIT} and {RIT} was measured to assess for any patterns of acceptance. Finally, interest in attending continuing education classes on the use of interrogation techniques during military cross-examinations was also evaluated. It was predicted that the level of patriotism would be associated with acceptance of {EIT} and {RIT}. This was based on the theory of hot cognitions (Abelson, 1963),  Motivated Reasoning (Lodge and Taber, 2005), and the Terror Management Theory (Greenberg et al., 1990). One hundred and three participants completed the self-administered survey. This sample was primarily male between the ages of 30 and 50 and represented a White/ Anglo or European American ethnicity and a Hispanic or Latino/Latina ethnicity. The majority of the participants identified as being moderately patriotic and liberal in their political orientation and representative of the cognitive-behavioral theoretical orientation. Enhanced and Restricted Interrogation Techniques were divided into two categories, five physical distress techniques and three separation techniques. Spearman's rho nonparametric correlation was conducted on acceptance of all five of the physical distress interrogation techniques in relationship to levels of patriotism. Results indicated techniques involving physical distress was significantly correlated with levels of patriotism, for all but one of the techniques: Wall Standing, Stress Positions, Sleep Deprivation, and Insects. The only exception to this was the technique of Waterboarding, which was not correlated with levels of patriotism. Results comparing levels of patriotism and acceptance of so-called separation techniques also demonstrated significant associations for two of the three techniques: Confinement, Physical Separation, and a marked trend for this association was also found with the third technique of Field Separation. A two-sample non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test was conducted to compare patterns of frequencies. Results found knowledge of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques was not associated with different patterns of acceptance, while the overwhelming majority of participants had no knowledge of Restricted Interrogation techniques and, as a consequence, no analyses could be conducted. These findings did not demonstrate any differences between techniques using physical torture and techniques using psychological torture. Finally, irrespective of sociodemographic or professional variables, results show higher levels of interest for participating in professional development opportunities when examining military interrogation techniques. Overall, the data supported the theory of hot cognitions (Abelson, 1963) and Motivated Reasoning (Lodge and Taber, 2005). It is likely that these types of decisions will be heavily influenced by affective components, rather than formal knowledge. Psychoeducation seminars that reference the notion of hot cognitions (Abelson, 1963) are recommended so that mental health professionals are aware of the processes underlying their possibly biased emotional components in decisions making.

University students from the United States, England, and Australia (N = 1,042) completed a questionnaire regarding their attitudes about aging and older adults. Results indicated that sex, age, beliefs about personal aging, and death anxiety explained 30.4\% of the variance for participants’ dread of looking old. Theoretical hypotheses were supported by our findings. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Chonody, Jill M. and Teater, Barbra",0,,1209
1211,Death and design: The terror management function of teleological beliefs,"Humans have a tendency to endorse teleological beliefs about the world. According to terror management theory, teleological or purposeful beliefs about the world help people cope with the awareness of mortality. Though research is generally consistent with this assertion, it has not been directly tested. Three studies tested and supported the notion that teleological beliefs about the world serve a terror management function. In ‘‘Study 1’’, experimentally elevated teleological beliefs reduced death-thought accessibility. In ‘‘Studies 2 and 3’’, mortality salience increased teleological beliefs, even if this resulted in judgment errors. Alternative explanations were tested and did not account for the findings.

1212,"Compliance and resistance to the logic of ethnic conflict during the siege of Sarajevo (Invited voice) - War, community, and social change: Collective experiences in the former Yugoslavia.","War in Sarajevo changed the importance and quality of existing ethno-national differences. Before, they were merely one aspect of identity, but during the war, ethno-national identities became central to the processes of making meaning and building society. What was once understood by many as diversity and often interpreted as an asset rather than a threat—as in the former Yugoslavian ideology of 'brotherhood and unity'—transformed under the existential threat and mass violence into divisions: mistrust, bitterness and resentment, and, in the worst cases, perhaps also hatred and a craving for revenge.

1213,The effect of mortality salience and belief in afterlife on the manifestation of homonegativity,"If derogation of out-groups serves the function of bolstering self-esteem, it is possible that this effect can be counteracted by means of existential relief. Two variables were presented in a 2 × 2 factorial to a population of primarily college students: a mortality salience ({MS}) variable and an afterlife variable, in which participants read 'scientific' accounts that either supported or denied the existence of a literal afterlife. Homonegativity was utilised as a dependent measure of out-group derogation. In the predicted manner, mortality salience and afterlife variables interacted to predict significantly different levels of homonegativity. When participants were subconsciously primed with {MS}, their psychological need to derogate dissimilar others was significantly lowered if they were assured of an afterlife. These results demonstrate that the effects of {MS} can be attenuated by presenting existential relief through assurance of literal afterlife.

1214,Happiness and stereotypic thinking in social judgment,"Four experiments examined the effects of happiness on the tendency to use stereotypes in social judgment. In each experiment, individuals who had been induced to feel happy rendered more stereotypic judgments than did those in a neutral mood. Exp 1 demonstrated this phenomenon with a mood induction procedure that involved recalling life experiences. Exps 2 and 3 suggested that the greater reliance on stereotypes evident in the judgments of happy individuals was not attributable to cognitive capacity deficits created by intrusive happy thoughts or by cognitively disruptive excitement or energetic arousal that may accompany the experience of happiness. In Exp 4, happy individuals again were found to render more stereotypic judgments, except under conditions in which they had been told that they would be held accountable for their judgments. These results suggest that although happy people's tendency to engage in stereotypic thinking may be pervasive, they are quite capable of avoiding the influence of stereotypes in their judgments when situational factors provide a motivational impetus for such effort.

1215,Validation of personal identity as a terror management mechanism: Evidence that sex-role identity moderates mortality salience effects,"Two studies examined the effects of mortality salience on the willingness to interact with sex-typed and cross-sex-typed stereotypic targets while assessing the moderating role of sex-role identity. In both studies, Israeli adolescent participants completed the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, were exposed to a mortality salience or control induction, and rated their willingness to interact with two same-sex targets that were defined by either feminine or masculine stereotypic traits. Study 1 included 169 boys; Study 2 consisted of 200 girls. Results from both studies indicated that mortality salience led sex-typed individuals (masculine boys, feminine girls) to report less willingness to interact with same-sex peers who are cross-sex-typed. In contrast, mortality salience led cross-sex-typed individuals (feminine boys, masculine girls) to report more willingness to interact with same-sex peers who are cross-sex-typed. Findings were discussed in light of the function of personal identity validation as a possible terror management mechanism.

1216,"Legacy, leisure and the ‘work hard—Play hard’ hypothesis","Do people who work hard also tend to play hard? We tested this hypothesis using an online questionnaire-based study of a large volunteer sample of university undergraduate students. Participants responded to questions designed to detect variation in attraction to accomplishment/fame (or ‘work’) and attraction to leisure (or ‘play’). Additional questions were asked, for use in post-hoc exploratory analyses, to evaluate attraction to parenthood and attraction to religion, as well as assessment of mortality salience and negative mood. Using partial correlation analyses, by far the strongest pairwise relationship was between attraction to accomplishment and attraction to leisure. Both were also positively correlated with mortality salience. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis distinguished two clusters (groups) of participants suggesting two general categories of mortality anxiety buffering strategies involving legacy delusion: one incorporating primarily religion combined with parenthood—a ‘religious family-oriented’ type —and one involving primarily accomplishment (also with attraction to parenthood), but combined strongly with leisure in place of religion—a ‘secular go-getter’; the ‘work hard—play hard’ type.

We aimed to determine if there are differences in the death anxiety and self esteem levels between Filipino youth and older adults, if there is a relationship between the two variables, and if age is a moderator for the two variables. We utilized a two-part analysis of the study wherein the first analysis compared death anxiety and self-esteem between the two age groups; and the second analysis utilized correlation to review the strength and relationship of the variables. 520 participants (260 youth and 260 older adults) completed the Templer Death Anxiety Scale—Filipino Translation ({DAS}-{FT}) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale—Filipino Translation ({RSES} – {FT}). Results showed that death anxiety and self esteem significantly differ between the two age groups with young Filipinos having a significantly higher death anxiety and lower self esteem. Moreover, the results indicated that death anxiety and self-esteem are significantly related among Filipino youths and older adults with self esteem explaining 67\% of the variance. Lastly, age is not a moderator for the two variables.

1218,Money and the fear of death: The symbolic power of money as an existential anxiety buffer,"According to terror management theory, people deal with the potential for anxiety that results from their knowledge of the inevitability of death by holding on to sources of value that exist within their cultural worldview. We propose that money is one such source capable of soothing existential anxiety. We hypothesize that death anxiety would amplify the value attributed to money, and that the presence of money would alleviate death anxiety. Study 1 indicated that individuals reminded of their mortality overestimated the size of coins and monetary notes. In Study 2, participants induced to think about their mortality used higher monetary standards to define a person or family as rich than those in the control condition. Study 3 revealed that people reminded of death desired higher compensation for waiving the immediate payment of money. Finally, Study 4 showed that priming participants with the concept of money reduced self-reported fear of death. We conclude that, beyond its pragmatic utility, money possesses a strong psychological meaning that helps to buffer existential anxiety.

Study 1 examined how scores on the Interpersonal Jealousy Scale relate to the Big 5 dimensions of personality. Seventy-one participants were administered the Interpersonal Adjective Scale Revised: Big Five version ({IASR}-B5; Trapnell \& Wiggins, 1990), the Interpersonal Jealousy Scale ({US}; Mathes \& Severa, 1981), and a shortened version of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Strahan \& Gerbasi, 1972). Study 2 examined how reactions to emotional and sexual infidelity relate to the Big-5 dimensions of personality. Seventy-seven participants were administered the {IASR}-B5 and Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, as well as infidelity scenarios that described either an emotional or sexual infidelity situation (Wiederman \& Kendall, 1999). Exploratory hypotheses suggesting that Neuroticism, Extraversion and Openness to experience might be predictors of: jealousy (Study 1), and reactions to a partner's commission of sexual and emotional infidelity (Study 2) were not confirmed. The Big-5 dimensions of personality were not related to jealousy scores or reactions to infidelity. The implications of these findings are discussed.

1220,How temporal distance changes novices' attitudes towards unconventional arts,"The authors suggest that, just like other attitudes, attitudes toward art may be malleable, and may thus also depend on situational factors. In particular, the authors propose that thinking styles vary within the situation and that an abstract versus concrete thinking style has an influence on attitudes toward conventional (e.g., Mona Lisa by da Vinci) versus unconventional (e.g., Fat Corner by Beuys) artworks. Construal Level Theory predicts that when people think about the distant future they automatically start thinking in a more abstract way, relative to when people think about the near future, which is supposed to elicit a concrete thinking style. In an experiment, the authors asked participants to think about their lives a year from now or tomorrow. Afterward, in an allegedly unrelated task, participants were asked to evaluate conventional and unconventional artworks. Results showed that participants that had thought about distant events and presumably thought more abstractly were more likely to include unconventional artworks into the category of arts than participants that had thought about near events, and thus presumably thought in more concrete terms. Implications for applied settings are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2017 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Schimmel, Katrin and Förster, Jens",0,,1219
1221,Universal worth: Construct and scale development,"Although research has demonstrated that narcissistic, contingent, and unsubstantiated forms of self-esteem correlate with undesirable behavior patterns, other researchers have searched for prosocial forms of belief in one’s worth. Universal worth is proposed as the belief that (a) one is valued by a deity; (b) one’s value is not contingent on success or failure; and (c) one is not valued by a deity more or less than others are valued. The Universal Worth Scale ({UWS}) was developed to measure this set of beliefs. Psychometric analyses showed that {UWS} scores were both internally consistent and temporally stable. Although scores on this scale were correlated with measures of constructs that were expected to be associated, the pattern of correlations suggests that {UWS} scores measure a distinct construct. Future research is suggested to explore universal worth in relation to sociometer theory and terror management theory, and within the continued search for prosocial foundations of self-worth.

1222,When school-shooting media fuels a retributive public: An examination of psychological mediators,"Despite evidence suggesting proactive responses to youth crime are advantageous, juvenile justice relies heavily on punitive practices. This discrepancy is in part affected by public preferences for retribution, which are skewed by sensationalized media portrayals of youth crime. This experiment (N = 174) explores how youth crime media exposure translates into retributive attitudes by testing the hypothesis that media portrayals of school shootings increase retributive attitudes indirectly through either dehumanization or mortality salience. Statistical analyses suggest that dehumanization mediates the relationship between school-shooting media portrayals and retributive attitudes toward crime-involved youths. To promote support of less retributive juvenile justice policies, advocates may benefit by focusing emphasis on humanizing elements of young offenders.

1223,"Patterns in response to chronic terrorism threats: A construct of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses among Israeli citizens","Israeli citizens are exposed to unpredictable and chronic terrorism threats that significantly jeopardize their personal sense of safety. The purpose of the present study is to present how Israeli discourse is structured with regard to emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to chronic terrorism threats and to understand the range of responses as well as map the risk and protective factors of this existential threat. Semistructured in‐depth interviews were conducted with 40 Israeli adults (22 women and 18 men). Qualitative analysis revealed three patterns of responses to ongoing terrorism: emotional, cognitive, and behavioral. Emotional responses include fear, worry, sense of empathy, and detachment. Cognitive responses include situational assessment and pursuit of solutions, the use of traumatic imagining, beliefs in fate and luck, and optimism. Behavioral responses include looking for information, alertness, and habituation. The findings also revealed another response, which combines cognitive and behavioral responses. Some of the responses are innovative and unique to the threat of terrorism. Mapping the responses revealed mental health risk factors, as well as protective factors that can help structure personal and national resilience. These findings have implications on the treatment and prevention of personal and social pathologies, and how to effectively cope with terrorism threats.

1224,The politics of fear: Is there an ideological asymmetry in existential motivation?,"A meta-analysis by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003) suggested that existential needs to reduce threat were associated with political conservatism. Nevertheless, some maintain that fear plays as prevalent a role on the left as the right. In an attempt to resolve this issue, we reviewed evidence from 134 different samples (N = 369,525) and 16 countries—a database 16 times larger than those previously considered. Although the association between fear of death and conservatism was not reliable, there was a significant effect of mortality salience (r = .08–.13) and a significant association between subjective perceptions of threat and conservatism (r = .12–.31). Exposure to objectively threatening circumstances, such as terrorist attacks, was associated with a 'conservative shift' at individual (r = .07–.14) and aggregate (r = .29–.66) levels of analysis. Psychological reactions to fear and threat thus convey a small-to-moderate political advantage for conservative leaders, parties, policies, and ideas.

1227,Finding meaning in death: Terror management among the terminally ill - Facing cancer and the fear of death: A psychoanalytic perspective on treatment.,"For most people, 'a good death' would come in one's sleep without pain, conscious awareness, or fear, after a long and satisfying life filled with meaning, value, and love. Unfortunately, death comes far too soon for many. For those diagnosed with terminal illness, death often follows arduous and painful medical treatments, isolated from the routines of normal living within the confines of a hospital. Terminal diagnoses force people to confront the reality of their own personal mortality not as an abstract problem for the distant future but as a pressing immediate concern. Although everyone knows they will someday die, the emotional impact of this awareness is typically blunted by a host of psychological defenses that defuse the potential for terror that this knowledge entails. Indeed, terror management theory, or {TMT}, posits that awareness of the inevitability of death has a profound influence on much of what people think, feel, and do, and is the primary impetus for the human pursuit of meaning, value, and love. In this chapter, the authors use {TMT} as a framework to consider how people cope with terminal illness, with a focus on factors that foster more and less adaptive coping with the many challenges resulting from such diagnoses.

1228,Six-year change in affect optimization and affect complexity across the adult life span: A further examination,"This study examines the life course of 2 independent components of adult affective development, 1 aimed at differentiation and complexity, the other aimed at optimization and positive emotional balance. These 2 components are predicted to have different developmental trajectories over the adult life span and to become related in a compensatory fashion under conditions of resource restrictions, such as those related to late life. Using individual growth curve estimation, we modeled 6-year longitudinal changes in the 2 components in a total sample of 388 individuals ranging in age from 15 to 88 years. As predicted, initial level of affect optimization was positively associated with age up to late middle age with a subsequent leveling off; individual rates of change were found to decelerate with age up to age 60 years and accelerate again around age 80 years. For affect complexity, initial level of affect complexity was positively associated with age up to age 45 years and negatively associated with age from then on, whereas individual rates of change were negatively associated with age, and this association tended to get stronger with age.

1229,The rupture and repair of the couple's communal body with prostate cancer,"Intimate partners' ability to adopt a 'we' outlook in relation to cancer has consistently been associated with optimal adaptation for couples. This investigation adds to the growing body of literature on dyadic coping and resiliency in couples through an in-depth examination of five well-adjusted couples' experiences with prostate cancer. Of specific interest were (1) how the experience of prostate cancer affected the couple's unique intersubjective identity, and how in turn (2) the couple's identity and relationship culture influenced their adjustment to cancer. An ethnographic mode of inquiry was adopted. Marital partners were interviewed together on two separate occasions with the intention of having them deepen their conjoint reflexive processing of their relationship. During the interviews, couples were asked to reflect upon and articulate their sense of themselves as a couple, their experience of 'we-ness' and shared identity, and the interaction between the illness and we-ness. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the grounded theory method. The grounded theory analysis yielded three main themes portraying the couples' experience of prostate cancer: (1) riding the vortex, (2) holding the communal body intact, and (3) invincibility and its underbelly. A more broad understanding to arise from this investigation was the notion of a 'communal body' and that couples participated in a shared corporeality, to which each partner's identity and sense of self was intricately tied. It is concluded that the intersubjective embodiment displayed by couples in this study was instrumental to the 'repair' of the communal body ruptured by prostate cancer.

The second objective was to study the role played by three mediators (emotions, death‐thoughts accessibility and self‐esteem) in the effects of mortality awareness on worldviews. The results revealed that different death reminders influenced different worldview dimensions and that emotions played a major role in the process.

Study 1a, 1b, and 1c yielded support for the symmetric effects of life and mortality salience on existential thoughts and worldview adherence. Furthermore, study 2 showed that contemplating life’s meaningfulness (versus meaninglessness) increased adherence to worldviews. Study 3 showed increased worldview adherence when contemplating life’s meaningfulness (versus meaninglessness), and provided additional evidence that the effect on worldview adherence was mediated by the appraisals of life’s meaningfulness. Finally, study 4 suggests that both reflecting on life and mortality leads to more worldview adherence under conditions of meaningful life appraisals.

A 2nd tradition has distinguished enhancement, the claiming of positive attributes, from denial, the repudiation of negative attributes. The 2 distinctions were evaluated jointly in 3 studies with a total of 937 undergraduates. Factor analyses showed that impression management items (both enhancement and denial) loaded together. Self-deception items split up: Enhancement items formed a 2nd factor, whereas denial items fell closer to the impression management factor. Of the 4 types, self-deceptive enhancement best predicted adjustment. These results clarify the constructs of enhancement and denial.

The results indicate that (a) higher effort and (bogus) excellence feedback increase preferences for vice rewards, but these effects are reversed or attenuated when the interchangeability of effort and income is implied; (b) willingness to pay in effort is greater for vices than virtues, but willingness to pay in income is higher for virtues; and (c) these effects are magnified among individuals with stronger (chronic or manipulated) guilt.

1235,Increases in generative concern among older adults following reminders of mortality,"According to terror management theory, people are motivated to protect themselves from the potential for anxiety resulting from awareness of mortality. It was hypothesized that increased concern for future generations, and the symbolic immortality this produces, may be particularly important to older adults when awareness of their mortality is increased. In two studies, older and younger adults’ generative concern was examined following mortality or control primes. As hypothesized, older adults’ generative concern and preference for pro-social over pro-self generativity were greater following reminders of mortality, whereas neither effect was observed among younger adults. For both studies, age differences were only observed when mortality salience was heightened; older and younger adults’ generative concern did not differ in control conditions. Results provide support for the hypothesis that younger and older adults differ in their responses to increased awareness of mortality and suggest that older adults respond to death reminders by adopting a more pro-social generative orientation.

1236,"Conceptualizing death in a worldview consistent, meaningful way and its effects on worldview defense","Research within terror management theory ({TMT}) has shown that when mortality is made salient, people subsequently engage in worldview defense: an increase in derogation of an individual who does not share their worldview along with an increase in veneration of an individual who does. Research has also shown that high levels of self-esteem (either dispositionally possessed or artificially enhanced) or legitimization of one's meaning supplying system (worldview) can attenuate the increase in worldview defense typically seen after mortality salience. Extending these findings, this research examined the hypothesis that motivating participants to consider their mortality in a manner that was personally meaningful and thus consistent with their particular worldview would also serve to assuage the need for worldview defense. The research reported below supported this reasoning. Specifically, participants with a Christian religious background who were given the typical mortality salience prime produced more positive evaluations of a Christian target and more negative evaluations of a Jewish target. However, participants with a Christian religious background who were presented with a meaningful mortality salience induction produced evaluations of the Christian and Jewish targets that did not differ. The implications of conceptualizing death meaningfully are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Rogers, Ross",1,,1235
1237,Perceived threats of terrorism and job performance: The roles of job-related anxiety and religiousness,"This study investigates the relationship between employees' perceptions of the threat of terrorism and job performance, as well as a potential mediating effect of job-related anxiety and a moderating effect of religiousness on this relationship. Multisource, time-lagged data from employees and their supervisors in Pakistan reveal that an important reason that perceived threats of terrorism diminish job performance is the anxiety that employees experience at work. Employees' religiousness buffers the negative effect of perceived threats of terrorism on job-related anxiety though, such that the relationship is mitigated when their religiousness is high. Finally, the results indicate the presence of moderated mediation: the indirect effect of perceived threats of terrorism on job performance is not as strong at higher levels of religiousness. In external environments in which terrorism presents a credible threat, organizations can therefore consider the religiousness of their employees as a resource for countering their anxiety.

1240,Nuclear accident reminders and support for nuclear energy: Paradoxical effect,"Three experiments investigated the impact of nuclear accident reminders on support for nuclear power, as a function of initial attitudes towards environmental protection. Data were collected in France, where nuclear plants produce approximately 80\% of the country's electricity, and where this is a highly politicized issue. Nuclear accident reminders were expected to lead individuals relatively low in environmental protection concern to paradoxically increase their support for nuclear energy (compared to a control condition), while those high in environmental protection concern were expected to decrease their support for nuclear energy. Taken together, results confirm the hypothesis for those weakly concerned with environmental protection. Also, this effect persisted for at least two weeks, effects of nuclear accident reminders were parallel to effects of mortality salience, and subliminal primes were as efficient as supraliminal primes, suggesting that the effect is unconscious. The processes that produce these effects and their policy implications are discussed.

However, polls had indicated that Barack Obama was generally perceived as the more compassionate of the two candidates. Thus, when compassionate values were made salient, death reminders motivated participants to uphold these values by significantly increasing their support for the more compassionate Barack Obama instead. The implications of these findings for terror management theory, the 2008 presidential election, and political endorsements are discussed.

1242,An Online Measure of Thought Suppression,"An online thought-suppression paradigm was developed to test predictions of ironic process theory. Participants concentrated on or suppressed a particular semantic category. Semantic activation was indexed by the latency to name words from the category. In Experiments 1 and 2, an analog intrusion was introduced while participants were trying to suppress the information. Results consistent with ironic process theory were observed using words with polar opposites in Experiment 1 and words without polar opposites in Experiment 2. To determine whether these effects were dependent on the analog intrusion, Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 1 without the intrusion. Concentration generated semantic activation, but suppression exacerbated this activation. The data imply that hyperaccessibility results from efforts to suppress, whereas the processes of thought suppression identified by ironic process theory require the presence of material inconsistent with a desired cognitive state.

Ss were also asked to mark whether and how many times they had experienced particular crises and traumatic events. Participation in an astrology course, but not in psychology or German courses, verified the participant's self-concept by increasing certainty of the self-descriptive attributes and the assumptions of self-control and perceived luck. In addition, interest in astrology was positively correlated with the number of personal crises, but not with the number of past traumatic events. The motivational mechanisms underlying astrological beliefs and the enormous popularity of astrology are discussed.

The present study extends this basic finding by examining reactions to contemporary' popular music, as moderated by authoritarianism. Participants assigned to a mortality salience or a control condition evaluated excerpts from four songs: two each from their o'wn and a foreign culture. Results revealed that mortality salience impacted the relative evaluation of the local versus foreign music only for individuals high in authoritarianism. Discussion focuses on mortality salience effects as a function of authoritarianism and musical preferences as embodying cultural values and worldviews.

1245,Terror management in childhood: Does death conceptualization moderate the effects of mortality salience on acceptance of similar and different others?,"This study inquires whether terror management mechanisms depend on the development of the concept of death. Children aged 7 and 11 yrs (N = 104) were exposed to death salient or nonsalient conditions and asked to rate their acceptance of in-group and out-group children. Death salience was manipulated by asking children to answer the Death Concept Scale before or after rating target stimuli. Children also answered a self-esteem scale, and their mothers completed a dogmatism scale. Death salience led to more acceptance of an in-group child and more rejection of an out-group child only among 11-yr-olds. Among 7-yr-olds, this manipulation led to a rejection of both in-group and out-group children. At both ages, these effects were mainly found among low self-esteem children and among children whose mothers scored high on the dogmatism scale. Results were discussed in the framework of terror management theory. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Florian, Victor and Mikulincer, Mario",1,,1244
1246,The effects of the relationship between terror management and depression on personal and spiritual meaning,"Terror management theory views depression as partly the result of a loss of faith in meaning of life (Simon, Harmon-Jones, Greenberg, Solomon, \& Pyszczynski, 1996). Moreover, individuals with depression have difficulty maintaining the cultural worldview component of their cultural anxiety-buffer (Hamilton, Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Cather, 1993; Pyszczynski \& Greenberg, 1992; Solomon et al., 1991). From the perspective of {TMT}, religion plays a protective role in terror management because it provides a basis for cultural worldviews and culturally derived self-esteem. It provides a sense of meaning in which human life and activities are valued and purposeful. It also provides a sense of security with the belief that they will live on in some form after physical death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between reminders of death and increases in personal and spiritual meaning. Consistent with previous literature that investigated personal meaning in relation to terror management, the findings of the present study suggest that encouraging individuals who were both depressed and non-depressed to defend their cultural worldview after being reminded of death leads them to view life as more personally meaningful. The findings from this study did not support the hypothesis that asking individuals, both depressed and non-depressed to contemplate their mortality leads to increases in spiritual meaning. Taking this research, one step further the role of anxiety and emotionality was investigated to determine whether participants became highly emotional and anxious after the manipulation, which in turn may have affected their ratings on the meaning scales. The current investigation found that non-depressed individuals who were in the control group reported more anxiety and emotionality than both the depressed and experimental groups. Taking into account both emotionality and anxiety, participants still rated their personal meaning similarly, such that those who were depressed who were asked to think about their death rated their levels of personal meaning higher than those depressed people who were in the control group. A thorough examination of these findings, with limitations and future directions is discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Glennon, Lauren R.",1,,1245
1247,Effects of early-life environmental stress on risk-taking tendency of adolescents in rural areas of Southwestern China,"The present study, drawing upon a developmentally oriented evolutionary perspective, investigated the association between early-life environmental stresses and adolescents' risk-taking tendency. Left-behind adolescents in rural China were particularly concerned. According to the life history theory, individuals who grow in the harsh and unpredictable environment, expect less for the future, are more likely to develop faster life history strategies. Limited empirical research, however, has been conducted on the psychological mechanism about how early-life environmental stresses influence adolescents' risk-taking. Therefore, the first goal of the current study was to identify the specific elements of environmental stresses that affect adolescents' cognitive and behavioral development, especially for the left-behind adolescents. The second goal was to construct and test a more synthesized model of how objective and subjective environmental stresses systematically influence adolescents' risk-taking in various domains. The third goal was to employ newly designed experimental manipulations to test the effect of the mortality clues and uncertainty clues on individuals' risk-taking decisions. Two survey studies and two experiments were conducted to address the research questions. In Study 1, we recruited 702 junior secondary school students to clarify the indexes of environmental stresses and to examine the validity of measures. The objective early-life environmental stresses were identified as including high mortality clue, high mobility clue, being left behind, and low socioeconomic status. The subjective stresses included high perceived-unpredictability and low parental-warmth. In Study 2, the questionnaires to measure the early-life environmental stresses and risk-taking tendency were administrated to 610 junior and senior middle school students in rural China. Among which, there were 318 left-behinds with neither parent around, 120 single-left-behinds living with either parent, and the rest 138 were non-left-behinds. The hypothesized model was tested with the data. Risk-taking tendency was compared among left-behinds, single-left-behinds, and non-left-behinds. It was found that objective early life environmental stresses directly or indirectly predicted adolescents' faster life history strategy, which was indicated by shorter future orientation and higher risk-taking tendency. Furthermore, subjective perception of environmental unpredictability and parental warmth respectively mediated the influence of socioeconomic status on adolescents' risk-taking. Biological sensitivity moderated the influence of mortality clue on adolescents' perceived parental warmth. However, sense of control failed to mediate the association between early-life environmental stresses and risk-taking tendency. Left-behind adolescents were found experiencing more mobility clue and mortality clue, and perceived more unpredictability and less parental warmth than both single-left-behinds and non-left-behinds. Although there was no significant difference found when comparing the general risk-taking tendency among the different left-behind groups, left-behinds were found to have the highest risk-taking tendency in the health/safety domain. Study 3 developed two new experimental paradigms to examine the effect of mortality salience and uncertainty salience on adolescents' risk-taking. The two experiments recruited 90 and 78 participants respectively. The results showed that adolescents manipulated with higher mortality salience appeared to be more risk-taking in the {BART} (Balloon Analogue Risk Task) paradigm (indicated by more exploded balloons and higher average number of pumps on each valid balloon) than those who were manipulated with physical hurt salience.

1249,Defenders of a Lost Cause: Terror Management and Violent Resistance to the Disengagement Plan,"Two studies, conducted 3 months before the Israeli pullout from the Gaza Strip and the Northern West Bank, examined whether reminders of death would lead right-wing Israelis to endorse violent resistance against the disengagement plan. More specifically, we hypothesized that this reaction would be particularly strong among participants high in denial--those who were unable to come to terms with the Israeli withdrawal. In Study 1 (N = 63), right-wing Israeli undergraduates were primed with death and asked to indicate whether they view violent resistance as legitimate and whether they would be willing to partake in such violence. In Study 2 (N = 42), Israeli settlers in the Gaza Strip completed a similar procedure as in Study 1. In both studies, primes of death led to greater support of violent resistance, but only among participants high in denial. The discussion examines the applicability of terror management theory to understanding real-life political crises.

1250,"Exploring the existential function of religion and supernatural agent beliefs among Christians, Muslims, Atheists, and Agnostics","Building on research suggesting one primary function of religion is the management of death awareness, the present research explored how supernatural beliefs are influenced by the awareness of death, for whom, and how individuals’ extant beliefs determine which god(s), if any, are eligible to fulfill that function. In Study 1, death reminders had no effect among Atheists, but enhanced Christians’ religiosity, belief in a higher power, and belief in God/Jesus and enhanced denial of Allah and Buddha. Similarly, death reminders increased Muslims’ religiosity and belief in a higher power, and led to greater belief in Allah and denial of God/Jesus and Buddha (Study 2). Finally, in Study 3, death reminders motivated Agnostics to increase their religiosity, belief in a higher power, and their faith in God/Jesus, Buddha, and Allah. The studies tested three potential theoretical explanations and were consistent with terror management theory’s worldview defense hypothesis. Theoretical implications are discussed.

Study 1 found reminders of death, followed by a distraction task and a self-prime, led to greater inclusion of heroes in the self. Study 2 found that writing about a personal hero, but not other’s heroes or acquaintances, led to lower death-thought accessibility after being reminded of mortality. Finally, Study 3 found that after death reminders, participants led to identify with a hero exemplifying traits of legacy and/or sacrifice showed lower death thought accessibility. Findings are discussed as generative for heroism research, informing a previously overlooked motivation underlying hero identification and the existential function of such identification.

1253,"«Eure Nahrung ess’ ich nicht, unsere Sprache sprech’ ich nicht» = 'I won’t eat your food, I don’t speak our language'","In the psychotherapeutic scheme of things, breastfeeding, feeding and being fed play a central role in the interaction between mother/father and child. Even in the earliest stages of its development, the baby can monitor and regulate the intake of food into its body. Accordingly, this process has a dual bridge function (contact between the baby’s outer and inner space, between primary objects and the baby) that depends on parental sensitivity, rhythmic coordination and parental intuition. Jaffe and colleagues (2001) extended the concept of synchronisation between mother/father and baby by including the significance of language. From clinical observation, we know that when there is an increase in the existential threat posed by a feeding disorder, the language of the parents withers and the language of the baby fails to develop, as if the dilemma could only express itself physically. Interestingly, the helper system also loses its power of symbolisation and becomes 'speechless' instead of perceiving and containing the raw affects of children and parents in the sense of Bion’s 'container-contained' model and placing them at the disposal of the children and their families in a 'digested' form.

1254,"The control of death and the death of control: The effects of mortality salience, neuroticism, and worldview threat on the desire for control","Two studies were designed to examine whether neuroticism would moderate the effect of mortality salience on desire for control. In Study 1, 162 medical students completed a neuroticism scale, contemplated their mortality or a control topic, and then completed a desire for control scale. Results indicated that those low in neuroticism evidenced an increase in desire for control following mortality salience whereas those high in neuroticism showed decreased desire for control. Study 2 used a 2 (neuroticism level) x2 (worldview threat) x2 (mortality salience) design to examine whether confident faith in a belief system is responsible for the increased desire for control among low neuroticism participants. 141 college students participated. Here results indicated that if participants scoring low in neuroticism were confronted with a threat to their worldview and were then reminded of their death, they showed reduced desires for control. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the relationship between neuroticism, desire for control, and terror management processes.

The current research examines the potential for conditions of creativity, a construct associated with open-mindedness, to promote a more explorative reaction to the threat of death thoughts. In Studies 1 and 2, thoughts of death or a control topic were activated and then participants engaged in either a creative or a control task. In Study 3, thoughts of death or a control topic were activated and then participants were presented with information suggesting that creativity is or is not culturally valued. After these conditions, social, intellectual, and environmental exploration (Study 1) and cultural worldview exploration (Studies 2 and 3) were measured. Results indicated that both engaging in a creative task and being informed that creativity is culturally valued facilitated exploration in response to thinking about death.

1256,"Cognitive dissonance and terror management:  Effects of induced compliance and morality salience on attitudes, mood and self-esteem","The current study examined the effects of discomfort from cognitive dissonance and mortality salience on attitudes, mood and self-esteem. Participants in the experimental conditions wrote a counterattitudinal essay designed to threaten a valued cultural belief. Half of the participants were given free choice to decline to write the essay, whereas half were not provided free choice. In addition, half of the participants filled out a questionnaire aimed at making their mortality salient or filled out a questionnaire unrelated to mortality. There was also a control group that did not fill out any questionnaire about mortality and did not write an essay. Cognitive dissonance theory predicts the experience of discomfort and attitude change toward the direction of the counterattitudinal behavior in the high choice conditions. Terror management theory predicts bolstering of the initial attitude and no observable change of mood when mortality is salient. Consistent with cognitive dissonance theory, attitude change and anxiety were expected in the high choice conditions. Attitude bolstering was expected only when choice was low and mortality was salient. Lowered self-esteem was expected in the mortality salience present/high choice condition due to unresolved discomfort from mortality salience. Results showed partial support for the hypotheses. The main prediction of the study was supported in that consistent with dissonance theory, attitude change toward the direction of the counterattitudinal behavior was found when both choice was high and mortality was salient. Although attitude bolstering did not occur in the mortality salience present/low choice condition, the data suggest that a floor effect might have prevented this from occurring. The results also suggest that partial misattribution of arousal from mortality salience to the dissonance manipulation increased the amount of attitude change and made participants more anxious. Self-reported anxiety was found only in the mortality salience conditions, suggesting that the choice manipulation alone may not have been powerful enough to produce anxiety even though it caused attitude change. Self-esteem was lowered in the mortality salience present/high choice condition, indicating that even though discomfort from the freely chosen counterattitudinal behavior was reduced via attitude change, participants still had unresolved discomfort from the mortality salience manipulation. Results are discussed in terms of the need to reduce discomfort arising from cognitive dissonance being a more immediate concern than dealing with discomfort from mortality salience. Cognitive dissonance and mortality salience are also discussed as being two independent sources of discomfort that are reduced at different times, using different mechanisms. Limitations of the current research are also discussed. The Results likely would have been more valid if direct physiological assessments were made, in addition to having had participants run individually, with the cover story and manipulation presented verbally.

The present research attempts to distinguish mortality salience from other forms of mortality awareness. Specifically, the authors look to reports of near-death experiences and posttraumatic growth which reveal that many people who nearly die come to view seeking wealth and possessions as empty and meaningless. Guided by these reports, a manipulation called death reflection was generated. In Study 1, highly extrinsic participants who experienced death reflection exhibited intrinsic behavior. In Study 2, the manipulation was validated, and in Study 3, death reflection and mortality salience manipulations were compared. Results showed that mortality salience led highly extrinsic participants to manifest greed, whereas death reflection again generated intrinsic, unselfish behavior.

When traumatic events lead to a breakdown of this system, people become vulnerable to recurrent bouts of anxiety, which leads to the various {PTSD} symptoms. We tested the {ABDT} hypothesis that trauma-exposed individuals with high levels of {PTSD} symptoms and risk factors for {PTSD}, such as high peritraumatic dissociation or low coping self-efficacy, do not respond to mortality reminders the way psychologically healthier people do. Whereas people typically respond to mortality reminders with increased worldview defense, indicating an intact anxiety buffering mechanism, we found that individuals with {PTSD} and associated risk factors do not display such responses.

To better understand the psychology of voice, the authors focus on Referent Cognitions Theory ({RCT}). It is argued that thus far {RCT} has not been used to explain the psychology of voice and that previous {RCT} research suffers from methodological problems and has been more outcome oriented than necessary. Two experiments resolve these problems and show that people react more strongly to procedures (especially no-voice procedures) when reference points are close as opposed to distant. These findings suggest that closeness of reference points plays an important role in the psychology of voice. The findings expand {RCT} in significant ways and indicate that insight into the role of reference points is essential for understanding the psychology of justice.

1260,"Perceived efficacy, conscious fear of death and intentions to tan: Not all fear appeals are created equal","Objectives: According to the terror management health model, conscious thoughts of death motivate productive health behaviours when the targeted behaviour is perceived as an effective route for mitigating the threat and removing death‐related thought from focal awareness. The present study thus examined whether messages manipulating the efficacy of a health behaviour moderate health outcomes when participants are presented with a fear appeal that makes death thought conscious. Design: A 3 (fear appeal: cancer vs. appearance vs. neutral) × 2 (delay vs. no delay) × 2 (effective vs. non‐effective) between‐subjects {ANOVA} was conducted. Methods: Beach patrons were randomly assigned to a cancer, appearance, or neutral‐threat fear appeal followed by a delay or no delay. Subsequently, they read messages highlighting the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of sun protection behaviours and reported their intentions to engage in those behaviours. Results: When fear appeals primed conscious thoughts of death, framing sun protection as ineffective decreased sun protection intentions relative to framing sun protection as effective. In contrast, fear appeals that did not consciously prime death, or appeals followed by a delay that allowed thoughts of death to fade from consciousness, did not interact with efficacy messages. Conclusions: The findings revealed that messages impacting sun protection efficacy moderated sun protection intentions only when death was conscious. The findings have implications for understanding the conditions that render certain fear appeals, and accompanying messages of efficacy, more influential than others.

1261,Normative Bias and Adaptive Challenges: A Relational Approach to Coalitional Psychology and a Critique of Terror Management Theory,"Adherence to ingroup ideology increases after exposure to death-related stimuli, a reaction that proponents of terror management theory ({TMT}) explain as a psychological defense against the uniquely human existential fear of death. We argue that existential concerns are not the relevant issue; rather, such concepts can be subsumed under a larger category of adaptive challenges that prime coalitional thinking. We suggest that increases in adherence to ingroup ideology in response to adaptive challenges are manifestations of normative mental representations emanating from psychological systems designed to enhance coordination and membership in social groups. In providing an alternative to {TMT}, we (1) explain why the theory is inconsistent with contemporary evolutionary biology, (2) demonstrate that mortality-salience does not have the unique evocative powers ascribed to it by {TMT} advocates, and (3) discuss our approach to coalitional psychology, a framework consistent with modern evolutionary theory and informed by a broad understanding of cultural variation, can be employed to help account for both the corpus of results in {TMT} research and the growing body of findings inconsistent with {TMT}'s predictions.

The current research approached this issue by creating a new measure of trait mindfulness. The construct defined within is end-state mindfulness and is a tendency to see things as they are moment by moment without any judgment. The newly created scale was validated in three studies. End-state mindfulness was negatively correlated with rumination, suppression, neuroticism, and better-than-average effect, but was not correlated with both positive and negative trait-affectivity; it also moderated negative emotional reactions in the context of mortality salience. End-state mindfulness was differentiated from the past measure of mindfulness in many aspects. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Noguchi, Kenji",1,,1261
1263,How does attachment style influence the brand attachment—Brand trust and brand loyalty chain in adolescents?,"This study contributes to the growing body of literature investigating how and why consumers form connections to brands by applying an attachment theoretical framework. According to the attachment theory, children develop internal working models of the reliability of others in the interaction with the primary caregiver(s). It can be assumed that this attachment style, which is conceptualized along two dimensions (secure–anxious and dependent–independent), not only influences intimate relationships in the long run, but may also play an important role in customer relationships. The author investigates the influence of attachment style along the brand attachment—brand trust and brand loyalty chain. The sample consists of 216 adolescents. The results derived from structural equation modeling ({SEM}) by proposing a non-recursive model show that the dependent–independent dimension of parental attachment style positively influences the corresponding dimension of brand attachment predisposition and is important for all of the constructs along the brand attachment—brand trust and brand loyalty chain. However, this is not the case with the secure–anxious dimension of parental attachment style. The secure–anxious dimension of brand attachment predisposition does, on the other hand, have a significant impact at least on brand trust. The results are discussed from an attachment theoretical point of view and corroborate the suppositions of Rindfleisch, Burroughs, and Wong (2009), who grounded their findings on terror management theory. Several possible implications of these results for the theory and practice of brand management and advertising, especially in the light of the gamification of advertising, are discussed.

1264,Mortality salience effects on selective exposure and Web browsing behavior,"Issue-related attitudes appear to drive individuals' selective Website browsing behavior, as a match between issue-related attitudes and Website content results in a greater number of page views. However, this relationship between content domain involvement and selective exposure is more complex than current theories hold, as the relationship emerges only when individuals are not primed to reflect on their mortality. Reminders of mortality, which are common in everyday life, lead to a defense motivation, which influences selective exposure behavior. In the control condition, issue-related attitudes predicted Website browsing, but under a mortality salience induction, these attitudes did not predict browsing behavior. Further, response latencies for the measure of individuals' attitudes toward the Website were influenced by their issue-related attitudes in the mortality salience condition but not in the control condition. The patterns of interactions produced in this experiment (N = 215) illustrate the relationship between dispositional and situational factors that drive selective exposure in an online context. The results also underscore the importance of using behavioral and process-dependent measures in addition to self-report measures.

1265,Toward a biological understanding of mortality salience (and other threat compensation processes),"Terror management theorists have proposed explanations of why death anxiety has a special status beyond other anxieties and furthermore argue that awareness of death elicits a defense mechanism that is qualitatively different from other sorts of threat-defense mechanisms. Our review suggests that the biological mechanisms through which thoughts of mortality motivate defensive behavior are not unique. Rather, we propose that an evolutionary primitive, biologically based anxiety system underlies mortality salience ({MS}) effects. Death anxiety may well be a mainspring of human activity, yet we suggest that a fundamental set of biological responses to uncertainty—and the processes associated with them—lie at the root of {MS} defenses. Our proposed motivational account of mortality salience provides a biologically informed, mechanistic elucidation of threat-compensation processes that may be applied to a wide range of social psychological phenomena.

Three studies investigated the effects of mortality reminders on reports of {PTG} or benefit findings among people living with life-threatening illness or their caregivers. 80 people living with {HIV} (Study 1), 164 breast cancer survivors (Study 2) and 50 family caregivers for a patient with Huntington Disease (Study 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental (mortality reminders) or control conditions. Across three studies, those exposed to mortality reminders reported lower {PTG} or benefit finding, compared to the controls. These effects were moderated by time elapsed since diagnosis: mortality reminders led to lower {PTG}/benefit finding among those who received the diagnosis more recently. The results provide an insight into the defensive character of {PTG}/finding benefits in illness and changes in the function of these beliefs over time elapsing since diagnosis.

1267,'In the wake of national trauma: Psychological reactions following the Charlie Hebdo terror attack': Correction,"Reports an error in 'In the wake of national trauma: Psychological reactions following the Charlie Hebdo terror attack' by Menachem Ben-Ezra, Elazar Leshem and Robin Goodwin (The American Journal of Psychiatry, 2015[Aug][1], Vol 172[8], 795-796). In the original article, there are some errors the corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-43017-023[/rid]). On Jan. 7, 2015, a terror attack targeted the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, leading to the death of 12 people. This attack was considered a national trauma that shook core beliefs and the French way of life. The association between mortality salience, reported shifts in political views, and sense of safety with psychological distress and posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) symptoms following national trauma is understudied. We conducted a nationally representative online panel survey (N51,982) in France 4 weeks after the Charlie Hebdo attack. Of 2,421 who clicked through to the survey, 1,982 (82\%) responded fully. In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks, we found evidence of elevated {PTSD} symptoms compared with historical norms in France. These results expand on previous study of 9/11 terrorist attacks. Clinicians should be aware that national trauma takes a toll on mental health in various ways, including mortality salience, shift in political views, and sense of safety.

1268,Reminders of mortality decrease midcingulate activity in response to others' suffering,"Reminders of mortality influence human social cognition, but whether and how reminders of mortality affect brain activity underlying social cognition remains unclear. To test whether increasing mortality salience modulates neural responses to others' suffering, we scanned healthy adults who viewed video clips showing others in pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging. One group of participants were primed to increase mortality salience and another group were primed with negative affect in terms of fear/anxiety. We found that perceiving painful vs non-painful stimuli in the pre-priming session activated the midcingulate/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex ({MCC}/{dMPFC}), bilateral anterior insula/inferior frontal cortex, bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex and left middle temporal gyrus. However, {MCC}/{dMPFC} activity in response to perceived pain in others was significantly decreased in the post-priming session by the mortality salience priming, but was not influenced by the negative affect priming. Moreover, subjective fear of death induced by the priming procedures mediated the change in {MCC}/{dMPFC} activity across the priming procedures. Subjective fear of death also moderated the co-variation of {MCC}/{dMPFC} and left insular activity during perception of others in pain. Our findings indicate that reminders of mortality decrease neural responses to others' suffering and this effect is mediated by the subjective fear of death.

1269,Things will get better: The anxiety-buffering qualities of progressive hope,"Terror management theory argues that people can cope with the psychological threat of their own death by bolstering faith in their cultural worldviews. Based on the notion that—since the Age of Enlightenment—belief or faith in progress has become one of the defining qualities of modern Western thinking, we expected that this belief serves as a buffer against mortality concerns. Three experiments were conducted to test the relationship between existential anxiety and belief in progress. Results of Experiment 1 show that mortality salience increased participants’ disagreement with an essay on the illusory notion of human progress. The same essay increased death-thought accessibility in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, belief in progress and mortality salience were manipulated. Results show that bolstering belief in progress buffered the effects of mortality salience on death-thought accessibility and diminished subsequent defensive reactions to a cultural worldview-threatening essay.

1270,Death Concerns and Other Adaptive Challenges: The Effects of Coalition-Relevant Challenges on Worldview Defense in the {US} and Costa Rica,"A relational approach to the psychology of coalitions suggests that certain stimuli that index adaptive problems for which marshaling coalitional support is a reliably adaptive response should elicit increased support of ingroup ideology. Studies from two cultures produced results consistent with this perspective. In Study 1, Costa Rican participants contemplating coalition-relevant scenarios (i.e. social isolation or the need to enlist the help of others in a cooperative task) increased support of ingroup ideology, but that participants contemplating a mortality-salient prime did not. Study 2 replicated these results in an American sample, and explored the moderating effects of individual variation in interdependence and chronic dangerous world beliefs on normative bias. These results suggest that the determining factor cross-culturally in the elicitation of worldview defense may not be mortality concerns per se, but rather the need for coalitional support.

1271,Attitudes toward animals: The effect of priming thoughts of human-animal similarities and mortality salience on the evaluation of companion animals,"Human attitudes toward nonhuman animals are complex and quite contradictory. They can range between extremely negative (animal cruelty) to positive (treating companion animals like human surrogates). Attitudes toward animals are especially negative when people think about human creatureliness and personal mortality. This paper investigates people's attitudes toward highly valued animals (companion animals). The research presented here tested whether companion-animal caregivers would respond to reminders of human creatureliness and mortality salience ({MS}) with more negative attitudes toward pets. Participants completed an online survey in which {MS} and human-creatureliness conditions were manipulated. Results showed that, under {MS}, even pet owners responded to reminders of human creatureliness with less positive attitudes toward the average pet. Thus, the effects observed in previous research extend to more popular animals, even among people with presumably positive attitudes toward animals.

1272,An edifice for enduring personal value: A terror management perspective on the human quest for multilevel meaning - The psychology of meaning.,"An important goal for understanding human meaning-making is to explain how (and why) meaning-making processes at both the macro and micro levels interrelate, as well as the underlying motivations they serve. With this broad goal in mind, the current chapter addresses the following questions: (a) What is meaning, and what is the connection between macro- and micro-level meanings? (b) Why do people need (these different types of) meaning? (c) How do people maintain meaning across these different levels? and (d) How does the pursuit of meaning interact with other psychological needs to influence people’s social behavior? To address these questions, we adopt an existential perspective grounded in terror management theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon 1986). The following topics are addressed: meaning as the infrastructure for sustaining personal value; the existential importance of feeling valued; macro-level strategies for maintaining meaning in the shadow of death; micro-level strategies for maintaining meaning in the shadow of death; perceptual shifts and the extraction of meaning; and implications for the interplay between the strivings for meaning and self-esteem.

1274,Of blood and death: A test of dual-existential systems in the context of prosocial intentions,"This article presents a study of a test test of dual-existential systems in the context of prosocial intentions. Ninety individuals were were recruited for the study and were randomly assigned to a death-reflection ({DR}), mortality-salience ({MS}), or control condition. Participants in the {DR} condition imagined the fire scenario described earlier and then answered four open-ended questions related to this experience. Participants in the {MS} condition answered two open-ended questions about death, whereas participants in the control condition answered two open-ended questions about a visit to the dentist. The participants in the {MS} and {DR} conditions did not differ in intentions to donate blood when the need for blood was high. However, when the need was low, participants in the {DR} condition demonstrated greater intentions to donate than did participants in the {MS} condition. The results were consistent with research demonstrating that {MS} generates an aversion to bodily fluids and organ donation as participants in the {MS} condition evidenced little intention to donate blood when the social need was low. Despite this aversion, participants in this condition showed increased intentions to donate blood when the sociocultural value of the behavior was salient.

1275,A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion,"From a terror management theory ({TMT}) perspective, religion serves to manage the potential terror engendered by the uniquely human awareness of death by affording a sense of psychological security and hope of immortality. Although secular beliefs can also serve a terror management function, religious beliefs are particularly well suited to mitigate death anxiety because they are all encompassing, rely on concepts that are not easily disconfirmed, and promise literal immortality. Research is reviewed demonstrating that mortality salience produces increased belief in afterlife, supernatural agency, human ascension from nature, and spiritual distinctions between mind and body. The social costs and benefits of religious beliefs are considered and compared to those of secular worldviews. The terror management functions of, and benefits and costs associated with, different types of religious orientation, such as intrinsic religiosity, quest, and religious fundamentalism, are then examined. Finally, the {TMT} analysis is compared to other accounts of religion.

Participants (N = 57) were randomized to either a self-affirmation or control condition before reading a government-sponsored antismoking leaflet and completing measures of message acceptance, intention, and self-efficacy. Participants' subsequent behavior (taking leaflets) was recorded surreptitiously. Results showed that the manipulation significantly increased message acceptance, intention and behavior, and that the effects of the manipulation on behavior were mediated through message acceptance and intention. The practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the possible use of self-affirmation manipulations to enhance the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions.

1277,Individual differences in coping with mortality salience in Germany vs Poland: Cultural world view or personal view defense?,"We investigated the influence of personality and culture on effects of mortality salience ({MS}) over cultural worldview defense ({CWVD}). We hypothesized that {CWVD} reactions to {MS} differ between Germany and Poland because of the higher conservatism of the latter country, and that they are moderated by action vs. state orientation. In this study German (N = 112) and Polish (N = 72), participants were exposed either to {MS} or to a control condition (dental pain). Punishment ratings to trivial offences and serious social transgressions were measures of {CWVD}. Results showed that social transgressions in both conditions were more strongly punished in Poland than in Germany. Additionally, compared to the control condition, under {MS} action oriented punished serious transgressions more strongly in Germany whereas state oriented punished serious transgressions more strongly in Poland. That is, the effects of {MS} on {CWVD} are moderated by personality and culture. We interpret the opposite pattern of punishment to serious social transgressions given by action and state orientedin in Germany and Poland, respectively, according to the higher emotional autonomy of action-oriented persons in either culture.

1278,Effects of worldview and mortality salience in persuasion processes,"Individual differences in media effects research have yielded a trove of insights into how media content can have varying effects. One such variable is worldview—a philosophy of life that enables a person to make sense of one's experience—but the notion has largely been unexamined in media effects research. A person's worldview can moderate the way a persuasive message is processed—sometimes in the opposite direction of that intended by communicators. Building on the construct of worldview and terror management theory, two experiments (N = 149 and N = 151) examined the question with worldview as a measured variable and mortality salience as a two-level factor. Worldview had a main effect on global evaluations of ads, as participants who tended toward a relativist worldview had lower evaluations of the ads and lower behavioral intentions, while participants who tended toward a positivist worldview had higher evaluations of the ads and higher behavioral intentions. Also, mortality salience was found to moderate participants' worldview, presumably making their worldview more accessible to exert a greater influence. The importance of worldview as a construct in media effects research, as well as theoretical implications for persuasion and terror management theory, are discussed.

Greenberg, 2003) to investigate people's reactions to the terrorist attacks of 09/11/01. According to the theory, people have a primary need to eliminate or reduce existential terror in response to such horrific events as 9/11. The authors obtained people's reactions to 9/11, an event in which the threat to one's existence was more authentic than those of previous events that were imagined. The authors of the present study collected data two weeks after 9/11 from young adults on a large university campus in the U.S. Midwest. The authors asked participants about their proximal and distal reactions to 9/11 and their reasons or motives for those reactions. The results indicated that the vast majority of participants' proximal reactions to 9/11 were shock and/or disbelief, whereas their distal reactions included performing altruistic or prosocial behavior, searching for meaning or value in life, seeking or sharing information, spending time in talking to others, and making bigoted remarks about Arab Muslims. The main finding was that interpersonal communication is an important means of eliminating or reducing existential terror.

1280,The Challenges of Experimental Existential Psychology: Terror Management or Meaning Management?,"Reviews the book 'Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology' (see record [rid]2004-21900-000[/rid]) by Jeff Greenberg, Sander L. Koole, and Tom Pyszczynski (Eds.). In recent times, the words 'meaning' and 'purpose' have become increasingly popular as times of uncertainty and chaos awaken in society a need for affirmation of their values and beliefs. This book attempts to extend scientific existential psychology by revealing the vitality and creativity of experimental social psychology in terms of existentialism. The introduction chapter addresses many issues concerning major existential concepts such as death, freedom, existential isolation, and meaninglessness. The remaining chapters focus mostly on unconscious defenses against the terror of death rather than with conscious striving for meaning and purpose. The reviewer primarily addresses the scientific merits of this book, and states that the information presented therein lacks breadth in terms of research, needing exploration into different research modalities than simply from personality and social psychology. The book explores Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) which states that humans have a universal inclination for self-preservation, and their capacity for self-awareness makes them terrified of their own mortality. Although the book promotes the merits of {TMT}, the reviewer suggests that a broader theory of Meaning Management Theory ({MMT}) would be more applicable to existential issues. The reviewer believes that the book relies too heavily on the tenets of {TMT}, leading to an unbalanced perspective. Because the book was written by social psychologists seemingly for other social psychologists, their approach is narrower than is needed for the true exploration of existential psychology, which should also embody cross-cultural and positive existential psychology. The reviewer believes that the suggested {MMT} would contribute to the development of world peace and a higher order of evolution, which is characterized by cooperation between diverse groups with different worldviews.

1281,Mortality salience motivates the defense of environmental values and increases collective ecoguilt,"In highlighting the potentially catastrophic effects of environmentally harmful behavior, proenvironmental campaigns may inadvertently induce what social psychologists call mortality salience. An uncomfortable awareness of one’s inevitable demise, mortality salience motivates individuals to act in line with important social values and to feel guilty when they fail to do so. Guilt, in turn, motivates proenvironmental behavior. It is unclear, however, whether individuals who do not value the environment are influenced by such appeals. The present research tests the conditions under which drawing attention to mortality increases environmental guilt (i.e., ecoguilt) among individuals who vary in their endorsement of proenvironmental values. We find that mortality salience increases ecoguilt when individuals who strongly endorse environmental values have those proenvironmental values made salient. In comparison, mortality salience does not influence ecoguilt for individuals who weakly endorse environmental values, regardless of whether environmental values are made salient.

1283,Death awareness and body–self dualism: A why and how of afterlife belief,"Belief in life after death offers potential comfort in the face of inevitable death. However, afterlife belief likely requires not only an awareness of death but also body–self dualism—the perception that the self (e.g., the mind) is distinct from the physical, undeniably mortal, body. In turn, we hypothesized that mortality salience ({MS}) should heighten afterlife belief only when dualism is facilitated. Study 1 found that {MS} increased belief for people high, relative to low, in trait mind–body dualism. In Study 2, {MS} only increased belief when people first wrote about their thoughts and personality, which a pilot study confirmed facilitated dualistic belief, relative to thinking about the physical self. Study 3 used the brain–computer interface technology to induce a dualistic experience: {MS} increased belief when participants accurately 'typed' without the use of their external body (i.e., no hands). Together, these findings support the position that mortality awareness and body–self dualism constitute a 'why' and 'how' of afterlife belief.

However, little if any empirical attention has been devoted to understanding the psychological reasons for such ambivalence. In this article we tried to fill this gap by using a conceptual analysis grounded in terror management theory. According to this perspective, because people are motivated to deny their similarity to animals (and the mortal vulnerability that entails), when such concerns are salient, they will react negatively to that which has the potential to highlight the creaturely aspects of humanity (i.e., pregnancy). In two experiments, priming the similarity between humans and animals led participants to respond more negatively to a pregnant compared to non-pregnant Demi Moore magazine cover (Study 1) and to perceive Gwyneth Paltrow as less competent when she was portrayed as pregnant (Study 2). We consider implications for understanding objectification and derogation of women.

It promotes profound understanding of the psychological underpinnings of the event and should be read by anyone who continues to wonder why Islamist terrorists 'hate' America. The introductory chapters on Terror Management Theory assert that culture, especially religious culture, serves as a psychological defense against 'the horrifying possibility that death entails the permanent annihilation of the self. And because the validity of such a defense is subconsciously or consciously threatened by religious beliefs contrary to one's own, everyone is inclined to be more or less intolerant of people who profess contrary beliefs. A person who is less intolerant tends, in contrast, to exhibit higher self-esteem, which the authors define in existential terms as 'the culturally based belief that one is a valued participant in a meaningful reality.'

However, if one’s worldview can offer protection, doubts concerning one’s worldview could undermine this protection. The current study investigated whether age, gender, religiousness, and religious doubt were associated with death anxiety. Using data from 635 younger, middle-aged, and older adults, a structural equation model with age, gender, religiousness, and religious doubt predicting death anxiety was tested. The model had a good fit (χ² (76) = 193.467, p {\textless} .001; {GFI} = .961, {CFI} = .976, {TLI} = .967, {RMSEA} = .049) and accounted for 12.3\% of the variance in death anxiety.

1287,Anxiety buffer disruption theory: A terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder,"We present anxiety buffer disruption theory ({ABDT}) and provide a review of current evidence regarding the theory. {ABDT} is an application of terror management theory to explain diverse reactions to traumatic events and the onset and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). It posits that {PTSD} results from a disruption in one’s anxiety-buffering mechanisms, which normally provide protection against anxiety in general and death anxiety in particular. The disruption of these mechanisms leaves the individual defenseless in the face of overwhelming anxiety, which leads to the major symptom clusters of {PTSD}: re-experiencing, hyper-arousal, and avoidance. According to {ABDT}, because of the disruption in their anxiety-buffering mechanisms, individuals with {PTSD} symptoms do not respond to mortality reminders in the defensive ways that psychologically healthier individuals do. We review four sets of studies conducted in four different cultures and with people who have experienced different types of trauma, which reveal this atypical response pattern and lend support to {ABDT}.

1288,Evidence for the specificity of control motivations in worldview defense: Distinguishing compensatory control from uncertainty management and terror management processes,"Research inspired by the compensatory control model ({CCM}) shows that people compensate for personal control threats by bolstering aspects of the cultural worldview that afford external control. According to the {CCM} these effects stem from the motivation to maintain perceived order, but it is alternatively possible that they represent indirect efforts to bolster distally related psychological structures described by uncertainty management theory (self-relevant certainty) and terror management theory (death-transcendence). To assess whether compensatory control processes play a unique role in worldview defense, we hypothesized that personal control threats would increase affirmation of cultural constructs that specifically bolster order more so than constructs that bolster distally related structures. The results of 5 studies provide converging support for this hypothesis in the context of attitudes toward diverse cultural constructs (Study 1: national culture; Studies 2 and 3: consumer products; Studies 4a and 4b: political candidates). Also supporting hypotheses, uncertainty salience and mortality salience elicited greater affirmation of identity- and immortality-conferring targets, respectively, compared to order-conferring constructs. Discussion focuses on the value of different perspectives on existential motivation for predicting specific forms of world view defense.

One prediction, based on evolutionary considerations, was that reminders of death increase the value of the present. Another prediction, based in part on construal level theory, was that reminders of death increase the value of the future. One-hundred eighteen participants thought about personal mortality or a control topic and then completed an inter-temporal choice task pitting the chance to gain \$50 now against increasingly attractive rewards three months later. Consistent with the hypothesis inspired by construal theory, participants in the mortality salience condition traded \$50 now for \$66.67 in three months, whereas participants in the dental pain salience condition required \$72.84 in three months in lieu of \$50 now. Thus, participants in the mortality salience condition discounted future monetary gains less than other participants, suggesting that thoughts of death may increase the subjective value of the future.

1290,The existential underpinnings of the cycle of terrorist and counterterrorist violence and pathways to peaceful resolutions,"This article provides a terror management theory perspective on the psychological factors that lead groups and individuals to endorse, promote, and engage in violent actions as part of political, ethnic, and religious conflicts. This perspective provides an empirically-based, theoretically-driven approach to understanding the ways in which ideological, nationalistic, and religious beliefs interact with historical events and concrete complaints to lead people to accept, condone, or participate in terrorist activities. Research provides convergent evidence suggesting that many of the same psychological factors are at work in the minds of people on opposing sides of such conflicts. This suggests that the factors driving people toward terrorism are the same as those which drive people toward extreme counterterrorism measures that often create substantial collateral damage which commonly helps terrorists grow broader support for their causes and increase recruitment. After describing processes that promote this cycle of violence, we discuss theory and research that suggests pathways through which violent responses to such conflicts can be discouraged.

1291,Unconscious death-thoughts as a mediator between death awareness and self-forgiveness,"Terror Management Theory assumes self-esteem is an important psychological mechanism in unconscious avoidance of death-related anxiety. I posited that Terror Management Theory encapsulates existential motivations for self-forgiveness; that is, I suggested self-forgiveness might buffer self-esteem reductions secondary to guilt and shame. Indeed, accumulated research supports people strive for self-forgiveness to cope with the detrimental effects guilt and shame have on wellbeing through a dual-process of interpersonal (i.e., perceived forgiveness, conciliatory behaviors) and intrapsychic (i.e., perceived offense severity, effort) means. Reasoning from existing Terror Management and self-forgiveness theory and research, the current study sought to establish a meditational link among death awareness, unconscious death-thoughts, and self-forgiveness. The study tested (1) if unconscious death-thoughts mediate the relation between increased death awareness and selfforgiveness (i.e., mediation), (2) if this mediated relation is moderated by offense severity, conciliatory behaviors, perceived forgiveness, or effort (i.e., moderated-mediation), and (3) if these relations are most observable for people who freshly experience death awareness relative to dental pain (i.e., interactional moderated-mediation). The current study tested these hypotheses with a randomized post-test only blind comparison-group design. In order to clarify the mediation and moderated-mediation, there also was a measurement-of-mediation and moderation-of-process procedure. Specifically, after rec lling recent interpersonal offenses and filling in related measures, participants wrote about either inevitable death (n = 112) or dental pain (n = 113), spent time filling in distraction measures, and then reported their levels of selfforgiveness. The results of bootstrapped path analyses, one-way {ANOVA}, and one-way {MANOVA} did not support the mediation, moderated-mediation, or interactional moderatedmediation hypotheses. I conclude with implications for theory, research, and practice. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","{McConnell}, John M.",1,,1290

1293,Editorial,"Evidence-based practice, of course, is the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise applied to the client’s context and characteristics including gender, culture (including work environment), physical and mental abilities, and age. One additional factor is often overlooked: Evidence-based practice requires clinical skill to be practiced properly. Unfortunately, in the rush to embrace evidence based practice, practitioners struggling to do their best to match their treatment approaches with the special circumstances of their clients have lost sight of the importance of the risk of 'being tyrannized by evidence.' As the field of traumatology—particularly the newest component that examines the psychobiological and psychosocial consequences and treatments of trauma—matures, it is extremely important to consider the context of each traumatic event. The context includes, of course, the particular subjective perspective of the traumatized. The context also includes those who are assisting the traumatized, including the professionals being paid for their services. These practitioners must be held to a higher standard, as the articles in this issue illustrate. Evidence-based practice, though, includes judging the utility of the mode of assistance in light of both the existing evidence of effectiveness and also the extraordinary complexity of the context in which the services are being delivered. Let us be charitable in our judgments accordingly. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Figley, Charles R.",0,,1292
1294,The protective identity: Evidence that mortality salience heightens the clarity and coherence of the self-concept,"Research guided by terror management theory has shown that self-esteem provides a buffer against mortality concerns. The current research extends the theory to examine whether clarity and coherence in the structure of the self-concept serve a terror management function independent of enhancing self-esteem. Specifically, five studies tested whether mortality salience ({MS}) heightens diverse tendencies to clarify and integrate self-relevant knowledge, especially in individuals predisposed to seek structured knowledge. {MS} led high, but not low, structure-seeking participants to prefer coherent (Study 1) clearly-defined (Study 2), and simply organized (Study 3) conceptions of their personal characteristics. Also, {MS} led high structure-seeking participants to prefer causal coherence in recent experience (Study 4) and meaningful connections between past events and their current self (Study 5). Supporting the specificity of these effects on self-concept structuring, {MS} increased self-enhancement in Studies 1, 4, and 5 but these effects were not moderated by preference for structured knowledge.

1295,"The affect heuristic, mortality salience, and risk: Domain‐specific effects of a natural disaster on risk‐benefit perception","We examine how affect and accessible thoughts following a major natural disaster influence everyday risk perception. A survey was conducted in the months following the 2004 south Asian Tsunami in a representative sample of the Swedish population (N = 733). Respondents rated their experienced affect as well as the perceived risk and benefits of various everyday decision domains. Affect influenced risk and benefit perception in a way that could be predicted from both the affect‐congruency and affect heuristic literatures (increased risk perception and stronger risk‐benefit correlations). However, in some decision domains, self‐regulation goals primed by the natural disaster predicted risk and benefit ratings. Together, these results show that affect, accessible thoughts and motivational states influence perceptions of risks and benefits.

1296,Mortality salience and morality: Thinking about death makes people less utilitarian,"According to the dual-process model of moral judgment, utilitarian responses to moral conflict draw on limited cognitive resources. Terror Management Theory, in parallel, postulates that mortality salience mobilizes these resources to suppress thoughts of death out of focal attention. Consequently, we predicted that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Two experiments corroborated this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that utilitarian responses to non-lethal harm conflicts were less frequent when participants were reminded of their mortality. Experiment 2 showed that the detrimental effect of mortality salience on utilitarian conflict judgments was comparable to that of an extreme concurrent cognitive load. These findings raise the question of whether private judgment and public debate about controversial moral issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, since these issues (e.g., assisted suicide) often involve matters of life and death.

1297,Cognitive and motivational effects on variety seeking,"Variety seeking is a behavioral tendency that can be observed in various consumption situations. This thesis investigated the effects of three factors on variety seeking. These factors exert their effects on the tendency to choose variety via motivational or/and cognitive mechanisms. The first essay examined the cognitive effects of processing style on variety seeking. One experiment demonstrated that when people were primed to process information globally, they were more likely to choose variety than when they were primed with a local processing style. This finding opens a fruitful avenue to investigate how variety seeking may be influenced by factors that can alter individuals' processing style. In the second essay, I explored the motivational effects of social exclusion on variety seeking. Two experiments showed that social exclusion, regardless of the specific way it is experienced, increased choice of variety. This effect was driven by ostracized people's motivation to regain control. It is observed only when participants chronically have a need for control and when choosing variety can help fulfill the goal of restoring their feeling of control. In addition, it only occurs when individuals feel unable to restore their lack of social control directly, and must resort to means of doing so in other, nonsocial domains. Moreover, this essay showed that social exclusion had divergent effects on variety seeking and uniqueness seeking. The third essay examined how motivational and cognitive effects interact on variety seeking. Specifically, it studied the effects of mortality salience, which not only can induce motivation to defend against death anxiety but also activate death-related semantic concepts. Four experiments showed that inducing thoughts about one's own death decreased the variety of participants' choices in an unrelated multiple-choice decision situation, whereas activating semantic concepts of death increased it. Moreover, inducing cognitive load decreased the motivational effect of mortality salience, leading its cognitive influence to predominate. The motivational effect of mortality salience was apparently driven by a desire for stability, leading to the avoidance of unfamiliar stimuli. In contrast, its cognitive, semantic effect was mediated by its impact on the use of a global processing style. The cognitive effects of mortality salience occur regardless of how it is induced, but its motivational influence occurs only when death anxiety is experienced as a result of thinking about one's own death.

1298,"Defending a coherent autobiography: When past events appear incoherent, mortality salience prompts compensatory bolstering of the past's significance and the future's orderliness","Drawing on terror management theory, we propose that maintaining a coherent autobiography protects the individual from mortality concerns by imbuing experience over time with significance and order. Two studies test whether mortality salience combined with a threat to autobiographical coherence (induced by an alphabetical organization of past events) prompts compensatory bolstering of the significance and orderliness of temporal experience. In Study 1, whereas exclusion-primed participants led to organize past events alphabetically perceived their past as less significant, mortality salient participants showed a compensatory boost in perceptions of their past’s significance. In Study 2, mortality salience and an alphabetic event organization led participants high in personal need for structure to parse their future into clearly defined temporal intervals. This research is the first to experimentally assess the role of existential concerns in people’s motivation to defend the significance and structure of their temporal experience against threats to autobiographical coherence.

1300,Beyond death’s (and conception’s) door: The unsettling limitations of incarnate existence,"The psychological effects of contemplating one’s death have received much empirical attention, but the impact of thinking about one’s conception—the other temporal endpoint of physical existence—has not. Across three experiments, reflecting on conception or death (vs. a neutral topic) led to increased framing of sexual reproduction as miraculous and sacred, intensified belief in discarnate immortality, and a greater desire to experience a discarnate state that offered no direct assurance of literal immortality. Thinking about death uniquely evoked greater anxiety as well as greater desire for an experience that offered assurance of literal immortality, congruent with the tenets of terror management theory. Nevertheless, the parallel effects evoked by reflecting on conception and death also suggest that both amplify the aversive salience of the limitations inherent to physical existence, such that people respond by seeking experiences and adjusting attitudes/beliefs to divert attention from the physical body.

1301,Making sense of life: The existential self trying to deal with personal uncertainty,"This article is about how people make sense of life and focuses on one core threat that may play a pivotal role in people’s lives as existential meaning makers: personal uncertainty. Personal uncertainty is defined as the aversive feeling that you experience when you feel uncertain about yourself. Drawing on an uncertainty management perspective, it is hypothesized that cultural world views may provide a means to cope with personal uncertainty and that this may explain why under conditions of personal uncertainty people may respond especially positively to events that bolster their cultural norms and values and particularly negatively to persons and events that violate these norms and values. Findings are reviewed that support the uncertainty management model’s predictions. Furthermore, the uncertainty management model may explain why terror management theory is not always about terror, but (at least partly) about personal uncertainty. Finally, conceptual implications, conflicting findings, and loose ends are noted, and testable hypotheses are formulated, which may further insight into the psychological processes pertaining to sense-making, worldview defense, and self-regulation.

1302,Taking a turn toward the masculine: The impact of mortality salience on implicit leadership theories,"The present research investigates the influence of subtle death-related thoughts (i.e., mortality salience) on people's images of effective leaders (i.e., their implicit leadership theories [{ILTs}]). We test the prediction that mortality salience will change the content of these implicit theories to be more gender stereotypical such that individuals will conceive of effective leaders in a significantly more masculine, or agentic, manner. To test this prediction, we assessed the communal and agentic components of participants' {ILTs} after they were presented with a mortality salience or control manipulation. Results show that priming individuals to think about their mortality with two open-ended questions resulted in a significant shift in their {ILTs} such that an effective leader is described in significantly more agentic terms compared to the control condition. This masculine shift in people's {ILTs} was demonstrated in both women and men, and mortality salience did not influence perceptions of effective leaders' communal traits. This work contributes to research on gender bias in leadership, {ILTs}, and terror management theory and has implications for female leaders.

As {MS} leads to conformity and narrow-mindedness, we predicted that {MS} would lead to lower creativity, unless creativity itself could lead to leaving a legacy and thus symbolic immortality. We show that this pattern holds (Experiment 1), but only when creativity is socially valued (Experiment 2). Finally, especially individualistic people are more creative under {MS} when they can leave a legacy than when they cannot, and high originality predicts subsequent accessibility of death thoughts (Experiment 3).

1304,The culture of condoms: Culturally grounded variables and their association with attitudes to condoms,"Objective: To examine attitudes toward condoms and their association with culturally grounded beliefs among young South African adults. Methods: A questionnaire survey undertaken in three different locations (urban, rural, and mixed), including 1100 participants, and implementing both a cross-validational and a bootstrap multivariate design. Outcome measures were intention to use a condom at next sex and condom salience (i.e., confidence in the protective value of condoms). Culturally grounded predictors included traditional beliefs about illness, beliefs in ancestral protection, endorsement of {AIDS} myths, and mortality salience ({CONTACT}). Results: Participants exhibited strong endorsement of indigenous beliefs about illness and ancestral protection, and moderate endorsement of {AIDS} myths. Participants who viewed condoms as important for {HIV} prevention were more likely to show strong endorsement of both beliefs in ancestral protection and traditional beliefs about illness. Participants who strongly endorsed {AIDS} myths viewed condoms as less important and also had lower intention to use scores. Finally, participants who knew {HIV} positive people, and/or people who had died of {HIV}-related illnesses, had higher condom salience and higher intention to use scores. Conclusions: Results challenge the assumption that culturally grounded variables are inherently adversarial in their relationship to biomedical models of {HIV} prevention, and offer insights into how traditional beliefs and cultural constructions of {HIV}/{AIDS} might be used more effectively in {HIV} education programs.

1305,Managing terror when self-worth and worldviews collide: Evidence that mortality salience increases reluctance to self-enhance beyond authorities,"Terror management theory posits that one's self-esteem and worldview operate jointly to manage mortality concerns. Accordingly, past research shows that mortality salience ({MS}) increases self enhancement and worldview defense. The current research is the first to examine {MS} effects when self-enhancement threatens to undermine aspects of the worldview, in this case the credibility and status of worldview-representative authorities. {MS} led to reluctance to self-enhance following positive personality test feedback when the test was judged negatively by institutional authorities (Study 1a), as well as unwillingness to contradict self-esteem threatening feedback sanctioned by authorities (Study 1b). Mortality salient participants also rated themselves higher on valued dimensions unless it meant viewing themselves more positively than their parents (Study 2) and admired political icons (Study 3). Taken together, these results show that {MS} increases self-enhancement unless doing so challenges important representatives of the worldview. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

1306,"Desire in the face of death: Terror management, attachment, and sexual motivation","Four studies examined the impact of mortality salience ({MS}) on sexual motivation. In Studies 1–3, participants were primed with death-related thoughts and then rated their desire to engage in sex in different contexts. Study 4 included an assessment of reasons for engaging in sex. Results showed that {MS} increased the desire for romantic sex, regardless of gender, and the desire for casual sex among more avoidant men. Sexual desire was fueled by distinct patterns of motives among highly anxious and avoidant people. These findings suggest that the variety of meanings sexual behavior has for different people may explain why, in some cases, sexual behavior may function as a defense against mortality concerns, whereas in other cases, it may exacerbate threat.

1307,Motivations for indoor tanning: Theoretical models - Shedding light on indoor tanning.,"This chapter reviews the literature applying health behavior theories to indoor tanning. Few studies have tried to fit full versions of health behavior models to indoor tanning. Theoretical models from the family of theories referred to as the reasoned action approach (e.g., theory of planned behavior, behavioral alternative model, prototype willingness model, etc.) have been most commonly used to study indoor tanning. Results indicate that these models fit indoor tanning data moderately to extremely well. Two lesser known models, problem behavior theory and the terror management health model, have also demonstrated a reasonable fit. Two other common models, the health belief model and social cognitive theory, have never been fully tested with indoor tanning. However, key constructs from these models (e.g., perceived susceptibility and threat, modeling) have been used to understand indoor tanning. Empirical research conducted represents a solid start toward developing strong, comprehensive models of indoor tanning that can guide intervention efforts. This initial work needs to be expanded by conducting longitudinal studies and by including a broader age range in studies because the majority of existing work has focused on young adults. Incorporating findings related to tanning dependency, peer group affiliation, media influences and other constructs into these foundational models will also improve our understanding and ability to develop efficacious interventions to reduce engagement in this health risk behavior.

Participants wrote about the emotions and events surrounding their own death ({MS}), or a control topic, and linguistic content in the essays was related to levels of self-reported fundamentalism of the essay authors. Higher levels of fundamentalism were associated with responses to {MS} that were less cognitively complex, contained more positive emotion, and were more future and socially oriented. There was virtually no relationship between fundamentalism and linguistic properties of writings about a control topic. The discussion centers on the influence of fundamentalist belief systems on attitudes toward death and suggests how the current results might aid future study of religious belief and of terror management.

1309,Theory and methods for studying the influence of unconscious processes: Illustrations from attachment and terror management research - Handbook of contemporary psychotherapy: Toward an improved understanding of effective psychotherapy.,"In this chapter, we review two psychodynamic theories that provide insights into basic human motivations operating at both conscious and unconscious levels to influence behaviors of concern to clinical practitioners. These range the gamut from dysphoric states such as depression, phobias, or anxiety; dysfunctional behaviors in interpersonal or professional settings; and substance abuse and other coping mechanisms to compulsive behaviors such as shopping, gambling, and others. We first review modern experimental methods of studying unconscious influences on behavior. We then review each of the two theories in turn—Bowlby's (1969/1982) attachment theory and 'Terror Management Theory' (Greenberg, Pyszcnzyski, \& Solomon, 1986)—and summarize theory-based research illustrating the influence of the activation of relevant unconscious constructs on clinically relevant thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Attachment theory and terror management theory offer two psychodynamic perspectives on human thinking, feeling, and behavior that have proven imminently testable in the laboratory. Each posits the existence of motives, emotions, self- and other schemas, and strategies for coping that operate in and outside the realm of conscious awareness to drive a wide range of theoretically relevant thoughts, feelings, and overt behaviors. In each case, correlational research has revealed associations between the core constructs of the theory—such as death anxiety or attachment style—and theoretically predicted related mental or behavioral processes and outcomes; and laboratory priming research has confirmed the causal relationship of the hypothesized constructs operating in and outside conscious awareness (via supraliminal vs. subliminal priming methods) to relevant processes and outcomes. Further, in each case, causal relationships between priming of the relevant constructs, such as felt security, insecurity, or mortality salience, and exacerbation or amelioration of clinical symptoms have been demonstrated.

1310,"When one is dying, will h/she buy domestic products? Exploring whether, why and when the exposure to death-related information will (not) increase domestic brand choices","Death exposure sells newspapers. Each of us is inevitably exposed to death everyday (e.g., read newspapers, listen to radios, etc.). Though data from consumers of western developed countries showed that death exposure could increase preference for the domestic products to foreign products, up to date, no research examined whether death exposure would drive consumers from developing countries to choose domestic products. Research on terror management theory argues that death exposure can trigger two defensive mechanisms: supporting cultural worldviews and seeking for self-esteem, while recent research further finds that consumers from developing countries tend to prefer buying foreign products to enhance their self-esteem and to seek for high social status. Thus we expect that when consumers from developing countries are exposed to death-related information, they may simultaneously adopt two defensive mechanisms: to choose foreign products to enhance their self-esteem, and to choose domestic products to support their cultural worldviews. The authors examined which of these two competitive mechanisms would prevail, finding that the cultural worldview defensive mechanism excelled, death exposure forced consumers from developing countries to choose domestic products. Further, recent research on {TMT} reported that death exposure triggered a strong patriotism emotion among consumers from western developed countries, which in turn resulted in their higher preference for the domestic products. The authors argue and find that feelings of control, rather than patriotism emotions mediate the effect of death exposure on domestic product choices of consumers from developing countries. More important, past research did not examine when death exposure would not increase domestic product purchase, the authors investigate this issue and find that after priming consumers' warm interpersonal support, they will no longer choose domestic products. The authors conduct two experiments to examine whether, why and when death exposure will (not) increase domestic product choices of consumers from developing countries via changing ways of manipulating death exposure and altering product categories. Experiment 1 investigates whether and why death exposure (will) affect consumers' product choices, finding that death exposure lowers participants' feelings of personal control, thus to compensate for such a loss they choose domestic products with the hope that domestic country ingroups can help them regain agency control. After controlling for the influence of patriotism emotions, magnitude of fear death and ingroup identification, the mediating role of low feelings of personal control are still found to be significant. In Experiment 2, the authors further examine when death exposure will have no impact on consumers' domestic product choice, finding that after strengthen consumers' belongingness needs (via manipulating supportive interpersonal relationships), consumers encountering with death fear will not choose domestic products any more. The article theoretically enriches and advances consumer research in the domain of terror management and country-of-origin stereotypes, and managerially provides useful implications on organizational management in general, and on domestic brands' advertising, social responsibility activities and new product innovation in particular.

In the current studies, we examined a complementary prediction that providing people with an alternative source of security would reduce their need to defend against insecurity, resulting in lower endorsement of the anxiety-reducing political attitudes. Results supported this prediction, showing that security primes buffered or reversed the effects of insecurity and threats on political attitudes and leadership preferences. Participants primed with attachment security showed reduced liking of a strong, charismatic political candidate (Study I), and lower support for the Iraq war, even in the face of mortality reminders (Study 2). We discuss these findings in the context of research on motivated social cognition, political psychology, and the effects of security and insecurity on attitudes and behaviors.

1312,Oncologists and death: From a heroic angle of repose,"This study is an exploration of the heroic role of the oncologist traditionally perceived as savior in a culture that demands a cure. The doctor is central to healthcare and training begins with a scientific outlook concentrated on diagnosing, treating and curing illness. This dissertation uncovers the shadow side of a culturally, scientifically and institutionally inspired role under the expectations of postponing death. Through the theoretical perspective of Becker's Pulitzer Prize winning work on the denial of death and James Hillmans archetypal psychology, both challenging and rewarding aspects of the oncologist's role are explored. Themes emerged from open ended semi-structured interviews with 12 oncologists. Interpretive phenomenological analysis methodology reveals themes describing the heroic stance or an angle of repose that must restrain cancer and frequently death. A hermeneutic approach was used to understand how these behaviors are transferred to patient care or counter transferred back to the oncologist possibly affecting patient outcomes. Using these two theorists, their depth psychological perspectives address both the literal as well as the psychological experience of death. The heuristic component of research incorporates the personal experience of the researcher who has worked more than 30 years as an oncology nurse/nurse practitioner. Ultimately, through Hillman's philosophy, this exploration begins to reveal the soul and its healing relationship with death. It is possible as some of the data depicts, that our own unacknowledged personal death anxiety is forced into the role of ultimate destroyer as Solomon's terror management theory might suggest. This research reveals the dire need to increase consciousness around a taboo subject and reclaim death as a more natural part of our lives. Data suggest that our beliefs and attitudes towards death are often more culturally shaped than by our own personal resolve. Although not a focal point of this study, suggested are important implications for oncology nurses providing insight into how their patient care might be influenced.

1313,Person-centered suicide prevention - Psychology and geriatrics: Integrated care for an aging population.,"This chapter is divided into three main sections. In the first, 'Biomedicalism Misdirected,' we explain why unfettered biomedicalism is poorly suited both for suicide prevention and for the practice of primary care medicine. Unsurprisingly, biomedically oriented interventions have not been shown to reduce suicide mortality in older adults. Not only have these interventions generated opportunity costs, they have also led to unintended psychological harm that, we theorize, are largely byproducts of two cognitive heuristics (or problem-solving strategies) inherent in biomedicalism, essentialism and focalism. In the second section, 'Biomedicalism Retained,' we offer a hypothesis that seeks to explain why person-centered care has not gained traction in medicine. We suggest that economic arguments, while compelling, have limited explanatory power. Moreover, economic theories of unfettered biomedicalism seem to presume, incorrectly, that clinicians (or their employers) are motivated primarily or exclusively by money. By integrating two psychological theories, terror management theory ({TMT}) and self-determination theory ({SDT}), we offer a hypothesis that is premised on a more nuanced view of human motivation. Moreover, unlike economic theories, our hypothesis can explain the implications of essentialism and focalism for the clinician's cognitive activity. In the third section, 'Humanism Reimagined,' we discuss how developments in information technology can improve person-centered suicide prevention. Whereas the prevailing biomedicalism prioritizes the treatment of mental disorders, humanistic person-centeredness prioritizes the relief of patient suffering by mitigating precisely those cognitive heuristics, essentialism and focalism, that we theorize make it difficult for clinicians to bear and respond to patient suffering.

1315,Toward a comprehensive understanding of existential threat: Insights from Paul Tillich,"Experimental existential psychology ({XXP}) empirically investigates how people's motives for meaning and personal value influence their lives, and how symbolic self-awareness undergirds these motives and experienced threats to their fulfillment. The authors attempt to synthesize the insights that have already accumulated from {XXP}, and simultaneously point to a new direction for this field. Researchers have debated whether there is a 'core threat' in human experience, but the authors propose that a more fruitful direction for research is to examine the simultaneous independence and interdependence of different existential threats. Paul Tillich's (1952) theory of existential threat is put forward as one model for understanding how a core threat to non-being (mortality) can nevertheless be experienced in proximally different forms, in terms of anxieties about meaninglessness or condemnation of the self. In addition to presenting Tillich's theory, the authors make several concrete suggestions for how future research in {XXP} should proceed.

1316,"Working with older adults: Predictors of attitudes towards ageing in psychology and social work students, faculty, and practitioners","The Australian population is experiencing a rapid ageing of the population, and as such, an increased need for gerontological practitioners in the helping professions will continue to grow. Terror management theory ({TMT}), which was used to frame this study, posits that because of the fact that humans are aware of their own mortality, they are compelled to avoid the anxiety associated with it. Personal ageing and interaction with older adults may be reminders of the unavoidable decline and death that faces us all. The purpose of this study is to examine comfort in spending time with older adults amongst students, academic teaching staff, and practitioners in the fields of psychology and social work. We sought to determine if {TMT} helped predict fear of being with older adults. Ageism, contact with older adults, and known demographic factors associated with attitudes towards older adults were also examined. Hierarchical multiple regression explained nearly 46\% of the variance in comfort with older adults and indicated that fear of ageing, positive ageism, negative ageism, contact with older adults, and sex were significant predictors. Educational efforts aimed at addressing beliefs about ageing and older adults may contribute to further comfort in working with older adults.

Saving can relieve future-related anxiety and provide people with a sense of control over their fate, thereby rendering death thoughts less threatening. Study 1 found that participants primed with both saving and spending reported lower death fear than controls. Saving primes, however, were associated with significantly lower death fear than spending primes. Study 2 demonstrated that mortality primes increase the attractiveness of more frugal behaviors in save-or-spend dilemmas. Studies 3 and 4 found, in two different cultures (Polish and American), that the activation of death thoughts prompts people to allocate money to saving as opposed to spending. Overall, these studies provided evidence that saving protects from existential anxiety, and probably more so than spending.

1319,Death concerns and psychological well-being in mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder,"Purpose: Utilizing a terror management theory perspective, the present research examined whether having a child with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is associated with underlying cognitions and explicit worries about death, and their roles in psychological well-being. Method: 147 mothers of children with {ASD} (n = 74) and typically developing children (n = 73) completed a fear of death scale, as well as measures of death-thought accessibility, positive and negative affect, depression, and anxiety. Results: Following previous research, mothers of children with {ASD} reported worse psychological health. Additionally, they evidenced greater death-thought accessibility compared to mothers of typically developing children, but did not differ in explicit worries about mortality. Greater death-thought accessibility, in turn, mediated the influence of {ASD} diagnosis on negative affect, depression, and anxiety. Conclusion: The current study offers an initial understanding of the association between mortality concerns and psychological health for mothers of children with {ASD}. Further, it underscores the importance of health care providers’ efforts to attend to, and educate parents about, their thoughts of mortality, even if the parent does not acknowledge such concerns. What this paper adds: The present study examined the impact of both implicit and explicit worries about death in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ({ASD}). Specifically, we were able to demonstrate that increased death-thought accessibility among mothers of children with {ASD} was associated with worse psychological health. While it is possible for parents of children with {ASD} to report conscious worries about death, there were no observed differences on this measure. As far as we know, this work is the first to empirically examine the prevalence of mortality-related concerns in this population and the subsequent effects of death-thought accessibility on psychological health. This is an important avenue of research as parents of children with {ASD} may experience greater worries about leaving their children upon death with no one to care for them, or to leave their children in the care of individuals who may not understand their son or daughter's unique needs. Additionally, the current findings highlight the importance of addressing mortality-related concerns, even when they may not be explicitly recognized, among parents of children with {ASD}. Given the effectiveness of parent education programs for children with {ASD}, a primary avenue for intervention may be education. Training care providers in ways to better discuss thoughts of death may help to alleviate stress and foster greater psychological well-being.

1320,Do internals speed less and externals speed more to cope with the death anxiety?,"Past research has showed that mortality salience ({MS}) increases reckless driving and speeding when the individual perceives driving to be relevant to his or her self-esteem. We claimed that drivers’ control orientations also play a significant role in the relationship between {MS} and speeding. We hypothesized that both a general desirability of control and traffic locus of control (T-{LOC}) would moderate the effect of {MS} on speeding. We tested our hypothesis using an online experiment on a sample of 208 young male drivers. Participants were exposed to either mortality or dental pain salience, and they filled out desirability of control, T-{LOC}, and self-report speeding measures. The results showed that, for individuals with low desirability of control, {MS} increased preferred speed and decreased intention to comply with speed limit and the percentage of time complied with the speed limit on urban roads with 50 km/h speed limit. For individuals with high desirability of control, on the other hand, {MS} increased intention to comply with the speed limit on rural roads and percentage of the time complied with the speed limit on both urban and rural roads. In contrast, the interaction between {MS} and T-{LOC} showed that an external T-{LOC} is positively associated with both intention to comply and the percentage of the time complied with the speed limits only on rural roads with 90 km/h.

1321,Cultural estrangement and terror management theory,"Describes a new measure of cultural estrangement, the Cultural Estrangement Inventory ({CEI}). The scale assesses the extent to which individuals believe (1) that their ideas, beliefs, or values differ from those of most Americans (the Atypicality subscale) and (2) that they do not fit in with mainstream American culture (the Misfit subscale). Two studies with undergraduates (aged 18–26 yrs) tested the {CEI}. Those scoring high on the Atypicality subscale reported that they perceived themselves to be nonconformists, yet these individuals did not show evidence of poor psychological adjustment. In contrast, those scoring high on the Misfit subscale reported being alienated, depressed, anxious, and low in self-esteem and life satisfaction. Self-discrepancies (a perceived gap between one's real and ideal self) were found to partially mediate the relationships between feeling like a misfit and these negative psychological outcomes. Results are discussed primarily within the context of terror management theory. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Cozzarelli, Catherine and Karafa, Joseph A.",0,,1320
1322,"Terror management theory and research: How the desire for death transcendence drives our strivings for meaning and significance - Advances in motivation science, Vol. 1.","Science tells us that humans are merely animals that evolved to survive long enough to reproduce and care for offspring before dying. Yet, people want to view life as something more and accomplish something more: to have lives that are meaningful and significant. According to terror management theory, these desires spring from the human awareness of our own vulnerability and mortality. This awareness creates a unique ever present potential for experiencing terror. To manage this potential, cultural worldviews have been constructed to imbue life with meaning and with possibilities for individuals to attain enduring significance (self-esteem). Humans function relatively securely as long as they sustain faith in such a worldview and their value within it because it provides them with the sense that they are not just transient animals fated only to obliteration; rather they will in some way transcend their own death. The theory has been supported by over 500 studies, clarifying how we humans manage this potential terror. We briefly summarize the roots and core of the theory and evidence, and branches of research pertinent to politics, religion, love, family, health, and neuroscience. We conclude by considering how death relates to other threats, and positive forms of terror management.

1323,Situational and dispositional factors moderating three types of framing effects: Mortality salience and regulatory focus,"The present study examined how situational (mortality salience) and dispositional (chronic regulatory focus) factors interact to moderate the effect of framing on decision-making. We classified 236 participants according to chronic regulatory focus and randomly assigned them to a different framing valence (i.e.. positive and negative) and a different uncertainty level (i.e.. mortality salience vs. control). Participants finished all three framing task types: attribute, goal, and risky-choice frames. Results showed significant three-way interactions in which uncertainty and regulatory focus interact to predict the occurrence of framing effects. The findings indicated that the framing effects varied according to uncertainty evoked by mortality salience and dispositional regulatory focus. The present research highlights the necessity to consider the situational and dispositional factors in order to understand the process in which the effects of framing become apparent.

1324,Meaning in terror management theory - Meaning in positive and existential psychology.,"This chapter includes a discussion of the concept of meaning and meaning-finding processes in terror management theory ({TMT}). Although {TMT} theorists recognize the importance of growth processes, meaning striving is treated in {TMT} as a defensive mechanism, intimately connected to the social-cultural context that is designed to offer protection against the existential fear of death by strengthening an individual's sense of self-worth. Beliefs in symbolic immortality, and even literal immortality, are also treated from the same defensive posture. In contrast, we argue that a growth perspective should consider the ways meaning construction may profoundly affect the way life and death are viewed. By doing so, the need for existential defenses may be drastically modified and possibly reduced. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Tomer, Adrian",0,,1323
1325,"Gender, intimacy, and risky sex: A terror management account","Three studies tested whether mortality salience would lead men to be more sexually risky than women. In Study 1, men reported greater intentions to engage in risky sexual behaviors than did women after a mortality prime, but not after a control prime. In Study 2, men desired more future sexual partners and had a lower need for intimacy than did women, but again, only when mortality was salient. Furthermore, need for romantic intimacy mediated the relationship between mortality salience, gender, and desired number of future partners. Using a behavioral rather than a self-reported dependent measure, Study 3 showed that men primed with mortality were less likely than women to select a package of condoms (versus a pen) as a free gift after the experiment. Implications for gender differences in responses to mortality salience, as well as for how to design effective safe-sex interventions, are discussed.

1326,Embodied terror management: Interpersonal touch alleviates existential concerns among individuals with low self-esteem,"Individuals with low (rather than high) self-esteem often struggle with existential concerns. In the present research, we examined whether these existential concerns may be alleviated by seemingly trivial experiences of both real and simulated interpersonal touch. A brief touch on the shoulder by a female experimenter led individuals with low self-esteem to experience less death anxiety (Study 1) and more social connectedness after a death reminder (Study 2). Reminding individuals with low self-esteem of death increased their desire for touch, as indicated by higher value estimates of a teddy bear, a toy animal that simulates interpersonal touch (Study 3). Finally, holding a teddy bear (vs. a cardboard box) led individuals with low self-esteem to respond to a death reminder with less defensive ethnocentrism (Study 4). Individuals with high self-esteem were unaffected by touch (Studies 1–4). These findings highlight the existential significance of embodied touch experiences, particularly for individuals with low self-esteem.

1327,Embracing humanity in the face of death: Why do existential concerns moderate ingroup humanization?,"People humanize their ingroup to address existential concerns about their mortality, but the reasons why they do so remain ambiguous. One explanation is that people humanize their ingroup to bolster their social identity in the face of their mortality. Alternatively, people might be motivated to see their ingroup as more uniquely human ({UH}) to distance themselves from their corporeal 'animal' nature. These explanations were tested in Australia, where social identity is tied less to {UH} and more to human nature ({HN}) which does not distinguish humans from animals. Australians attributed more {HN} traits to the ingroup when mortality was salient, while the attribution of {UH} traits remained unchanged. This indicates that the mortality-buffering function of ingroup humanization lies in reinforcing the humanness of our social identity, rather than just distancing ourselves from our animal nature. Implications for (de)humanization in intergroup relations are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Vaes, Jeroen and Bain, Paul G. and Bastian, Brock",1,,1326

In the first (N = 225), associations between attachment prototype ratings and standardized measures of self and others in relationships were examined. In a second study (N = 246), measures of anxiety and avoidance were added to the analyses. Findings from correlational and hierarchical regression analyses provided support for the notion, contrary to assumptions of the model, that qualitatively different self and other dimensions underlie different attachment styles. Results are discussed in terms of the lack of equivalency in measures of 'self' and 'other' proposed to underly each of the four attachment style ratings, the need to view attachment styles as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, and the need to continue exploration of the dimensions informing attachment.

In line with the theory of socioemotional selectivity, patients were more likely than control participants to prefer contact with familiar social partners, but this difference was stronger in younger and middle-aged patients than in older patients. Across a 6-month interval, patients' contact preferences changed according to the perceived success of therapy. For example, if therapy was perceived to be successful, patients showed an increasing interest in contacts with unfamiliar social partners. Results indicate that contact preferences are adapted to the perception of limited versus extended future lifetime.

1330,"An existentialist view on mortality salience effects: Personal hardiness, death-thought accessibility, and cultural worldview defence","Two studies examined the possible moderating role of hardiness on reactions to mortality salience inductions. A sample of 240 Israeli undergraduate students completed a hardiness scale, were exposed to a mortality salience or control induction, and then either rated the severity and punishment of 10 social transgressions (Study 1, N = 120) or performed a word-stem completion task, which tapped the accessibility of death-related thoughts (Study 2, N = 120). Results indicated that a mortality salience induction led to more severe judgments of social transgressions as well as to more severe punishments than a control induction only among participants scoring low in the hardiness scale. However, a mortality salience induction led to a higher cognitive accessibility of death-related thoughts than a control condition regardless of participants' hardiness scores. The discussion emphasizes the importance of considering inner resources when examining reactions to mortality reminders.

Meaning can be thought of as the belief that one is living a life of purpose and significance. Additionally, meaning has been defined as the feeling that the world is a predictable and reliable place, and that we can come to understand it with some sense of certainty. In the present chapter, we describe research identifying nostalgia as a meaning making resource. Specifically, we review studies demonstrating that (1) nostalgia contributes to perceptions of meaning, (2) threatened meaning increases nostalgia, (3) nostalgia mitigates the effects of various meaning-relevant threats (mortality salience, expectancy violations, boredom), and (4) nostalgia improves psychological well-being and reduces distress for people with meaning deficits. We conclude by discussing the potential for the future development of nostalgia-based clinical interventions.

1333,"Time and Terror: Managing Temporal Consciousness and the Awareness of Mortality - Understanding behavior in the context of time: Theory, research, and application.","In this chapter we use terror management theory ({TMT}; e.g., Solomon, Greenberg, \& Pyszczynski, 1991), a social psychological theory that builds from the work of Ernest Becker (1971, 1973) and other existential traditions, to explicate how the awareness of time is related to concerns about mortality. We then review a program of research that suggests people manage concerns about death by defending a socially constructed world of meaning and value in which the physical reality of mortality can be transcended either symbolically or literally via adherence to culturally delineated beliefs and values. We specifically consider the form and function of these different defenses, the temporal progression through which they manifest themselves, and the implications they have for people's ability to peacefully coexist with those who are different. Furthermore, we present new programs of research that more specifically focus on the ways in which people manage the awareness of time. Consistent with other findings derived from {TMT}, these new lines of research suggest that people defend themselves from an awareness of time and its logical connection to death by investing in beliefs that make time itself meaningful, turning to the past or future to garner a sense of personal value, and distancing from those people who are often most associated with death, the elderly.

Neuroticism's interaction with mortality salience in determining creative interest,"Some research on creativity has linked higher levels of neuroticism with greater creative achievement, whereas existential psychology sees the neurotic as incapable of channeling anxiety through creativity. The current research examines how levels of neuroticism affect individuals’ creative responses in coping with existential threats. Drawing from terror management theory and creativity research, this research conceptualizes creative endeavors as a means to ameliorate existential anxiety that possesses varying degrees of appeal to different individuals. All three experiments found an interaction between levels of neuroticism and mortality salience in determining levels of creative interest, with neuroticism either measured or primed. Specifically, mortality salience is less likely to boost creative interest among more neurotic individuals.

1335,An examination of Terror Management Theory with older adults,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) holds that individuals who are made aware of death rapidly suppress/repress it from consciousness, but this suppression leads to harsher judgments of others who violate society's norms. Although {TMT} has been supported by a large number of empirical studies showing that mortality salience ({MS}) has increased younger adults' defense of their cultural worldviews, none of this research has explicitly investigated these processes in older adults. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the mortality salience hypothesis of {TMT} can be confirmed in a population of older adults. An experiment using a 2X2X2 factorial design and {TMT} procedures was carried out, with treatment (mortality salience, control), age (young-old, old-old) and gender (male, female) as between-subjects factors and judgment scores as the dependent variable. Specifically, it was hypothesized that older individuals who are made aware of death through a {MS} treatment will show greater defense of their cultural values compared to older individuals who experience a control condition. In addition, it was hypothesized that the effect of the {MS} treatment will depend on the individual's gender and age group. Participants' defense of their worldviews after experiencing {MS} or a control condition was assessed by their judgments of a set of moral transgressions, as well as their judgments of pro- and anti-{US} essays. One hundred fifty elders (74 men, 76 women) from a Midwest community, ranging in age from 65 to 96 ( M = 76.6) were interviewed individually. Results showed no significant difference in judgments between treatment and control, either as a main effect or in interaction with age and gender, although women's judgments were significantly harsher than men's (p {\textless} .05). In an attempt to explain the findings, it was hypothesized that older adults may be less inhibited about dealing with death fear at the conscious level, using such mechanisms as conscious death acceptance or conscious avoidance, along with suppression. A follow-up study tested this with 52 participants for whom {DAP}-Rev scores on Fear and Avoidance were available. In a path analysis, {SES} (a key {TMT} variable) was both indirectly related to avoidance through fear and directly related to avoidance, with the latter directly related to judgments. This supporting evidence suggests that {TMT} may need some modification to apply to older adults, taking more account of conscious avoidance of death as well as suppression as determinants of judgments of others.

Design This is a qualitative interview study using interpretative phenomenological analysis ({IPA}). Methods: Semi‐structured interviews were carried out with a purposive sample of seven patients presenting to a mental health service in London, {UK} with symptoms of first‐episode major depression. There were four males and three females; mean age was 44 years. Interviews were audio‐recorded and subjected to {IPA}. Results: Participants described a significant loss event prior to onset of depression. The depression involved a major diminishing of the life‐world with relational, corporeal, and temporal depletion. This depletion was accompanied in each case by occasional extreme emotions, frenzied thoughts, confused sense of self. Conclusions: Depression can represent a major existential threat to the sufferer. We discuss how our findings can illuminate the extant literature. The study suggests the value of exploring these existential features in early therapy. Practitioner points Offers a detailed phenomenological analysis of core experiential features of first episode depression: being alone, being empty, life is over.

The State of Israel has been in existence for fifty-eight years, a brief period on the scale of historical processes. For more than half of this period, Israel was under realistic threat of annihilation, and it has been under siege in many ways to this very day. It is a state that has no permanent and recognized boundaries; many of its neighbors, some explicitly, still wait for it to disappear from the map. Nevertheless, Israel has been a functioning democracy throughout this period. While Ariel Sharon was prime minister, he was investigated for violations of election laws, and his son Omri was indicted for the same crime. This is not to say that Israel's history is flawless: I have opposed and condemned the policies of many in its government for many years. Nevertheless, the maintenance of a democratic regime under circumstances such as Israel's brief but intense history is, I believe, a remarkable phenomenon. The question is How does the existence of a permanent threat influence political processes? How has it shaped the Israeli political map and Israel's decision-making processes? This chapter tries to give a basic taxonomy of basic political attitudes in Israel. I hope that it will shed light on Israel's political map for those not well acquainted with Israel's internal structure. The space of this chapter will not allow going into the true complexity of a society that is yet to find its identity and the implication of this complexity for political process (Strenger 2004), but I still hope the taxonomy will be useful. This taxonomy will be guided by a central thesis: Israeli politics has been guided by a set of belief systems. As in all belief systems, the various ideologies in use do not only have the function of organizing reality for the citizens of a country. They are also defenses against unbearable anxieties. I will use terror management theory, one of the most interesting research paradigms in evolutionary and social psychology of the last two decades, as a frame of reference to organize and explain some of the political processes that Israel has undergone in its brief and dramatic history. In order to explain a crucial aspect of Israeli political thinking since 1967, I would like to present a theoretical position that will be analytically helpful. Let me begin by defining an aspect of prejudice that is important for this discussion. Prejudice, we will say, is the maintenance of beliefs about an individual or a group without taking into account available evidence.

1338,Terror management and acculturation: Do thoughts of death affect the acculturation attitudes of receiving society members?,"According to terror management theory, cognitive processes related to the awareness of one's own mortality can often exacerbate negative reactions to the presence, or to the mere existence, of individuals who hold divergent worldviews. The goal of this study was to explore whether symbolic terror management processes can have an effect on receiving society members’ acculturation attitudes toward distinct immigrant groups. In this study, following a manipulation of mortality salience ({MS}), a measure was taken of Anglo-Canadian receiving society members’ acculturation attitudes toward either culturally close (British) or culturally distant (Arab-Muslim) immigrants. The effects of {MS} on attitudes of Anglo-Canadians were measured using the Relative Acculturation Extended Model ({RAEM}). {MS} was hypothesized to lead to higher separation and lower assimilation toward British immigrants and higher assimilation and lower separation toward Arab-Muslim immigrants. The hypotheses were partially supported. {MS} led to a greater desire for separation and lesser desire for assimilation of British immigrants. {MS} led to a greater desire for assimilation of Arab-Muslim immigrants within the family relations domain of acculturation. The effects of terror management processes on acculturation attitudes are discussed primarily within the context of Canadian society, with implications for other societal settings.

1339,Coping with life's one certainty: A terror management perspective on the existentially uncertain self - Handbook of the uncertain self.,"Our species' highly evolved sense of self is immensely useful in coping with an uncertain world, but it also gives rise to the potentially terrifying awareness of the inevitability of death. According to terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Solomon, \& Arndt, 2008), and its intellectual forbearer Ernest Becker (1971,1973), people manage existential anxieties stemming from the awareness of mortality by investing in a meaningful cultural worldview that offers literal or symbolic continuance beyond death to those who meet prescribed standards of value. However, because the meaning- and value-conferring aspects of death-denying worldviews are fragile social constructions, and confidence in their absolute validity is continually susceptible to threats, people are rendered existentially uncertain: unsure whether their lives have ultimate meaning and significance or whether they are instead fated only to absolute annihilation upon death. We begin this chapter by summarizing {TMT} and the far-reaching consequences of people's struggle to secure certain knowledge of the ultimate meaning and significance of their lives. We will then review research supporting these insights and contrast {TMT} with uncertainty management theory. Finally, we consider implications of {TMT} for understanding how to manage existential uncertainty with fewer negative repercussions for individual and collective well-being.

In 5 experiments, participants were repeatedly presented with trials in which the word I was paired with positive trait terms. Relative to control conditions, this procedure enhanced implicit self-esteem. The effects generalized across 3 measures of implicit self-esteem (Experiments 1-3). Furthermore, evaluative conditioning enhanced implicit self-esteem among people with low-temporal implicit self-esteem and among people with high-temporal implicit self-esteem (Experiment 4).

1343,Adaptive memory: The survival-processing memory advantage is not due to negativity or mortality salience,"Recent research has highlighted the adaptive function of memory by showing that imagining being stranded in the grasslands without any survival material and rating words according to their survival value in this situation leads to exceptionally good memory for these words. Studies examining the role of emotions in causing the survival-processing memory advantage have been inconclusive, but some studies have suggested that the effect might be due to negativity or mortality salience. In Experiments 1 and 2, we compared the survival scenario to a control scenario that implied imagining a hopeless situation (floating in outer space with dwindling oxygen supplies) in which only suicide can avoid the agony of choking to death. Although this scenario was perceived as being more negative than the survival scenario, the survival-processing memory advantage persisted. In Experiment 3, thinking about the relevance of words for survival led to better memory for these words than did thinking about the relevance of words for death. This survival advantage was found for concrete, but not for abstract, words. The latter finding is consistent with the assumption that the survival instructions encourage participants to think about many different potential uses of items to aid survival, which may be a particularly efficient form of elaborate encoding. Together, the results suggest that thinking about death is much less effective in promoting recall than is thinking about survival. Therefore, the survival-processing memory advantage cannot be satisfactorily explained by negativity or mortality salience.

1344,"The safety of objects: Materialism, existential insecurity, and brand connection","Over the past 2 decades, a large body of research has examined how materialism is formed and how this value influences well-being. Although these studies have substantially contributed to our understanding of materialism, they shed little light on this value’s relationship to consumer behavior. Our research seeks to address this gap by examining the influence of materialism on self- and communal-brand connections. We ground our conceptualization in terror management theory and suggest that materialistic individuals form strong connections to their brands as a response to existential insecurity. We test this premise by conducting a national survey among 314 adults as well as an experiment among 125 college students. Our results provide broad support for our thesis and suggest that the fear of death encourages materialistic individuals to form strong connections with their brands.

1345,Terror management and meaning: Evidence that the opportunity to defend the worldview in response to mortality salience increases the meaningfulness of life in the mildly depressed,"Hypothesized that mildly depressed Ss who defend their worldview in response to mortality salience ({MS}) would increase their perception that the world is meaningful. A preliminary study (among 33 male and 58 female college students) examined the Kunzendorf No Meaning Scale (R. G. Kunzendorf et al, 1995–1996, and R. G. Kunzendorf and D. Maguire, 1995) as a measure to assess perceptions of meaning. In the primary study, mildly depressed and nondepressed Ss contemplated their own mortality or a neutral topic, evaluated 2 targets in a manner that either allowed them to defend their worldview or that did not, and then completed the Kunzendorf No Meaning Scale. Mildly depressed Ss who had the opportunity to defend their worldview in response to mortality salience reported greater meaning in life than did mildly depressed Ss who did not have the opportunity to defend their worldview, or mildly depressed Ss not exposed to mortality salience. Implications for understanding and treating depression are briefly discussed.

1346,"The evolution of beliefs in God, spirit, and the paranormal I: Terror management and ritual healing theories","It has been suggested that nearly universal beliefs in God, spirit, and paranormal phenomena evolved because such beliefs alleviate death anxiety. The terror management theory of religion is reviewed. Evidence for an association between lowered death anxiety and religious/paranormal beliefs is extensive, though perhaps somewhat inconsistent, and limited to particular facets of death anxiety, particular aspects of religiosity, and restricted ranges of belief conviction. There is no evidence to support the prediction that death anxiety should be associated with lowered fecundity. Paranormal beliefs are associated with religious beliefs, and the relationship between paranormal beliefs and death anxiety is similarly inconsistent. Ritual healing theory proposes that anomalous experiences occurring in the context of altered states of consciousness during shamanic rituals were the experiential source of beliefs in God, spirit, and the paranormal. Individuals high in hypnotizability were more susceptible to the beneficial health effects of shamanic healing rituals, resulting in selection for this heritable trait, facilitating the evolution of religious and paranormal experiences and beliefs.

1347,"An existential-cognitive expansion of tedeschi and calhoun's posttraumatic growth model: The roles of perceived agency, freedom and responsibility in secular worldview change","The {PGSP}-Stanford Psy.D. Consortium, Palo Alto University, 2012 This dissertation demonstrates the need for a model of secular worldview growth processes and outcomes among secular survivors of trauma. The project includes a review of Tedeschi and Calhoun's original conceptualization of Posttraumatic Growth with particular attention to the `changes in existential themes and meaning' outcome. This review highlights the ways in which secular existential themes and meaning have been conflated with spiritual and religious themes and meaning throughout subsequent developments of Tedeschi and Calhoun's Posttraumatic Growth model. The dissertation continues with a review of several areas of the literature that offer valuable resources in expanding upon Tedeschi and Calhoun's original conceptualization of the 'changes in existential themes and meaning' outcome. The existential philosophical literature as well as the following areas of existentially-relevant psychological literature is critically discussed in consideration of this expansion: Park's Meaning-Making construct, Terror Management Theory and Anxiety Buffer Disruption Theory as well as Janoff-Bulman's shattered assumptions theory of traumatic stress. The dissertation culminates in the introduction of an existential-cognitive expansion of Tedeschi and Calhoun's model of Posttraumatic Growth. This model emphasizes perceived agency, freedom and responsibility as important aspects of Posttraumatic Growth among secular survivors. The model also introduces secular faith or paradoxical belief as existential-cognitive {PTG} processes and the construct of existential authenticity as a {PTG} outcome.

1348,The thrust of the problem: Bodily inhibitions and guilt as a function of mortality salience and neuroticism,"We argue that existential concerns underlie discomfort with the physicality of the body and that activities likely to make individuals aware of their physical body (e.g., sex, dancing) may be inhibited and cause guilt. Further, individuals high in neuroticism may be especially vulnerable to such difficulties. To test this, individuals high and low in neuroticism were primed with thoughts about their mortality or a control topic and then engaged in an exercise designed to promote body awareness before self-reporting guilt. A comparison group engaged in non-body-oriented behavior. The results revealed that high neuroticism participants inhibited their body-oriented behavior when mortality was salient and that they experienced a marginal increase in guilt after performing the behavior in conjunction with mortality salience. Discussion focuses on the relationship between neuroticism, mortality salience, inhibition surrounding the body, and guilt.

Students (n = 140) completed Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale, Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, and the Democratic Values Scale. The participants also read an editorial regarding the events of 9/11/01 and completed two mortality-salience questions to induce a sense of threat. Results showed that self-esteem was a significant contributor to the prediction of scores on the Democratic Values Scale. Furthermore, the interaction between self-esteem and right-wing authoritarianism explained significant variance in the Democratic Values Scale scores.

1350,Coping with body image changes following a disfiguring burn injury,"The influence of emotion-focused coping on distress following disfiguring injury was examined. Two types of emotion-focused coping (i.e., venting emotions vs. mental disengagement) were assessed in 78 patients with burn injury at baseline during acute hospitalization. Body image dissatisfaction ({BID}) was assessed 1 week and 2 months following discharge. Use at baseline of both venting emotions and mental disengagement, compared with use of only one or neither of these coping methods, was associated at the 2-month postdischarge follow-up with significantly higher {BID} related to nonfacial aspects of appearance and with a greater negative social impact of disfigurement.

1351,"Offensive defensiveness: Toward an integrative neuroscience of compensatory zeal after mortality salience, personal uncertainty, and other poignant self-threats","When teams are losing, wise coaches do not harp on what went wrong. Instead, they rally pride and buoy confidence for seizing success. Invoking the ideal of glorious victory encourages aggressive offense, and also indirectly sharpens defense by preventing preoccupation with mistakes. I submit that a similar dynamic can help explain why mortality salience and other threats cause defensively zealous reactions (e.g., Greenberg, Solomon,\& Pyszczynski, 1997; {McGregor} \& Marigold, 2003; {McGregor}, Nail, Marigold, \& Kang, 2005; {McGregor}, Zanna, Holmes, \& Spencer, 2001; Solomon, Greenberg \& Pyszczynski, 2004). Mounting evidence now indicates that people use zealous ideals to capture their imaginations and re-engage feelings of hope and strength in the face of anxiety provoking threats. The zeal may take the form of value convictions, communal commitment, closed-minded certainty, angry jingoism, religious fervor, or political extremism. The key is that the zealous ideal serves as a beacon to attract motivational focus away from the murky threat. A neuropsychologically grounded account is presented for how defensive zeal can so effectively relieve anxious concern with mortality salience and other threats.

1352,Materialism and food security,"The present studies examined if materialists have an elevated concern about food availability, presumably stemming from a general survival security motivation. Study 1 found that materialists set a greater life goal of food security, and reported more food insecurity during their childhood. Materialists reported less present-day food insecurity. Study 2 revealed that materialists stored/hoarded more food at home, and that obese persons endorsed materialism more than low/normal weight persons. Study 3 found that experimentally decreasing participants' feelings of survival security (via a mortality salience manipulation) led to greater endorsement of materialism, food security as goal, and using food for emotional comfort. The results imply that materialists overcame the food insecurity of their childhood by making food security a top life goal, but that materialists' current concerns about food security may not wholly stem from genuine threats to their food supply.

In Studies 3 and 4, mortality salience increased supernatural agent beliefs even when supernatural agency was presented in a culturally alien context (divine Buddha in Study 3, Shamanic spirits in Study 4). The latter effects occurred primarily among the religiously affiliated, who were predominantly Christian.

1354,Consuming our immortality: A terror management perspective on how mortality salience affects consumption preferences,"The mantra of capitalism, 'He who dies with the most toys wins,' is often attributed to the value system of the American way of life. While not all consumers are driven equally by dollar signs and possessions, the virtues of materialism have been intensely infused into the fibers of American culture (Shi, 1985; Arndt et al., 2004). As Becker discusses in his (1973) work, it is only natural for one to desire the ability to show worth and meaning to the surrounding world, and the acquisition of material possessions is at least one method in which to demonstrate individual success and importance. The following research expands upon this notion by examining the emphasis consumers place on material objects within their personal worldviews, and it demonstrates that preference to such objects can be manipulated through reminders of one's own mortality. By following the principles of Terror Management Theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986), this research shows that when mortality is made salient, consumers will tap into their underlying values and desires for image enhancing items, and preference for items that can exhibit importance or success are significantly higher than when thoughts of death have not been accessed.

1355,Mortality salience: Testing the predictions of Terror Management Theory,"One prediction made by Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) is that when mortality is made salient the need for cultural worldview defenses should increase. The current project was an attempt to test this prediction through four separate studies. Participants in each study were asked to reflect upon one of two thoughts: their mortality or dental pain. Following this manipulation, each study measured a specific self-reported outcome. In the first study, 158 participants filled out a state body-image assessment, revealing no difference between conditions. In the second study, 106 participants filled out a questionnaire on meaning in life and culturally-relevant beliefs, revealing no differences between groups. The third study examined 144 participants to determine if mortality salience could exaggerate the halo effect and cause participants to judge attractive people even more favorably; the results did not support such a relationship. The fourth study tested 205 participants to see if mortality reminders would alter how participants perceived an ambiguous video; again, a causal relationship was not evidenced.

1356,Play It Safe or Go for the Gold? A Terror Management Perspective on Self-Enhancement and Self-Protective Motives in Risky Decision Making,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) posits that bolstering self-esteem buffers mortality concerns; accordingly, in past research, heightening mortality salience ({MS}) increases self-enhancement. However, risky self-esteem-relevant decisions often present a choice between enhancing self-esteem by striving for excellence and protecting self-esteem by avoiding potential failure. Which strategy is preferred under {MS}? Combining {TMT} with insights from Steele, Spencer, and Lynch's (1993) resource model, the authors hypothesized and found that {MS} leads high, but not low, self-esteem participants faced with a risky decision to pursue opportunities for excellence despite substantial risk of failure (Studies 1 and 2); in Study 3, using a more impactful decision, this effect was replicated and it was furthermore found that mortality-salient low-self-esteem participants become more risk-averse. Furthermore, in Study 2, a self-affirmation prime, previously shown to reduce {MS}-induced defenses, eliminated the self-enhancement effect among high-self-esteem participants. Implications for understanding self-esteem, {TMT}, and risky decision making are briefly discussed.

Studies 2 (N = 60) and 3 (N = 139) demonstrated that young male drivers who perceived driving (fast) to be beneficial for self-esteem reported higher intentions to take driving risks (Study 2) and drive fast (Study 3) after exposure to such information compared to controls. Study 3 further demonstrated that the inclusion of a prime to behave responsibly eliminated this effect. Study 4 (N = 92) revealed that exposure to this prime alongside the mortality-related information generated increased accessibility of responsibility-related constructs and reduced accessibility of mortality-related constructs among young male drivers.

Toward this end, an induced-compliance experiment was conducted in which participants were given high versus low choice to write a counterattitudinal statement regarding a boring topic under conditions of either mortality salience ({MS}) or uncertainty salience (control). It was predicted that although dissonance reduction (via attitude change) would be provoked in the control group, {MS} would significantly exacerbate this effect. These predictions were borne out empirically. The findings, obtained using the historically preeminent paradigm for assessing dissonance reduction, provide firm support for the notion that {MS} amplifies concerns with cognitive consistency.

In considering these issues, I adopt the perspective of terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1997) to explain the existential underpinnings of the action tendencies people experience and exhibit toward others in need, because recent terror management research has provided insight into the processes that promote or impede prosocial behavior. Here, I focus mainly on the contrast between organ donation and charitable contributions, and on helping people with physical disabilities compared with helping nondisabled people. These examples help to illuminate the reasons underlying the ambivalence people often experience following requests for prosocial behavior when personal death is salient.

In a qualitative follow-up study, when reminded about mortality, the participants reported less individual sadness than expected; whereas when the participants were reminded about paralysis, greater individual sadness was reported.

This perspective suggests that individuals, particularly those high in neuroticism, are threatened by that which reminds them of their physical and mortal nature. In Study 1, a laboratory experiment demonstrated that when concerns about mortality were primed, reminders of one’s physical nature (i.e. creatureliness) led women who were high in neuroticism to report reduced willingness to imagine undergoing a mammogram. In Study 2, a field experiment among women receiving a mammogram showed that priming creatureliness increased perceptions of discomfort with the procedure for women high in neuroticism.

1365,"Not the future we ordered: Peak oil, psychology, and the myth of progress","For well over half a century, since the first credible warnings of petroleum depletion were raised in the 1950s, contemporary industrial civilization has been caught in a remarkable paradox: a culture more focused on problem solving than any other has repeatedly failed to deal with, or even consider, the problem most likely to bring its own history to a full stop. The coming of peak oil—the peaking and irreversible decline of world petroleum production—poses an existential threat to societies in which every sector of the economy depends on petroleum-based transport, and no known energy source can scale up extensively or quickly enough to replace dwindling oil supplies. Resolute action on personal, local, national, and global levels over the decades just passed might have staved off a future of economic contraction, political turmoil, and immense human suffering. Instead, governments and populations of all the world’s industrial nations collectively closed their eyes to the impending crisis. Not The Future We Ordered is the first study of the psychological dimensions of that decision and its consequences, as a case study in the social psychology of collective failure, and as an issue with which psychologists and therapists will be confronted repeatedly in the years ahead. At the core of the modern world’s inability to come to grips with the challenge of peak oil are a set of beliefs that amount to a civil religion of progress, in which the concept of progress is credited with the invincibility and beneficence other religions assign to their gods. This civil religion of progress lends legitimacy to policies that subordinate all other values to economic growth, place blind faith in untested technologies, and rule out serious consideration of the long-term downsides of today’s trends. The religious faith in progress that makes such policies seem sensible, and provides justification for the marginalization of alternative views, has become one of the core factors driving contemporary societies headlong toward a wrenching confrontation with the hard limits of a finite planet. As the gap widens between today’s expectations of perpetual progress and tomorrow’s experiences, peak oil will become a significant mental health issue across the currently industrialized world. When 'the future we ordered' fails to show up on schedule, cognitive dissonance and other psychological impacts common in times of severe cultural dislocation will likely show up as well, driving counterproductive responses on the personal and collective scales. Understanding the psychology that backed industrial civilization into a corner called 'peak oil' is a crucial step in dealing with these consequences, and to this, Not The Future We Ordered offers a clear and readable guide.

1366,The self under siege: A therapeutic model for differentiation,"How much of our identity or 'self' is truly representative of our own wants, needs, and goals in life and how much does it reflect the desires and priorities of someone else? Are we following our own destiny or are we unconsciously repeating the lives of our parents, living according to their values, ideals, and beliefs? In this thought-provoking book, noted clinical psychologist Robert Firestone and his co-authors explore the struggle that all of us face in striving to retain a sense of ourselves as unique individuals. Through numerous case studies and personal stories from men and women who participated in a 35-year observational study, the authors illustrate how voice therapy, a methodology pioneered by Firestone, is used to illicit, identify, and challenge the destructive inner voice and to change aversive behaviors. The theory they describe integrates the psychodynamic and existential approaches and is enriched by research findings in the neurosciences, attachment research, and terror management theory ({TMT}). An important addition to the area of personality development theory, this book offers a new perspective on differentiation and the battle to separate ourselves from the chains of the past. It will provide psychotherapists and other mental health professionals with the tools needed to help clients differentiate from the dysfunctional attitudes and toxic personality traits of their parents, other family members, and harmful societal influences that have unconsciously dominated their lives.

1367,The terror of pregnancy: The origin of ambivalent attitudes,"Research on Terror Management Theory ({TMT}; Goldenberg, Goplen, Cox, \& Arndt, 2007) has offered an explanation for the negative views toward uniquely feminine physical features, as well as the ambivalence and prejudice displayed toward pregnant women. Participants read an essay on either creatureliness, uniqueness, or no essay, and then they completed inventories assessing negative attitudes toward corporal attributes. Attitudes toward semen and menstrual blood were found to be undifferentiated, p = .95. Next, in a modification of Goldenberg et al., participants rated the offensiveness of a photograph of a pregnant or nonpregnant model, as well as her competence level and whether the image evoked anger. Prior findings of increased offensiveness and lower competence evaluations of a pregnant female model, as a product of priming the similarities of humans and animals, were not replicated. Participants who did not read an essay displayed increased anger toward the pregnant model (p = .04, ηp² = .07), indicating that Ambivalent Sexism Theory may provide a strong conceptual framework for the explanation of ambivalent attitudes toward pregnant women.

1368,"I won't live on, so i create: Mortality salience and afterlife belief strength's impact on intention to engage in creation-oriented consumption","Creative behaviors are part of an average consumer's everyday life. For example, amateur people buy various art and craft supplies from stores like Michael's, purchase studio time to make pottery, and collect camera accessories to help demonstrate their originality in photography. Usually the final creative product can be preserved for a long period of time. These creative activities are avidly pursued primarily because they provide consumers with enjoyment and a sense of fulfillment. I am coining the term 'creation-oriented consumption' to refer to this phenomenon, which is one specific type of creative consumption. Terror management theory is used to examine why people engage in creation-oriented consumption. I hypothesize that mortality salience boosts the intention to engage in creation-oriented consumption; and under mortality salience, weakened afterlife belief increases the intention for this type of consumption. Three experimental studies are conducted, each adopting a somewhat different perspective. Study 1 gauges intention to engage in creation-oriented consumption against inaction. It finds that mortality salience increases interest in creation-oriented consumption; and that under mortality salience, weakened afterlife belief increases interest in creation-oriented consumption. Study 2 examines durable creation-oriented consumption's appeal relative to other activities, namely, non-creative activities and creative consumption that does not leave durable traces. The proposed effect of mortality salience is observed only when individuals possess a low level of chronic afterlife belief. Unexpectedly, interest in creative consumption is reduced under mortality salience. Consistent with study 1, study 2 finds that under mortality salience, weakened afterlife belief raises interest in creation-oriented consumption. Study 3 replicates the finding of study 2 that mortality salience dampens general interest in creativity. Taken together, these studies suggest that although creation-oriented consumption ameliorates existential anxiety, it is not the most effective one in the short term. Apart from the major hypotheses, this dissertation also investigates some boundary conditions. Two of the three studies find that the question of whether creative consumption leaves a durable trace is of significance.

1369,Mortality salience and religion: Divergent effects on the defense of cultural worldviews for the religious and the non-religious,"Religious and non-religious individuals differ in their core beliefs. The religious endorse a supernatural, divinely inspired view of the world, while the non-religious hold largely secular worldviews. As a result they may respond differently to existential threats. Three studies confirmed this prediction. After a mortality salience ({MS}) or control prime, Canadian participants read, and responded to, an essay hostile to Western civilization, allegedly written by a radical Muslim student. Results indicated that the non-religious reliably showed the conventional cultural worldview defense by devaluating the content of the message and decreasing support for the civil rights of anti-Western individuals when death was salient. No such effect was found for the religious. Religious and non-religious participants did not differ in self-esteem levels or in death-thought accessibility. These results suggest that a religious stance among believers plays a defensive role against the awareness of death.

1372,Death and television: Terror management theory and themes of law and justice on television,"Based on terror management theory, it was hypothesized that media choices may be affected by the salience of death-related thoughts. Three experiments with samples of undergraduate students were conducted to investigate whether such a process would affect preferences for law and justice television programming. In the first experiment (n = 132), individuals for whom mortality had been made salient through experimental induction preferred more programs with law and justice themes than individuals for whom mortality had not been made salient. In the second experiment (n = 161), this effect was observed regardless of trust in law enforcement and only for participants induced to think about death, not those induced to think about pain. In the third experiment (n = 163), participants for whom mortality was salient who watched a crime drama that showed justice being carried out showed a diminished self-enhancing bias compared to participants who watched a version of the same program in which justice was thwarted. Results indicate that entertainment choices are influenced by thought of death beyond simply seeking distraction and that entertainment programming emphasizing justice can effectively ameliorate existential anxiety that arises from thoughts of death.

1373,Lethal consumption: Death-denying materialism - Psychology and consumer culture:  The struggle for a good life in a materialistic world.,"The purpose of this chapter is to explain the psychological underpinnings of conspicuous consumption from the perspective of terror management theory. Our basic thesis is that conspicuous consumption is a direct result of the uniquely human awareness of mortality and the pursuit of self-worth and death transcendence that this awareness engenders. Although it is easy to critique contemporary American examples of greed and extravagance, given the long and extensive human history of gratuitous consumption, we cannot chalk it up to the influence of modern capitalism or corporate culture; rather, it is a consequence of basic universal needs. Indeed, we argue that if contemporary humans are more extravagantly wasteful, it is primarily because of modern technology rather than because of any new social or psychological developments. We present historical and empirical evidence in support of our terror management explanation of consumerism. Finally, we consider what might be done to foster 'life-sustaining consumption,' divested of the malignant, psychopathological desire for infinite amounts of superfluous stuff that undermines human happiness and threatens the very existence of the human species by polluting and depleting the natural resources upon which our survival ultimately depends.

1374,A moral‐existential account of the psychological factors fostering intergroup conflict,"We combine ideas from terror management and moral foundations theories to analyze the role of existential and moral concerns in the creation and escalation of intergroup conflict. We argue that moral values, as important components of cultural worldviews, serve to buffer existential anxiety. Perceived threats to one’s moral values thus are capable of inducing existential anxiety and unleashing strong moral emotions, creating the psychological impetus for intergroup conflict and violence. We review evidence that threats to the five core moral intuitions posited by moral foundations theory (harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity) are associated with existential anxiety and that this contributes to intergroup strife and violence. Moral and existential concerns combine to create a vicious feedback loop that leads to self-perpetuating spirals of violence, which helps explain the intractability of many real-life conflicts.

1375,"Terror management theory: Interplay between mortality salience, death-thoughts, and overall worldview defense","This study examines both the generalizability of Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) and the mechanisms by which individual difference variables work in the {TMT} model. A plethora of research exists to support {TMT}, a theory that explains much of human behavior as attempts to buffer the potential for anxiety provoked by being aware of one's own inevitable mortality (Pyszczynski et al., 2003). This dissertation investigated the generalizability of Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) and the mechanisms by which individual difference variables work in the {TMT} process. In order to do so, an operationalization of the variable 'overall worldview' was provided. Participants consisted of 367 college students from the Psychology Department Experimental Subject Pool of a mid-sized Midwestern university. Subjects were quasi-randomly assigned to a 2 (mortality salience vs. control) x 2 (death-thought word stems vs. neutral word stems) between subjects design. Results suggested that humanists defended humanism more in the mortality salience condition than in the dental pain condition. However, mortality salience did not increase the defense of the normative worldview for normatives. Contrary to expectations, humanists and normatives defended their respective worldviews to an equivalent extent in the mortality salience condition. Mortality salience did not lead to defense of the American worldview for normatives or for humanists. Participants in the mortality salience condition, humanists, and normatives did not differ on the number of accessible death-thoughts in either the mortality salience or the dental pain condition. Despite methodological limitations, this study suggests that, at least for humanists, {TMT} does generalize beyond specific cultural worldviews to overall worldviews. It also indicates that the individual difference variables of being humanist/non-humanist and normative/non-normative do not affect the ability of mortality salience to prime death-thoughts. Rather, being humanist or non-humanist affects worldview defense after the death-thoughts have been primed and before distal defenses (i.e., worldview defense) are activated.

1376,Why war? Fear is the mother of violence - The psychological impact of war trauma on civilians:  An international perspective.,"The authors present the terror management theory perspective, whereby human beings purchase psychological equanimity by collectively deluding themselves about the fragility of existence and the inevitability of its termination. This analysis helps us understand humanity's appalling violence by providing insights into three propensities that contribute to war: The existence of differing beliefs, the use of others as scapegoats, and the tenacious identities of self and other and the conflict between them. Terror management theory helps to make sense of history and ongoing events by viewing reactions to others in light of the three propensities towards war. From this perspective, groups respond to those who are different in ways that serve their own psychological equanimity: Derogation, assimilation, and annihilation. Links to research and implications for the future are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Solomon, Sheldon and Greenberg, Jeff and Pyszczynski, Tom",0,,1375

In Study 7 (N=60), a higher accessibility of death-related thoughts was found following induction of thoughts about separation from the infant. In Study 2 (N=100), a mortality salience induction led to higher maternal separation anxiety. Contrary to expectations, these findings were not moderated by mother's attachment style. The results are explained in terms of Terror Management Theory, and demonstrate its applicability to maternal emotions and cognitions.

1379,Effects of mortality salience on self-effacing attribution and anticipation for supportive attribution by close friends,"Recent studies have suggested that interpersonal relationships have a buffering effect on existential terror, hence people strive to strengthen relationships in response to mortality salience ({MS}). Wakimoto (2006) have reported that Japanese show greater self-effacement as a way to maintain harmony in relationships when mortality is salient. Considering that Japanese people are likely to anticipate a supportive reaction by others when they show self-effacement, it was predicted that {MS} intensifies expectations of their friends' supportiveness, as well as expression of self-effacement. It was also expected that these effects would be moderated by attachment style. These predictions were examined with regard to causal attribution of past success and failure. Fifty-two Japanese undergraduates responded to items probing their attribution of past success and failure, and their prediction of their close friends' attribution of the events. The results indicated that {MS} raises expectations for supportive attribution form close friends, when self-effacing attribution is induced. However, an increase in expectation for supportive attribution after {MS} did not necessarily accompany more self-effacing attribution. Suggestions for future research on terror management through close relationships were discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Wakimoto, Ryutaro",1,,1378

Buddhist reincarnation beliefs were unrelated to personal death anxiety. This suggests that not all religious afterlife beliefs have death anxiety buffering power as proposed by Terror Management Theory, perhaps because Buddhists view reincarnation not as a solace but rather as a renewal of sufferings due to unwholesome karma. Future cross-religion comparison studies could investigate the efficacy of reincarnation beliefs as a personal death anxiety defense mechanism in a Hindu sample.

1381,"Breaking apart the typical mortality salience manipulation: Two questions, two outcomes","The typical mortality salience manipulation asks participants to reflect on two questions, one about the emotions associated with the thought of death and the other about what happens after one dies. In five experiments, we separated these two questions and gave participants either one or a control question. In Experiment 1, participants’ responses to the afterlife question were coded as being informed more by cultural knowledge and values compared with responses to the emotion question. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that participants responding to the afterlife question showed greater stereotype usage compared with those responding to the emotion or a control question. In Experiment 4, results illustrate that the afterlife and emotion question differ on various coding dimensions related to self-focus, emotion, and culturally related death words, but not death-related words. In addition, participants who responded to the afterlife question demonstrated greater cultural worldview defense by setting a higher bail for an alleged prostitute compared with those who answered the emotion or a control question. In Experiment 5, participants responding to the emotion question demonstrated a greater preference for personally endorsed values compared with those who responded to the emotion or a control question. These results suggest that the two questions used in the common mortality salience manipulation produce different results when separated.

1382,When death is good for life: Considering the positive trajectories of terror management,"Research derived from terror management theory ({TMT}) has shown that people’s efforts to manage the awareness of death often have deleterious consequences for the individual and society. The present article takes a closer look at the conceptual foundations of {TMT} and considers some of the more beneficial trajectories of the terror management process. The awareness of mortality can motivate people to enhance their physical health and prioritize growth-oriented goals; live up to positive standards and beliefs; build supportive relationships and encourage the development of peaceful, charitable communities; and foster open-minded and growth-oriented behaviors. The article also tentatively explores the potential enriching impact of direct encounters with death. Overall, the present analysis suggests that although death awareness can, at times, generate negative outcomes, it can also function to move people along more positive trajectories and contribute to the good life.

1383,"Priming, shifting selves and decision making:  The role of personal meaning systems in consumer choice","Much research has established that an individual's preferences are contingent on elements of the decision environment, such as the response mode or framing of choices (Payne, Bettman \& Johnson, 1992). In addition, it is well established that activating a product category (Herr, 1989) or product feature (Yi, 1990) in a consumer's memory can influence subsequent judgments. However, this dissertation takes a subtler route, by priming higher level concepts that are seemingly unrelated to consumption preferences. Three separate essays establish that the activation of these subtler concepts, such as an individual's self-conception or feelings about mortality, can also influence purchase decisions. The first essay, entitled, 'Constructing Preferences Online,' shows that a variable as subtle as the background design of a web page can also change preferences. An individual examining a web page can be primed by the background pictures or colors, which then affect attribute weights and ultimately product choice. A series of experiments found that these background stimuli influenced both the order of external information search and the participants' choice of products. The second essay, entitled, 'Terror Management and Marketing,' demonstrates that exposure to death-related material activates one's desire to be an exemplary member of society, thereby increasing interest in high-status products. Individuals who were subtly reminded of their own impending mortality evaluated high-status items more favorably than did control subjects. In contrast, mortality salient subjects rated low-status and non-status products slightly less favorably than did their control counterparts. The third essay, entitled, 'Shifting Selves and Decision Making,' illustrates how priming different self-construals can impact consumers' decision making. Experiment I showed that individuals whose interdependent selves were activated were more risk-seeking in their choices of gambles, and more likely to choose products that conformed to social norms, than were those whose independent selves were activated. Follow-up experiments further examined the conditions under which self-construal priming can influence choice, and used implicit memory measures to explain the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon.

In the lung cancer conditions, target gender also was manipulated. Social distance and emotional responses differed according to participant gender, death anxiety, and target cancer type.

1385,"Terrorism, violence, and hope for peace: A terror management perspective","Terror management theory ({TMT}) is used to explore psychological forces that act to promote or discourage support for terrorism and violent counterterrorist policies. According to {TMT}, domination, humiliation, and perceived injustice threaten the self-esteem and cultural worldviews that protect people from death-related anxiety; the result may be hostility and violence directed against the threatening out-group as a way of defusing this threat. We review research documenting the role of terror management processes in promoting and discouraging support for terrorism and violent counterterrorist policies and discuss the implications of this research. The studies we review suggest that the same psychological forces that promote support for terrorist violence also promote support for aggressive counterterrorist policies and that these forces can be redirected to encourage support for more peaceful solutions on both sides of the current conflict between Islamic radical groups and Western nations.

In Study 1, women emphasized relational self-aspects in response to mortality salience, compared to men. In Study 2, high self-esteem individuals showed more polarized self-knowledge after mortality salience, while in Study 3 they became faster in their self-categorizations when faced with uncertainty, and more consistent and faster in their self-categorizations when faced with isolation, relative to those with low self-esteem. In the discussion, we focus on how these outcomes can be interpreted as meaning maintenance, clarify the role of self-esteem, and offer directions for future research.

1387,A Time to Tan: Proximal and Distal Effects of Mortality Salience on Sun Exposure Intentions,"According to the dual defense model of terror management, proximal defenses are engaged to reduce the conscious impact of mortality salience, whereas thoughts of death outside of conscious awareness motivate distal defenses aimed at maintaining self-esteem. Two experiments examined these ideas by assessing women's intentions to engage in tanning-related behavior. In Study 1, when concerns about death (relative to dental pain) were in focal attention, participants increased intentions to protect themselves from dangerous sun exposure. In contrast, when thoughts about death were outside of focal attention, participants decreased interest in sun protection. In Study 2, participants primed to associate tanned skin with an attractive appearance responded to mortality concerns outside of focal attention with increased interest in tanning products and services. These findings are discussed in relation to the dual-defense model of terror management, societal determinants of self-esteem, and implications for health risk and promotion.

1388,Gender-Typical Responses to Sexual and Emotional Infidelity as a Function of Mortality Salience Induced Self-Esteem Striving,"The authors propose that gender-differentiated patterns of jealousy in response to sexual and emotional infidelity are engendered by the differential impact of each event on self-esteem for men and women. Study 1 demonstrated that men derive relatively more self-esteem from their sex lives, whereas women's self esteem is more contingent on romantic commitment. Based on terror management theory, it is predicted that if gender differentiated responses to infidelity are motivated by gender specific contingencies for self-esteem, they should be intensified following reminders of mortality. In Study 2, mortality salience ({MS}) increased distress in response to sexual infidelity for men and emotional infidelity for women. Study 3 demonstrated that following {MS}, men who place high value on sex in romantic relationships exhibited greater distress in response to sexual infidelity, but low -ex-value men's distress was attenuated. The authors discuss the implications for evolutionary and self-esteem-based accounts of jealousy as well as possible integration of these perspectives.

1389,"Threat, Authoritarianism, and Selective Exposure to Information","We examined the hypothesis that threat alters the cognitive strategies used by high authoritarians in seeking out new political information from the environment. In a laboratory experiment, threat was manipulated through a 'mortality salience' manipulation used in research on terror management theory (Pyszczynski, Solomon, \& Greenberg, 2003). Subjects (N = 92) were then invited to read one of three editorial articles on the topic of capital punishment. We found that in the absence of threat, both low and high authoritarians were responsive to salient norms of evenhandedness in information selection, preferring exposure to a two-sided article that presents the merits of both sides of an issue to an article that selectively touts the benefits of the pro or con side of the issue. However, in the presence of threat, high but not low authoritarians became significantly more interested in exposure to an article containing uniformly pro-attitudinal arguments, and significantly less interested in a balanced, two-sided article. Finally, a path analysis indicated that selective exposure to attitude-congruent information led to more internally consistent policy attitudes and inhibited attitude change. Discussion focuses on the role of threat in conditioning the cognitive and attitudinal effects of authoritarianism.

Cultural loading demonstrably influences test performance, but why? Drawing on converging perspectives on the psychological function of culture, this article proposes that one factor is the individual's internal motivation to affirm and uphold the cultural worldview. This possibility is tested within the framework of terror management theory, which claims that cultural worldview adherence defends against mortality-related concerns. It is hypothesized that making mortality salient would (a) improve performance on standardized test items when, incidental to the problem structure, the correct answers affirm prevailing cultural stereotypes and (b) impair test performance when excelling violates stereotypic expectancies for one's group. Two studies provide support for these hypotheses. Implications for test validity are briefly discussed.

The Terror Management Function of Eating,"To examine whether the soothing effect of food may be related to terror management processes, 149 Israeli college students were assigned to a mortality salience, fail salience, or neutral condition. Then, they were exposed to 1 of 3 tasting conditions ranging from pleasant to unpleasant or to a fourth condition with no tasting. Following this procedure all participants were asked to judge the severity of 10 social transgressions and recommend punishments. The results showed that in the no-tasting condition mortality salience led to more severe judgments of social transgressions than in the 2 control conditions. However, this effect was attenuated in the tasting conditions, especially in the positive taste condition wherein death primes led to less severe judgments of transgressions than in the other conditions. The discussion examines the utility of a terror management perspective in understanding the relation between stress and overeating.

1392,Ethnocultural conflict and cooperation in Hawai'i - Handbook of ethnic conflict: International perspectives.,"Salzman examines the development of ethnocultural tolerance in Hawaii as a potential model for the intentional creation of optimal intergroup contact. Various theoretical lenses are utilized to examine the progression from initial cultural conflict to relative harmony. Values inherent in Hawaiian culture are also explored as they have impacted the current cultural context. Hawaii is recognized as unique in many respects including in its ecology, geography, and ethnic diversity. While Salzman points out that some cultural conflict is still present in Hawaii, cultural relations are largely reflective of the Hawaiian value of 'Aloha Spirit' which is credited with affecting acceptance of the various cultures represented. The high rate of intermarriage in Hawaii is also discussed as it positively impacts cultural tolerance. A historical overview of the colonization of Hawaii is provided and Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) applied to explore the mechanisms through which the loss of native culture creates a state in which conflict is imminent. The labor movement is presented as a catalyst which shifted Hawaii from conflict, through creation of a superordinate identity based on common goals. Salzman presents this shift as the beginning of 'local' culture which is inclusive of individuals sharing common values and language. Salzman concludes with a discussion of various theoretical models applicable to cultural contact. Factors that create conflict are examined along with those that enhance mutual appreciation. A potential solution to conflict styles of contact is provided which includes the intentional creation of specific conditions such as those exhibited in Hawaii.

1393,Analysing the effects of mortality salience on prejudice and decision-taking - New developments in the psychology of motivation.,"Recently (Echebarria \& Fernandez, 2006) we carried out a quasi-experimental study on the effects of the terrorist attacks against the railways in Madrid that found that these attacks provoked a generalized prejudiced directed no only against groups esigned as the responsible of the attacks but also against other no related group (Jews). Furthermore, a generalized displacement toward more conservative values and political options was also found. Two follows-up experimental studies designed to analyse the socio-psychological processes that can underlie these changes are presented. The first study manipulated through pictures the salience of death-related thoughts without involving any personal or group based threat. The generalized increment of prejudices and group bias are replied but only at an implicit level. The second study proved that the mortality salience affects how social dilemmas are approached. Participants assigned to the mortality salient condition approached a health related dilemma in terms of losses independently of how it was experimental framed. In contrast, control participants shifted their elections in function to the experimental manipulation. The implications of these results in terms of understanding the effects of terrorism from the Terror Management Theory are discussed.

1394,Terror-related negativity: Exploring mortality salience-induced self-regulation and its neurobiological implementation,"Over 20 years of research on terror management theory has demonstrated that reminders of death (mortality salience; {MS}) heighten individuals’ investment in prioritized bases of value and meaning. Research in this vein has shown that {MS} intensifies people’s efforts to demonstrate personal value on tasks relevant to their self-esteem ('self-esteem striving'). Though much work illustrates that such responses function to mitigate death-related concerns, to date no work has directly assessed the particular regulatory mechanisms that implement {MS}-induced self-esteem striving. The present study aimed to do so by measuring neural indices of performance monitoring. During a tasked framed as diagnostic of self-esteem relevant attributes, participants were randomly assigned to receive subliminal primes of the word death or of control terms. Response-locked brain signals were recorded to assess reactivity to correct and incorrect responses during the task. Results showed that death-primed (vs. control) participants exhibited greater neural reactivity following error commission as indexed by larger amplitude of the Error Related Negativity ({ERN}). Death-primed (vs. control) participants also exhibited intensified behavioral efforts to improve their performance following error commission (i.e., post-error slowing, post-error accuracy), effects that were likely mediated by the activity of neural mechanisms that generate the {ERN}. Furthermore, among death-primed participants, behavioral improvements on the self-esteem relevant task correlated with attenuations in death thought accessibility. Receiving death primes did not influence neural reactivity to correct responses (Correct Related Negativity; {CRN}) nor did it heighten a neural index of explicit error awareness (Error Positivity; Pe). Together these findings suggest that {MS}-induced self-esteem striving is implemented via automatic monitoring and avoidance of errors. The role of avoidance motivation in self-esteem striving is thus discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Kosloff, Daniel (Spee)",0,,1393
1395,"The aftermath of destruction: Images of destroyed buildings increase support for war, dogmatism, and death thought accessibility","Building on terror management theory, we hypothesized that viewing destroyed buildings would increase death thought accessibility and thereby elicit dogmatic belief and hostile worldview defenses. In Study 1, images of destroyed buildings and deadly terrorist attacks elicited greater death-thought accessibility than images of construction sites or intact buildings. Images of destruction also enhanced dogmatic belief (Study 2) and support for military action against Iran (Study 3). Study 4 found that heightened death thought accessibility, but not the accessibility of thoughts of war or national identity, statistically mediated the relationship between visible destruction and worldview defense. Further, although destruction images increased dogmatism, political orientation was not affected by the destruction manipulation nor was political orientation related to death-thought accessibility. Overall, these findings suggest that visibly destroyed infrastructure can motivate increased certainty of beliefs and support for military aggression (e.g., war and/or terrorism) against groups perceived to be threatening to one's worldview.

1396,"Fearing the uncertain: A causal exploration of self-esteem, self-uncertainty, and mortality salience","Social identity theory (Tajfel \& Turner, 1979) is one of the most influential social psychological theories of group behavior and intergroup relations. Early social identity research focused on many different group processes; however, the motivation behind group identification was not fully explored. Researchers have proposed a variety of accounts for why people join and identify with groups. This dissertation unravels the relationship between, on the one hand, mortality salience, self-related uncertainty and self-esteem, and on the other group identification and ingroup defense. The general hypothesis derived from uncertainty-identity theory (Hogg, 2010) is that uncertainty and not fear of death or pursuit of self-esteem motivate people to identify with and defend their groups, and that identification mediates the relationship between uncertainty and defense of the group. Experiment 1 (N = 112) tested the relationship between uncertainty and self-esteem on defense of the ingroup, with the additional test of the mediating effects of identification with the group between uncertainty and ingroup defense. Results showed that uncertainty and not self-esteem motivate people to identify with a group, to defend their group, and that group defense is mediated by identification. Experiment 2 (N = 112) provided a replication of the typical {TMT} study, which suggests that self-esteem will buffer the effects of mortality salience on ingroup defense, with the additional test of the mediating effects of identification between mortality salience and defense of one's group. As predicted, mortality salience only increased identification and defense of the group when self-esteem was not enhanced, as well, the interactive effects of mortality salience and self-esteem on defense was mediated by identification. Experiment 3 (N = 294) was a combination of both Experiments 1 and 2 and tested the hypothesis that uncertainty would moderate the relationship between self-esteem and mortality salience on group identification and ingroup defense. Exactly as predicted, only under high uncertainty the typical {TMT} results are demonstrated. Results across these three experiments demonstrate that self-uncertainty plays a significant role in reactions to mortality salience, and support uncertainty-identity theory's analysis of the role of self-uncertainty in ideological conviction and group behavior.

1398,A terror management perspective on spirituality and the problem of the body - Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes.,"In this chapter, we introduce terror management theory ({TMT}; see Pyszczynski, Greenberg, \& Solomon, 1997, for a review), an empirically oriented framework based on Becker's ideas, as a fruitful source of hypotheses related to the fear of death, discomfort with the body, and the use of spirituality as a defense against mortality concerns. We will review recent empirical evidence demonstrating that the body can serve as an existential threat and that spirituality can provide a psychological buffer against mortality concerns. We then discuss how this dual framework is applicable to the most influential religious meaning-systems that humans have constructed in the recorded past and continue to cultivate and follow. Finally, we discuss the viability of the dual solution to mortality concerns. We highlight some destructive consequences arising from the denial of the natural body and defense of one's spiritual beliefs, and we speculate about more benign approaches to spirituality. We hope that from this analysis, a picture will emerge of the human condition as inspired toward flights of spiritual imagination in an essential reaction to our ultimate creaturely finitude. In this view, spirituality is an inevitable solution to the paradox of conscious mortal existence--inevitable because human consciousness is phenomenologically dualistic, a mind in a body; a solution because the experience of dualism can allow us to deny the fate of our physical bodies by capitalizing on our ability to think of ourselves and our universe in symbolic, meaningful terms.

1399,Intrinsic religiosity reduces intergroup hostility under mortality salience,"Results of three studies indicate that intrinsic religiosity and mortality salience interact to predict intergroup hostility. Study 1, conducted among 200 American Christians and Jews, reveals that under mortality salience, intrinsic (but not extrinsic or quest) religiosity is related to decreased support for aggressive counterterrorism. Study 2, conducted among 148 Muslims in Iran, demonstrates that intrinsic religiosity predicts decreased out-group derogation under mortality salience. Study 3, conducted among 131 Polish Christians, shows that under mortality salience, priming of intrinsic religious concepts decreases support for aggressive counterterrorism.

1400,The 'simmie' side of life: Old Order Amish youths' affective reponse to culturally prescribed deviance,"In this article, an analysis has been provided of the counterintuitive affective response Old Order Amish youth make to unique cultural prescriptions for adolescent deviance, which have been constructed by adult Amish culture. Data reported on were gathered as part of a larger ethnographic study and through more than 60 in-depth interviews on this particular topic with 16-25 yr old Amish youths. Evidence was found that supports the basic principles of Terror Management Theory, although in an unexpected and indirect fashion. Rather than function as a specialized cultural-anxiety buffer against fear generated by the contemplation of mortality, as Terror Management Theory would predict, the deviance prescribed for youth culture produces high levels of anxiety and depression for Amish youth. In this cultural context, youth find existential value in adult, not youth, culture. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Reiling, Denise M.",0,,1399
1401,Gender differences in the willingness to engage in risky behavior: A terror management perspective,"Two studies examined the effects of mortality salience inductions on men and women's willingness to engage in risk-taking behaviors. In Study 1, a sample of American college students (N=101, aged 17-47 yrs) were exposed to either a mortality salient or a control condition and then rated their willingness to engage in a variety of risk-taking activities. In Study 2, a sample of Israeli high-school students (N=106, aged 15-17 yrs) completed a self-esteem measure, were exposed to either a mortality salient or control condition, and then rated their willingness to use various psychoactive substances that were offered in 3 different hypothetical scenarios. In both studies findings indicate that mortality salience led to higher willingness to engage in risky behaviors in men but not in women. Study 2 also reveals that self-esteem moderated the effect of mortality salience on the willingness to use psychoactive substances but only when they were offered by a friend. The discussion offers a terror management perspective of risk-taking behaviors.

1402,The collective nature of lone wolf terrorism: Anders Behring Breivik and the anti-Islamic social movement,"Anders Behring Breivik, a lone wolf terrorist, killed 77 people in two terrorist attacks in Norway in 2011. This study uses framing theory from social movement studies to compare his Manifesto with the rhetoric of the anti-Islamic movement that inspired him. The anti-Islamic movement has a dual, and sometimes inconsistent, collective action framing. On the one hand, they portray Islam as an existential threat to the West and a warlike enemy; on the other, they promote peaceful and democratic opposition. The potential for radicalization is thus immanent. This case study reveals the importance of seeing lone wolf terrorists as acting from rhetoric embedded in larger social movements. It further demonstrates, in detail, the subtle and complex ways in which political narratives rejecting terrorism and political violence still end up inspiring such acts.

1403,A grounded theory study of meaning-making coping and growth in combat veterans,"Meaning-making coping is an essential process for recovery from combat trauma. The meanings that combat veterans make after combat trauma, the meaning-based processes they utilize, and the social interactions they experience have not been compared across outcomes. This study was designed to shed light on this meaning-making coping process with four main goals. The first was to ascertain what combat veterans believe about their experiences. The second was to find out what meaning-making processes combat veterans utilize. The third was to understand how meaning-making coping is related to the significant relationships combat veterans have. The final question to be answered was to understand how these beliefs, meaning-making processes, and relationship interactions vary between combat veterans experiencing very different outcomes. This study utilized semi-structured interviews with 15 male combat veterans from the post 9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The sample consisted of 5 resilient combat veterans, 5 highly traumatized combat veterans, and 5 growth-oriented combat veterans. A grounded theory of meaning-making coping was developed for each group and compared to the others. Results suggest global beliefs to be the driving force behind the success or failure of meaning-based coping during and after combat. The adequate global beliefs of the resilient combat veterans led to low discrepancy of meaning which enhanced the ability of that combat veteran to see the experience of combat as a challenge to be overcome by improved mental and emotional focus and internal control. After their deployment they reported improved relationships with significant others. The insufficient global beliefs of the highly traumatized group and the initial beliefs of the growth-oriented group, by contrast, led to high discrepancy of meaning which led to a sense of existential threat, physiological and emotional flooding, and high symptomology. They also reported difficulties with most significant relationships and increased closeness with other highly traumatized combat veterans. The growth-oriented group reported congruent experiences with the highly traumatized group until some point after their deployment when they recall a change in their global beliefs. At this point, they reported that their beliefs and meaning-based coping styles began to emulate those of the resilient group. Further, instead of dissociating from others they began to rebuild relationships with significant others and seek out more effective and supportive relationships. Though the sample is small, the tentative, but identifiable differences between-groups are compelling. What is believed before combat affects the perception of and response to combat itself which in turn leads to different levels of effectiveness and ability to successfully cope afterward.

The present study explores how female body objectification may serve as a defense against unconscious existential fears. Drawing from terror management theory an experiment was designed to test the potential functionality of female body objectification. Men and women were primed to think about either their own mortality or an aversive control topic, and levels of body objectification were then assessed for both self- and other (women)-objectification. Findings supported the hypothesis that priming mortality would increase both self- and other-objectification among women, and self-objectification among those who derive self-esteem from their body. Implications for this research are discussed.

Ss were asked to identify descriptions of persons who might be perceived as upholding or threatening the cultural world view. Responses indicate that the polarization of outgroup targets in response to mortality primes was most pronounced for Ss with high self-esteem. The death–meaningless and death manipulations showed similar effects in support of the hypothesis, whereas, the meaningless manipulations had little or no impact.

1406,Effects of Mortality Salience on Evaluation of Ingroup and Outgroup Sources: The Impact of Pro-Versus Counterattitudinal Positions,"Past Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) research has demonstrated that mortality salience leads to favoritism toward ingroup members and derogation of outgroup members and to polarized attitudes toward the source of pro- and counter-attitudinal statements. In such research, the individual's group membership and the individual's worldview position were examined separately. Thus, when the individual's group membership was manipulated, one could normally assume that an outgroup member is counter-attitudinal and an ingroup member is pro-attitudinal. It is unclear, therefore, whether ingroup members elicited favoritism from mortality salient participants because of their group membership or because of their presumably pro-attitudinal position, or both. The authors present two studies in which the individual's group membership and attitudinal position are jointly manipulated. Results showed that among mortality salient participants, the outgroup member received favorable or unfavorable evaluations depending on his position, whereas the ingroup member received moderately positive evaluations regardless of the position taken.

1407,In the wake of 9/11:  The psychology of terror,"This book explores the emotions of despair, fear, and anger that arose after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the autumn of 2001. The authors analyze reactions to the attacks through the lens of Terror Management Theory, an existential psychological model that explains why humans react the way they do to the threat of death and how this reaction influences their post-threat cognition and emotion. The theory provides ways to understand and reduce terrorism's effect and possibly find resolutions to conflicts involving terrorism. The authors focus primarily on the reaction in the {US} to the 9/11 attack, but their model is applicable to all instances of terrorism, and they expand their discussion to include the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This book has practical implications and will be a resource for mental health practitioners, researchers, and anyone concerned with the causes and effects of terrorism.

1408,Self-esteem and bolstering: Testing major assumptions of terror management theory,"Examined assumptions of the terror management theory which posits that the awareness of one's mortality is the underlying motivation for much of social behavior. The authors investigated 3 aspects of this theory: (1) increased self-esteem in response to salient reminders of mortality, (2) contemplation of one's own death as opposed to anxiety about death in general, and (3) religious beliefs in moderating views regarding death. 100 Ss were asked to write answers to questions that asked them to think about either their own death, the death of a cancer patient, failing a test, or eating. Following the manipulation, Ss completed measures of self-esteem and anxiety, then instructed to list their strengths and weaknesses, thus providing an avenue for them to bolster their self-esteem. Results indicate that only high-religious Ss who received the test-anxiety manipulation bolstered their self-esteem, and Ss who received the personal death manipulation reported the greatest belief in an afterlife. The failure to support important assumptions of terror management theory is discussed.

A control group and a {MS} group were given an opportunity (1) to defend their cultural worldview by derogating an anti-Japan essay writer, and (2) to boost their value within their cultures by indicating a greater desire for high-status over low-status products. Replicating past research with Western samples, Japanese in a {MS} condition were more critical of the anti-Japan essay writer and they indicated a marginal tendency to prefer high- over low-status products, compared with a control group.

It is argued that death-threatening may evoke people's prevention focus concerns, thus, based on the effect of 'regulatory fit', prevention-framed messages may be more persuasive in mortality salient contexts than promotion-framed ones. In Study 1, 82 military personnel participated in a 2 (mortality salience: experimental/control group) x 2 (message framing: promotion vs. prevention) factorial experiment. The results support the aforementioned hypothesis. In Study 2 (N = 48), by using a subliminal perception task to manipulate mortality salience, it is found that people under death-threatening were faster in reacting to prevention-related words than people of control group.

1411,A Terror Management Perspective on Ageism,"In the present article, we present a theoretical perspective on ageism that is derived from terror management theory. According to the theory, human beings manage deeply-rooted fears about their vulnerability to death through symbolic constructions of meaning and corresponding standards of value. We extend this perspective to suggest that elderly individuals present an existential threat for the non-elderly because they remind us all that: (a) death is inescapable, (b) the body is fallible, and (c) the bases by which we may secure self-esteem (and manage death anxiety) are transitory. We review some recent empirical evidence in support of these ideas and then discuss possible avenues for combating ageism.

It is suspected that such tuition is stressful for some students more than for others. Terror management theory suggests that the mortality salience presented by cadaver dissections would heighten stress among those students with positive self-images. The present study sought to investigate the association between body esteem ({BE}) and cardiovascular stress reactivity to cadaver dissections. Methods: The study involved the measurement of cardiovascular stress responses in 36 anatomy students during a dissection class. Psychometric assessments of {BE} and other variables were taken. Results: Students with high {BE} had lower heart rate (P=.011) and exhibited greater decreases in systolic blood pressure (P=.008) and pulse pressure (P=.003) throughout the session, suggestive of maladaptive stress response. Conclusions: As findings are consistent with theories linking {BE} with stress in occupations that require workers to view dead bodies, the consideration of {BE} may be an effective component in stress reduction interventions.

The authors begin with an overview of the primary assumptions and propositions of terror management theory and a description of the initial research conducted to test the theory. They then present a detailed consideration of more recent research that (a) establishes the convergent and discriminant validity of our mortality salience treatment and the robustness of its effect through the use of alternative mortality salience treatments and comparison treatments, and replications by other researchers; (b) extends the range of interpersonal behaviors demonstrably influenced by terror management concerns; (c) demonstrates how mortality salience interacts with other theoretically relevant situational and dispositional variables; and (d) provides an account of the cognitive processes through which mortality salience produces its effects.

1416,The birth and death of belonging - The Oxford handbook of social exclusion.,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, \& Solomon, 1986) offers an evolutionary-existential-psychoanalytic perspective on the human motive to belong. According to this view, the evolution of sophisticated intellect allowed for consideration of the past and future in decision making, thereby freeing human beings from fixed response patterns. However, it also made humans uniquely aware of the inevitability of their own death. To manage potentially debilitating anxiety resulting from this awareness, humans have had to give up some of this freedom so as to feel securely embedded in a cultural meaning system (a cultural worldview) that provides meaning, self-worth, and a sense of immortality. Because other people are an important source of self-esteem and validation for cultural worldview beliefs, social connections with similar others are maintained to mitigate existential fear. A large empirical literature supporting this theoretical account is reviewed. Ensuing discussion considers how a {TMT} perspective can lend understanding to the multifarious reactions people have to social exclusion.

1417,"Subtle priming of shared human experiences eliminates threat-induced negativity toward Arabs, immigrants, and peace-making","Many studies demonstrate that mortality salience can increase negativity toward outgroups but few have examined variables that mitigate this effect. The present research examined whether subtly priming people to think of human experiences shared by people from diverse cultures increases perceived similarity of members of different groups, which then reduces {MS}-induced negativity toward outgroups. In Study 1, exposure to pictures of people from diverse cultures engaged in common human activities non-significantly reversed the effect of {MS} on implicit anti-Arab prejudice. In Study 2, thinking about similarities between one's own favorite childhood memories and those of people from other countries eliminated {MS}-induced explicit negative attitudes toward immigrants. In Study 3, thinking about similarities between one's own painful childhood memories and those of people from other countries eliminated the {MS}-induced reduction in support for peace-making. Mediation analyses suggest the effects were driven by perceived similarity of people across cultures. These findings suggest that priming widely shared human experiences can attenuate {MS}-induced intergroup conflict.

Study 1 related a newly developed measure of individual differences in sensitivity to boundary threat across these 3 domains to values and disgust sensitivity. Four subsequent studies focused on spatial-symbolic threat sensitivity and related it to right-wing authoritarianism, aversive reactions to unfamiliar out-groups, and revulsion to vermin. A final experiment illustrates how a salient spatial-symbolic threat (dust mites) can elicit reactions toward out-groups that closely parallel mortality salience effects observed in research inspired by terror management theory, even though dust mites do not elicit mortality concerns.

1419,No atheists in foxholes: Motivated reasoning and religious belief - Social and psychological bases of ideology and system justification.,"Although explanations of the existence of religious beliefs in terms of their satisfaction of psychological needs date back centuries, limited empirical research exists linking motivated reasoning to religious belief. I review past research on the role of motivation in the formation of religious belief systems, specifically research related to the relationship between fear of death and belief in the afterlife. I then present the results of two original experimental studies investigating the hypothesis that fear of death leads to greater religious belief. In Study 1, participants who were asked to write short essays about death reported greater belief in an afterlife than did participants who wrote essays on a neutral topic. Study 2 replicated this finding and also showed that increased fear of death leads to greater belief in God. The results of the studies suggest that a more parsimonious motivated reasoning account may explain the relationship between fear of death and afterlife belief better than one based on terror management theory. Taken together, findings support the notion that some religious beliefs can be usefully explained in motivational terms.

1420,In the face of terrorism: Evidence that belief in literal immortality reduces prejudice under terrorism threat,"Based on terror management theory, previous research has shown that terrorism threat increases prejudice against Muslims and is mediated by death-related thoughts. Because this effect was found on a correlational level, it remains unclear whether terrorism threat increases prejudice against Muslims because of enhanced death-related thoughts or the opposite: terrorism threat increases death-related thoughts because of stronger prejudice against Muslims. To disentangle this shortcoming, we varied death-related thoughts by systematically manipulating the belief in literal immortality. Using two studies, we found that participants exposed to terrorism pictures (vs. controls) had increased prejudice against both Muslims (Study 1) and immigrants (Study 2) when they were led to believe that literal immortality does not exist but not when they were led to believe that it does exist. Mediation analysis indicated that this effect was mediated by death-related thoughts. This provides further evidence that terrorism threat increases prejudice because of death-related thoughts.

1421,Empowering the self: Using the terror management health model to promote breast self-examination,"According to the terror management health model, when thoughts of death are non-consciously activated, health decisions should be influenced by identity-relevant motivations. Therefore, in this context, framing a health behavior as a tool to empower the self should increase intentions to engage in the behavior and enhanced feelings of empowerment after doing so. In Study 1, women for whom death thoughts were more accessible responded to an empowerment frame with increased breast self-exam intentions relative to women for whom death thoughts were less accessible. In Study 2, priming death led to increased empowerment feelings after conducting an exam framed as empowering. Discussion focuses on empowerment as a health promotion tool in contexts likely to activate non-conscious death thoughts.

1422,Negative emotions and political engagement - The political psychology of terrorism fears.,"The following observations emerge from this literature review of negative emotions and political engagement. First, political responses to terrorism are partly determined by the frequency, recency, and target of terrorist attacks and by prior attitudes about a government's right to aggression. Second, anxiety and fear are tied to unacceptably high risk, efforts to acquire and evaluate information about salient issues, and cautious political behavior, particularly among women and minorities. This inhibitory effect may not hold when threat is so profound that it precipitates risky aggressive responses aimed at ensuring survival. Third, anger lowers risk perceptions by increasing perceived control and strength, reduces information seeking and processing, and mobilizes adventurous political action to preserve a threatened worldview, particularly among older, less-educated white men. Fourth, risk perception, which is intensified by anxiety and fear and diminished by anger, conveys information that can guide political responses. Risk orientation is a dispositional variable that may account for stable emotional reactions and policy preferences that have varying probabilities of gain or loss. Fifth, women's elevated anxiety and fear, higher risk perception, and greater political caution may reflect their generalized vulnerability to harm, whereas the disregard for risk by white males seems to mirror their privileged and insulated worldview. Political conservatism is linked to a need for closure and for preserving collectively held moral values under threatening conditions, and predicts hostile ethnocentric political preferences. Sixth, several conceptual models have been developed or adapted to explain the association between negative emotions and political engagement: Affect Intelligence Theory, Appraisal Tendency Theory, Attachment Theory, Cognitive Calculus Model, Dual Process Theory, Ethnocentric Utilitarian Perspective, Intergroup Emotion Theory, Prospect Theory, Social Identity Theory, and Terror Management Theory. Each perspective sharpens and deepens the understanding and prediction of political engagement in circumstances that involve terrorism.

The hypothesis was confirmed, suggesting that depressed persons may prefer others who also tend toward depression. To examine this possibility, in Study 2 depressed and nondepressed Ss spoke with one another in either depressed–depressed, nondepressed–depressed, or nondepressed–nondepressed pairs. It was found that depressed Ss felt worse than nondepressed Ss after speaking with nondepressed targets, but not after speaking with depressed targets.

Though empirical support is lacking, such themes do suggest that religiosity may play a role in shaping the ways that people relate to the natural world. The present research used terror management theory to address this issue. It was hypothesized that death-relevant concerns would moderate the relationship between religious fundamentalism and feelings of connectedness to nature. Across three studies, religious fundamentalism negatively predicted feelings of connectedness to nature when death-relevant thoughts were activated. No such relationship emerged in the absence of death-relevant thought. The implications of these findings for better understanding the role of religion in human/nature relationships and current ecological issues are discussed.

New data reveal distinct neural and behavioral signatures of (de)humanizing responses to distinct kinds of ingroups and outgroups on these dimensions. The most dehumanized outgroups (low on both warmth and competence) elicit disgust and avoidance, devalued as literally worth-less. In contrast, groups disliked for seeming cold but respected for competence elicit envy and Schadenfreude. Reactions to pitied outgroups—disrespected for seeming incompetent, but apparently likable enough for seeming trustworthy and warm—focus on prescriptions for their behavior.

1428,Death anxiety: The challenge and the promise of whole person care - Whole person care: A new paradigm for the 21st century.,"This chapter discusses whole person health care and death anxiety. The uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing dread that is assuaged by perceiving oneself to be a valuable member of meaningful universe. Intimations of mortality stimulate efforts to remove thoughts of death from awareness, and nonconscious death thoughts instigate efforts to shore up self-esteem and reaffirm faith in cherished cultural values. Existing evidence (more is sorely needed) suggests that existential concerns affect patient outcomes as well as medical practitioner's diagnostic and treatment decisions. We believe these ideas accentuate the challenge and the promise of whole person care in the twenty-first century. In addition to mastering an enormous body of (rapidly burgeoning) information and acquiring and maintaining a host of sophisticated clinical skills, healthcare professionals devoted to the whole person care paradigm must also consider how illnesses (especially unexpected, severe, and terminal) threaten to puncture the delicate fabric of meaning necessary for constructive and satisfying human activity. This is a challenge for both healthcare professionals and patients. There is also another challenge for health professionals themselves. They need to recognize how their own nonconscious death fears.

1429,Self-Affirmation and Mortality Salience: Affirming Values Reduces Worldview Defense and Death-Thought Accessibility,"To the extent that cultural worldviews provide meaning in the face of existential concerns, specifically the inevitability of death, affirming a valued aspect of one's worldview should render reminders of death less threatening. The authors report two studies in support of this view. In Study 1, mortality salience led to derogation of a worldview violator unless participants had first affirmed an important value. In Study 2, self-affirmation before a reminder of death was associated with reduced accessibility of death-related thoughts a short while thereafter. The authors propose that actively affirming one's worldview alters reactions to reminders of mortality by reducing the accessibility of death-related thoughts, not by boosting self-esteem. These studies attest to the flexible nature of psychological self-defense and to the central role of cultural worldviews in managing death-related concerns.

1430,Review of Modern misogyny: Anti-feminism in a post-feminist era,"Reviews the book, Modern Misogyny: Anti-Feminism in a Post-Feminist Era by K. J. Anderson (2015). In this book, Anderson tackles a series of themes. First, she examines how the language of feminism has been co-opted to make choice—previously about reproductive control of women’s bodies—about consumerism. Then, she uses terror management theory to explain how the conservative movement capitalized on the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States to undermine the relatively recent gains in women’s rights by emphasizing the comfort and safety of more traditional values. In subsequent chapters, Anderson frequently uses conservative or anti-feminist writers’ words to emphasize their points of view and then disassembles their ideas and refutes their underlying assumptions piece-by-piece. Anderson’s narrative weaves together a cogent argument about why feminism is just as necessary as it ever was—or maybe, because of the backlash against it, more necessary than it ever was. In an academic setting, this book could be paired with other primary sources for an advanced undergraduate, capstone, or graduate course in social psychology or women’s studies for an in-depth examination of a number of different social psychological and feminist themes. It also lends itself to a pop culture or sociology course for related topics. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Muellerleile, Paige",0,,1429
1431,The functional nature of conspiracy beliefs: Examining the underpinnings of belief in the Da Vinci Code conspiracy,"Focusing on a contemporary conspiracy theory popularized in the novel The Da Vinci Code (Brown, 2002), we examined the underlying psychological factors and individual differences that may predict belief in conspiracy theories, and assessed such beliefs’ resistance to counterevidence. Our results suggest that belief in the Da Vinci Code conspiracy may be associated with coping with existential threat and death-related anxiety. In addition, the extent to which participants believed in the conspiracy was associated with the endorsement of congruent (New Age spiritual) and competing (Christian religious) beliefs, in opposite directions. Finally, exposure to counterevidence resulted in belief reduction, specifically among more religious participants (i.e. among those endorsing a competing belief system). We suggest that belief in modern conspiracy theories may help individuals attain or maintain a sense of meaning, control, and security.

1432,"Living, dying, and remembering: The encoding processes involved in survival processing - What is adaptive about adaptive memory?","This chapter explains that retention advantages due to reliance on survival situations are likely caused by differential processing of item-specific and relational processing. It is also argued that thinking of one's mortality might be regarded as a specialized function of memory. Rather than focus on ultimate explanations of the survival processing retention advantage, we concentrate on a possible proximate cause of the effect. We suggest that the survival-orienting task tends to encourage the encoding of both item-specific and relational properties of list items, whereas control conditions, including those involving nonsurvival scenarios, have tended to focus on either item-specific or relational properties. We also discuss recent research showing that simply priming individuals with mortality-salient themes enhances memory for subsequently processed material. We then discuss whether this newly discovered effect is related to survival processing, and if so, whether that insight might shed light on the origins of the survival processing advantage, as well as its mediating mechanisms. We conclude that the two phenomena may be related and that studying the effects of mortality salience on retention may help to illuminate nature's role in shaping memory.

1433,The effects of mortality salience and perceived terrorism threat on attitudes toward Muslim and Muslim Americans,"This study employed Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) to examine whether evoking thoughts about being in a terrorist attack would lead to a worldview defense similar to that which occurs when mortality is made salient. That is, it examined whether, participants would defend their cultural values and denigrate others who do not share those values. College students (/n/ = 165) from a rural community college and a large metropolitan university were exposed to one of three priming conditions: In the control condition, participants were to think about how they felt when they watched television; in the second condition, they were to think about how they felt about their death; in the third condition, they were asked how they would feel if they were caught in the middle of a terrorist attack. It was predicted that the level of worldview defense would be the lowest among subjects who were in the television (control) condition but would be higher among those in the mortality or terrorism salient (experimental) conditions (which would not differ from each other). It also examined whether there were between-group differences in attitudes towards Muslims and Muslim Americans. Contrary to expectations, there were no significant between-group differences found either in the levels of worldview defense or in attitudes towards Muslims and Muslim Americans. Similarly to previous studies, participants did not report any negative emotional effects from the mortality or terrorism priming conditions. Issues related to confounding variables that could have affected the results were discussed. Methods to control and to examine certain extraneous variables were also suggested for future studies.

1434,Coping with the inevitability of death: Terror management and mismanagement - Coping with stress:  Effective people and processes.,"Discussed in this chapter is the problem of coping with death anxiety from the perspective of Terror Management Theory. This theory provides an explanation for two fundamental human characteristics—the desire to maintain a favorable self-image (i.e., self-esteem) and the need to promote the truth of particular cultural worldviews—by recognizing the power that death anxiety holds over every human being. Thus, in the majority of the chapter the authors discuss Terror Management Theory and its explanations for coping with death anxiety in everyday life. The latter part of the chapter is dedicated to one of the more recent ideas to emerge from Terror Management theory; namely, the hypothesis that anxiety disorders (such as specific phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder) are maladaptive attempts to focalize this core human fear. As the point of transition between these two sections, the authors will consider the role of the personality trait known as neuroticism. The authors believe this trait is a reflection of how well (or poorly) people are able to buffer death anxiety via the mechanisms of self-esteem and belief in cultural standards of value.

1435,Understanding human ambivalence about sex: The effects of stripping sex of meaning,"We offer a theoretical perspective to provide insight into why people are ambivalent about sex and why cultures regulate sex and attach symbolic meaning to it. Building on terror management theory, we propose that sex is problematic for humankind in part because it reminds us of our creaturely mortal nature. Two experiments investigated the effects of reminding people of the similarity between humans and other animals on their reactions to the physical aspects of sex. In Study 1, priming human-animal similarities led to increased accessibility of death-related thoughts after thinking about the physical but not romantic aspects of sex. In Study 2, when participants were reminded of similarities between humans and other animals, mortality salience resulted in decreased attraction to the physical but not romantic aspects of sex. In each study, priming thoughts about how humans are distinct from animals eliminated the association between sex and death.

1436,Defensive versus existential religion: Is religious defensiveness predictive of worldview defense?,"Beck (2004) has recently argued that, although existential defensiveness may motivate some religious persons, existential engagement is compatible with religious belief. More specifically, Beck (2004) has argued that 'defensive believers' tend to adopt theological configurations mainly aimed at producing existential solace and consolation. Consequently, one of Beck's (2004) contentions is that 'defensive believers' would display in-group bias in order to preserve the integrity of their worldview. By contrast, 'existential believers,' due to their existential engagement, are predicted to display less in-group bias. This article presents two empirical studies aimed at testing these characterizations. First, in Study 1 a measure of existential defensiveness, the Defensive Theology Scale, was constructed and then compared with measures of Quest religious motivation and religious pluralism. Study 2, a laboratory study, borrowed a common experimental procedure from Terror Management Theory research. Specifically, defensive and existential participants were moved through a mortality salience manipulation with subsequent ratings of in-group and out-group targets. Overall, the results of Studies 1 and 2 supported Beck's (2004) characterizations. That is, religiously defensive participants scored lower on Quest motives and displayed the tendency to see in-group targets more favorably than out-group targets. Conversely, existential participants scored higher on Quest motives and tended to see in-group and out-group targets as equally attractive or capable.

1437,The belief in a just world: Terror management defense mechanism or autonomous motive?,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) conceptualizes the belief in a just world ({BJW}) as a worldview to maintain when mortality is salient (Hirschberger, 2006). Just world theorists see {BJW} as an autonomous motive that may underlie mortality salience ({MS}) effects (death thoughts are threatening when associated with injustice; Hafer, 2002). Two studies examined the motive underlying {MS} effects. In Study 1 participants (N = 101) completed a three-level {MS} manipulation (death, dental pain, chronic pain), a word completion (death, justice, control words), and a modified Stroop task (death, justice, control words). Compared to dental pain, death salient participants evidenced greater death accessibility and justice threat. Study 1 findings suggest that {MS} induces justice rather than death threat. In Study 2 participants (N = 154) completed individual difference measures (e.g., religious belief, death perspectives), were exposed to a 3 level {MS} manipulation, word completion, and a modified Stroop. Participants were exposed to a news story about either a severely suffering (high {JW} threat) or mildly suffering (low {JW} threat) innocent victim; attributions of blame were assessed. Study 2 found that a) those with strong afterlife beliefs may be protected from justice threat in reaction to {MS}; b) under {MS} individuals attributed less blame to a severely injured innocent victim; c) those in the dental pain condition defensively blamed a severely injured innocent victim more than a mildly injured one; d) participants in the paralysis salient condition demonstrated more sympathy for the suffering of the victim and did not attribute more blame to the severely injured victim. Findings suggest that people can experience justice or death threat in response to mortality salience, but the type of threat experienced and the ways people manage it may rely on individual differences.

1438,Attitudes toward governmental use of torture: The impact of mortality salience and humanization,"Torture is prevalent in many modern societies, democratic and otherwise. It is important therefore to understand public opinion regarding the use of torture and the social-psychological processes underlying such opinions. Terror Management Theory posits that when individuals are reminded of their own mortality they retaliate, sometimes violently, against those seen as a threat to their cultural worldview or way of life. Dehumanization is posited to be a psychological mechanism that reduces the stress associated with causing harm, making it easier to support harm-doing. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of mortality salience and the impact of humanizing the victim on attitudes toward use of torture. Study participants were first year college students from a large mid-western university. The study used a 2x2 post-test experimental design adapted from the design used by the proponents of Terror Management Theory. A series of {ANOVAs} and regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between attitudes toward use of torture and (a) mortality salience and (b) humanization of a victim. Analyses were also conducted to examine the relationship between attitudes toward use of torture and other demographic variables such as age, gender, years of education, race, religion and political orientation. Results did not show any significant effects for mortality salience or for humanization of the victim. Descriptive statistics suggested that respondents were more certain of what constitutes torture than of whether its use is legitimate, refraining from taking a stand for or against it. Furthermore, significant correlations indicate that as the likelihood of perceiving certain interrogational techniques as 'torture' increases, the favorability for the use of such techniques decreases. Additionally, results indicated that those with a more liberal political orientation had less favorable views toward use of torture by their government and that women tended to have less favorable views than men. The implications and limitations of this study, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.

1439,Unusual but sound minds: Mental health indicators in spiritual individuals,"Previous research has linked certain types of modern spirituality, including New Age and Pagan, with either benign schizotypy or insecure attachment. While the first view emphasizes a positive aspect of spiritual believers’ mental health (benign schizotypy), the second view emphasizes a negative aspect, namely the unhealthy emotional compensation associated with an insecure attachment style. This study addresses these two conflicting views by comparing a sample of modern spiritual individuals (N = 114) with a contrast group of traditional religious believers (N = 86). Measures of schizotypy and attachment style were combined with mental health scales of anxiety and depression. We further assessed death anxiety to determine whether modern spiritual beliefs fulfilled a similar function as traditional religious beliefs in the reduction of existential threat. Our results support a psychological contiguity between traditional and modern spiritual believers and reinforce the need to de-stigmatize spiritual ideas and experiences. Using hierarchical regression, we showed that unusual experiences and ideas are the major predictor of engagement in modern spiritual practices. Anxiety, depression variables, and insecure attachment were not significant predictors of spirituality or correlated with them; on the other hand, the results show that spiritual believers report high social support satisfaction and this variable predicts involvement in modern spirituality. Further, spiritual practices were negatively correlated with and negatively predicted by death anxiety scores. Overall, the results strengthen the association between modern spirituality, good mental health, and general well-being.

1440,"Low-prejudiced people, their ideals, and outgroup overcompensation","The behavior and subsequent affect of people low in prejudice were examined in four experiments. In Study 1, 52 people evaluated two targets differing primarily in sexual orientation and then completed mood and prejudice measures. Although people high in prejudice discriminated against a homosexual target, people low and moderate in prejudice favored this target. In Study 2, 57 people were given target intellectual ability information designed to either challenge or not challenge any propensity towards the outgroup favoritism observed in Study 1. Specifically, study participants evaluated either a more qualified homosexual and a less qualified heterosexual (not challenging outgroup favoritism) or a less qualified homosexual and a more qualified heterosexual (challenging outgroup favoritism). Although low prejudiced people favored the homosexual target when he was better qualified, they were unwilling to make this same distinction when the heterosexual target was more qualified. Study 3 was designed to understand if such overcompensation results from a need to restore social justice. Study participants (n = 77) were made to believe their peers were either discriminatory, overcompensatory, or neutral towards a minority member. As expected for low prejudiced people, only by making them believe their peers overcompensate a minority group member, thereby eliminating any extant need to restore social justice, was outgroup favoritism eliminated. Finally, Study 4 assessed the extent to which the low prejudiced person's tendency to overcompensate a minority member rests on a well-internalized system of beliefs. Following a (mortality salience) manipulation designed either to engage or not engage the internalized belief system, 35 low prejudiced people completed the same procedure employed in Study 1. Results revealed increased overcompensation of a homosexual for participants whose internalized beliefs were engaged. Further, in all four studies, participants failed to manifest self-discrepancy related affect after the target evaluations. It was, therefore, concluded that the outgroup favoritism observed for low prejudiced people is consistent with a desire to correct for social 'wrongs' which appears to stem from well-entrenched beliefs that are likely compatible with affirmative action decision-making.

1441,"Disgust, creatureliness and the accessibility of death-related thoughts","From an existential terror management theory perspective, disgusting stimuli are threatening to human beings because they make salient people's vulnerability to death. Two studies were designed to assess this proposition by measuring implicit death-related ideation after individuals were presented with stimuli that either were or were not disgusting, under conditions in which the similarities of humans to other animals or the uniquely human aspects of people were made salient. In Study 1, in which rather extreme disgust-eliciting pictures were used, disgusting stimuli led to higher death-thought accessibility than neutral pictures regardless of whether or not participants had previously been primed with similarities between humans and other animals. In Study 2, in which milder verbal disgust-eliciting stimuli were used, disgusting stimuli led to heightened death-thought accessibility only when human-animal similarities were first primed.

1442,"Freedom versus fear revisited: An integrative analysis of the dynamics of the defense and growth of self - Handbook of self and identity., 2nd ed.","The present chapter addresses four basic questions about the self: why it evolved, what functions it serves, why it must be defended, and how growth of the self is possible. To address these questions, we take an existential perspective that starts by positing that human beings are animals, living organisms in a seemingly purposeless universe; material transient beings struggling to eat, survive, and procreate, but fated to die; and, most importantly, painfully aware of this inevitable reality. Greenberg, Pyszczynski, and Solomon (1995) explored the interplay of two motive systems—defense and expansion of the self—and proposed a dual-motive depth psychology building primarily on the work of Otto Rank and Ernest Becker. In this chapter, we further develop this analysis, primarily by utilizing two empirically based contemporary theories: One, terror management theory, has focused primarily on defense of the self, and the other, self-determination theory, has focused primarily on growth of the self. We lean heavily on these theories, along with relevant research, to approach an integrated view of these two basic motives of the self.

1443,The effects of a self-esteem boost and mortality salience on responses to boost relevant and irrelevant worldview threats,"Assessed whether raising self esteem attenuates mortality salience effects on reactions to cultural worldview treats when a target specifically threatened the dimension on which the boost was predicated. Ss were 33 male and 60 female college students who self identified as moderately to totally committed to their majors of psychology, business, or education. Ss (1) received positive personality feedback emphasizing likelihood of success either in their major or a different domain or neutral feedback, (2) contemplated their mortality or a control topic, and (3) evaluated targets threatening beliefs about the {US} and the S's major. Replicating earlier findings, after mortality salience, neutral feedback S derogated the anti-{US} target, whereas positive feedback Ss did not. However, if the feedback mentioned Ss' major, mortality salience led to derogation of the anti-major target, even if the feedback was positive. It is concluded that these findings indicate that when a target threatens a dimension on which a self esteem boost is predicated, such a boost will not deter derogation following mortality salience.

1444,The effects of death reminders on sex differences in prejudice toward gay men and lesbians,"Terror management research shows that death reminders (mortality salience) increase prejudice toward worldview violators. Two studies investigated whether death reminders exacerbated differences in heterosexual men’s and women’s reports of sexual prejudice (negative attitudes based on sexual orientation). Results showed that following death reminders, sex differences in anti-gay discrimination and affective prejudice toward gay men (but not toward lesbians) were larger, and that these increased sex differences were mediated by gender role beliefs. The current studies suggest that researchers may attenuate the effects of death reminders by lessening the perceived worldview violation in addition to alleviating the existential terror of death.

1445,"An existential perspective on violent solutions to ethno–political conflict - Human aggression and violence: Causes, manifestations, and consequences.","How can we explain that despite mounting evidence of the futility of violence, and the obvious need for reconciliation among the various factions, there seems to be no end in sight to perpetual warfare between Israel, Palestine, and other nations in the Middle East? And why has every step taken toward peace paradoxically resulted in a spiral of bitter violence? One possible answer that many Israelis and Palestinians seem to adhere to is that the other side has proven to be duplicitous, inhumane, and ruthless, using peace as a cover for malevolent intentions. In the present chapter we provide an alternative answer to these questions and argue that powerful psychological forces underlying ethno–political conflict hamper the ability to achieve peace, even when peace seems to be a rational solution that would benefit all. We base our analysis on terror management theory and demonstrate, with a body of research conducted recently in Iran, Israel, Europe, and the United States, how existential concerns underlie the proclivity to choose violent solutions to ethno–political conflicts. We also show that the link between mortality concerns and ethno–political violence is not inevitable, and that at times mortality concerns can even reduce violent inclinations. We suggest that a better understanding of the role played by mortality concerns in political reasoning provides insight into ways to move beyond violence and to promote peace.

1446,Eternal youths: A narrative inquiry into the buffering effects of a generational cultural complex against the anxiety of aging and death in the American baby boom generation,"This research explored 39American Baby Boomers' attitudes towards aging, death and dying, and whether or not a belief in a generational cultural worldview of youthfulness buffered the individual against anxiety of eventual death. Thematic analysis informed by narrative inquiry explored responses from these participants. The online service {SurveyMonkey} was used to gather data via a narrative answer questionnaire. Death anxiety, from a Western cultural perspective, is a complex phenomenon that represents the blend of many different thought processes and emotions. Terror management theory posited that humans share with all forms of life a biological predisposition to continue their existence, or at least to avoid premature termination of life, while at the same time having knowledge of their inevitable mortality. As a result, humans have the potential to consciously experience a terror of death. Therefore, self-esteem and cultural systems serve as shields against the human awareness of vulnerability and eventual mortality. Cultural complex is a theoretical term that extends Jung's original conception of a complex into group phenomena. Whole groups can often behave as if they are in the grip of a specific cultural complex. This type of cultural complex activates in the groups' behavior, emotion, and life as a self-preservation system. With regard to this study, the cultural complex under study was an observed preservation of ongoing youthfulness of a generation collectively known as the Baby Boomers in the United States. This research asked the following question: Have the Baby Boomers invested in a cultural complex of youthfulness to help buffer anxiety about aging and death? The findings of this study may contribute to the integration of psychological, thanatological, transpersonal, and sociological theories in evolving theoretical models for working with a population that, through sheer volume of numbers, is changing how Americans cope with aging and mortality.

1447,"Feeling queasy about the Incarnation: Terror management theory, death, and the body of Jesus","Throughout Christian history, at different times and places, believers have expressed ambivalence regarding the Incarnation. There has always been something scandalous and shocking about God taking a fully human form. What is the source of this discomfort? Recent work in Terror Management Theory has shown that people feel ambivalent toward their bodies and bodily functions because the body functions as a mortality/death reminder. If this analysis is correct it might explain why many Christians, from the earliest days of the church, have resisted the notion of the Incarnation. Thus, it was the thesis of this study that existential concerns are intimately involved in Incarnational ambivalence. The study sought to test this formulation by assessing Incarnational ambivalence, death anxiety, and other facets of an existential faith orientation to determine if existential fears were implicated in Incarnational ambivalence. Overall, the results of the study supported the predictions. Respondents reporting greater death anxiety and displaying a more 'closed' faith orientation, existentially speaking, were the most likely to reject strong body-scenarios involving Jesus, finding these scenarios uncomfortable, demeaning to Jesus, unrealistic, and unbiblical.

1448,The psychological consequences of terrorist alerts - Psychology of terrorism.,"This chapter presents a theoretically informed critique of the current system of terrorist alarms. Terrorist alerts produce both political and psychological effects. Politically, terrorist warnings mobilize first responders as well as the public to increased vigilance, for example. However, while ostensibly designed to improve the effectiveness of homeland defense, terrorist alerts also result in various negative outcomes. In this chapter we concentrate on three such specific problems. First, raising--as well as lowering--terrorist alarms produces negative public mental health outcomes and increases depression and posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) in the population at large. Second, this system encourages unthinking support for standing, charismatic leadership through a combination of heightened in-group bias and mortality salience. Last, the current system of terrorist alerts poses a threat to the diverse political culture on which our current governmental system rests. We begin with a brief history of the use and implementation of the color-coded scheme. Next, we present evidence summarizing the counterproductive impact of this system on the national state of mental health. In short, we argue that the impact of this system does the terrorists' work for them by inducing a destructive degree of anxiety, depression, and paralysis in the population at large. Then we combine two theoretical models, social identity theory and terror management theory, both drawn from social psychology, to help explain how the current system encourages support for standing, charismatic leadership. We then discuss the reason that government leaders may have political and strategic incentives to continue to employ the current system despite the widespread mental health damage it incurs. Next we draw on these earlier arguments to explain how and why the current system poses threats to democratic values we should cherish. Finally, we offer some suggestions for how to develop a more effective and less destructive terrorist alert system.

1449,An investigation of the relationship between political ideology and mortality salience,"Terror Management Theory researchers have claimed that politically liberal and conservative individuals respond differently in their evaluation of dissimilar and similar targets following reminders of death due to differences in ideologies, for example, the value of tolerance being of greater value for liberals than conservatives. However, Motivated Social Cognition researchers have asserted that the evidence in the literature points to a similar response in the evaluation of dissimilar and similar targets. Three studies are presented which aimed to clarify and resolve this debate. Study 1 adds support for the terror management argument by revealing that liberals became less authoritarian when primed with death-related thoughts. Study 2 replicates Study 1 by using a different dependent measure. Finally, Study 3 demonstrates similar findings with a more comprehensive set of dependent variables.

Method: Subjects were Israeli youth who were exposed to terror (n = 2,999) aged 13–15. Measures included: posttraumatic growth inventory, religious orientation, ideological commitment, objective and subjective exposure to terror. Results: Both religiosity and political ideology mediated the effects of exposure and fear on growth. Political ideology but not religiosity, had a moderating effect, such that subjective fear was positively associated with growth only among those with stronger ideologies. Conclusion: Results support the contention of Terror Management Theory that cultural beliefs have beneficial effects on well being in the face of adversity and emphasize the role of cultural world as effecting growth, beyond trauma.

We addressed this question in an East-Asian culture (China) that places particularly high value on familial self. Familial self-affirmation (compared to other forms of self-affirmation as well as low affirmation) curtailed the mortality salience–induced intolerance to birth-control policy (Experiment 1), reduced female participants’ performance detriments—due to stereotype threat—on mental rotation (Experiment 2), and diminished the disadvantageous influence of negative feedback on further interest in information about one’s weaknesses (Experiment 3). Close other self-affirmation, devoid of family context, was no more potent than individual self-affirmation or low affirmation. The findings underscore the utility of distinguishing among different sources of self-affirmation, highlight the relevance of familial self-affirmation to self-affirmation theory, and call for research testing the germaneness of familial self (and, more generally, the construct of family) in other Eastern, as well as Western, cultures.

1453,When self-enhancement drives health decisions: Insights from a terror management health model - Handbook of self-enhancement and self-protection.,"There are a variety of factors that influence people's health-relevant decisions. Many are directly associated with the implications of the behavior for health, whereas others appear to emanate from psychological motives that on the surface have little logical connection to the health-relevant outcomes of people's behavior. In this chapter, we focus primarily on the latter, seeking to understand how the motives for self-enhancement and self-protection can affect everyday health decisions. As this volume attests, such motives are widespread in their effects and implications. But stepping back, we might wonder why it is that people should have so trenchant a need to enhance and protect themselves that, in the service of this motive, they would forgo protecting their physical health. Our goal here is to provide one answer to this basic question and to show how this answer can inform an understanding of the pervasive influence that self-enhancement motives can have on health-relevant decisions and when that influence is most apt to occur. We focus specifically on a recently proposed terror management health model ({TMHM}; Goldenberg \& Arndt, 2008) to explicate how deeply rooted awareness of mortality gives rise to a pressing need for self-esteem, which, in turn, becomes a motive often implicated in the decisions people make with respect to their health. We begin with a brief consideration of some common themes to emerge from health psychology research and then turn to the question of why it is that people may be so powerfully driven to enhance and protect the self. We then integrate these insights with a presentation of {TMHM}, with a particular focus on recent research revealing how concerns about mortality engage self-enhancement motives in the context of decisions about health.

1454,Does a threat appeal moderate reckless driving? A terror management theory perspective,"A series of 2 studied examined the effects of threat appeals on reckless driving from a terror management theory perspective. In both studies, all the male participants (N = 109; aged 18–21 yrs) reported on the relevance of driving to their self-esteem, and then, half of them were exposed to a road trauma film and the remaining to a neutral film. In Exp 1, the dependent variable was the self-report of intentions to drive recklessly in hypothetical scenarios. In Exp 2, the dependent variable was actual behavior (driving speed) in a driving simulator. Findings indicate that a road trauma film led to less reported intentions of reckless driving but to higher driving speed than a neutral film. A discussion emphasizing the self-enhancing mechanisms proposed by the terror management theory is presented.

1455,The paradox of expressing speechless terror: Ritual liminality in the creative arts therapies’ treatment of posttraumatic distress,"Western treatment protocols for psychological trauma often prescribe recitation of narratives, despite evidence that the human brain’s storage of traumatic memories undermines verbalization. Creative arts therapists overcome this paradox in trauma recovery through nonlinguistic communication. Ethnographic research among holistic groups that rely on cultural rites, rather than words, as instruments of healing in the wake of massive violence can enrich creative arts approaches. Relevant case material, analyzed with reference to theories of ritual structure, is used to illustrate the interplay of symbolization, ceremony, and the verbal and nonverbal among war-affected children from the developing world. Included is the author’s venture into psychological syncretism in Sierra Leone. There, the fusion of locally inspired expression with dance/movement therapy improvisation facilitated recovery in a group of boy combatants.

1456,Why do we need what we need? A terror management perspective on the roots of human social motivation,"Used terror management theory to address the question of why people are motivated to achieve a variety of specific psychological end states. The authors argue that the most basic of all human motives is an instinctive desire for continued life, and that all more specific motives are rooted in this basic evolutionary adaptation. The authors proposed a tripartite motive system through which this prime directive for continued life is achieved, along with a hierarchical model of the relation between motives at different levels of abstraction. The 3 branches of this hierarchy consist of (1) direct biological motives (attaining the biological necessities of life); (2) symbolic-defensive motives (controlling the potential for existential terror brought on by awareness of the impossibility of continued satisfaction of the self-preservation instinct); and (3) self-expansive motives (growth and expansion of competencies and internal representations of reality). To illustrate the integrative utility of this analysis, the authors discuss the role of superordinate symbolic terror management needs in the pursuit of cognitive consistency, belief in a just world, self-awareness related behavior, self-esteem, social identity, impression management, and the control of others' worldviews.

1457,The role of death in life: Existential aspects of human motivation - The Oxford handbook of human motivation.,"The capacity for self-reflection, which plays an important role in human self-regulation, also leads people to become aware of the limitations of their existence. Awareness of the conflict between one's desires (e.g., to live) and the limitations of existence (e.g., the inevitability of death) creates the potential for existential anxiety. In this chapter, we review how this anxiety affects human motivation and behavior in a variety of life domains. Terror management theory and research suggest that transcending death and protecting oneself against existential anxiety are potent needs. This protection is provided by an anxiety-buffering system, which imbues people with a sense of meaning and value that function to shield them against these concerns. We review evidence of how the buffering system protects against existential anxiety in four dimensions of existence: the physical, personal, social, and spiritual domains. Because self-awareness is a prerequisite for existential anxiety, escaping self-awareness can also be an effective way to obviate the problem of existence. After elaborating on how existential anxiety can motivate escape from self-awareness, we conclude the chapter with a discussion of remaining issues and directions for future research and theory development.

1459,Illuminating the Dark Side of Creative Expression: Assimilation Needs and the Consequences of Creative Action Following Mortality Salience,"Previous research indicates that mortality salience and creative behavior combine to increase feelings of guilt, presumably over the disruption to social connection elicited by the call for innovative expression. The present studies examined whether satiating assimilation motives by highlighting conformity to others reduces this effect (Study 1) and facilitates positive psychological engagement (Study 2). Study 1 used a 2 (conformity vs. neutral feedback) × 2 (mortality salience vs. control) × 2 (creative task vs. noncreative task) design and had participants complete a self-report measure of guilt. Study 2 used a 2 (mortality salience vs. control) × 2 (other goal task vs. self-goal task) design, and after a creativity exercise, had participants complete measures of positive mood, vitality, and creative problem solving. Results indicated attending to assimilation needs reduced the elevated guilt that follows the juxtaposition of mortality salience and creative behavior and also increased a sense of positive engagement.

1460,"Emerging sense of continuity when facing death and trauma: The processing of grief, the management of terror and the restoration of personal growth and social relatedness - Studies of grief and bereavement.","The dilemma how to sustain an integrative and continual sense of self when facing the deconstructive power of approaching death, is the topic of this chapter. Conventional stepwise models of bereavement are currently being challenged by highly individualized and creative strategies of coping with grief and the emotional aftermath of loss. In his book The Broken Connection [1979] Robert Jay Lifton advocates for a 'Protean Self where processing and continuity are vital aspects of the self when facing one's own mortality as well as the collapse or collective breakdown of entire social systems as we grew to know them. He claims the resilient, ever flexible and multi faceted sense of self is better equipped to face the threat of trauma and death. When the Sense of Continuity of Life is restored rather than demolished when facing death or in the aftermath of life threatening trauma, we encounter a remarkable psychic phenomenon termed Post Traumatic Personal Growth. Furthermore, whenever interpersonal and social rifts and conflicts that may result in injury, loss or death are addressed by restorative practices rather than by punishment, violence and retaliatory destruction, we witness a rare capacity to transform rage, pain or despair into acts of healing and repair for the individual and for his or her community. This chapter will assert that by extension of the self both spatially (in restoring relatedness) and temporally (by employing capacities for abstraction, memory and imagery) the emerging Self as Process transcends to higher levels of Koestler's [1967] 'holarchies' in dealing with trauma and death.

1461,"Identifying young Muslims susceptible to violent radicalisation: Psychological theory and recommendations - Suicide bombers: The psychological, religious and other imperatives.","Much of the psychological debate on European home-grown Islamic terrorism leaves out the wider societal context from which the phenomenon arises. In this essay we examine the social psychological research relevant to understanding Islamic terrorism, beginning with an explanation of the wider societal forces impinging upon individuals in post-material societies. We then discuss the social psychological processes—congruent with this wider societal context—that increase the possibility of terrorism. In line with the evidence that terrorists who self-radicalise or are recruited come from ordinary social strata, these processes are very much part of universal human social and psychological functioning. We also consider how young Muslims draw upon available religious resources to actively construct their identities and choose courses of action. Both the structuralist approach (in which social processes are seen to impinge upon individuals) and the phenomenological approach (in which individuals are seen to construct their own identities and world views) are utilised. Research from both traditions intersects when thinking complexity is considered, and both approaches feed into our recommendations for identifying the social niches vulnerable to violent radicalisation.

The purpose of this review was to consolidate the conceptual understanding of demoralization and argue for its existence as a psychiatric syndrome. The history of the construct is explored, including the nature of existential distress and related psychological conditions that precipitate demoralization. Recent definitions of demoralization are described and differentiated from similar constructs. Future directions are highlighted, specifically in relation to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of demoralization in palliative care. Overall, demoralization is a clinically useful construct for those facing existential threat, guiding the clinician toward efforts to restore morale, meaning, and purpose.

1463,To boldly go where no one has gone before:  The impact of creativity and openness to experience on exploration after mortality salience,"Research derived from terror management theory indicates that mortality salience increase defense of one's own cultural beliefs. This suggests that mortality salience should decrease interest in exploring new ideas because such strivings may undermine the security provided by one's own culture. However, research also suggests that it may be possible to increase exploration after mortality salience. The current study builds from prior work to examine questions related to the effects of mortality salience and creativity on exploration. First, it was found that mortality salience does decrease exploration, but only for those high in openness to experience. It was further found that engaging in a creativity task or being made salient of the value of creativity eliminated this effect. However, for individuals low in openness to experience, after mortality salience, engaging in creative behavior decreased exploration whereas being made salient of the cultural value of creativity did not. Implications are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Routledge, Clay",1,,1462
1464,"Death without God: Religious struggle, death concerns, and depression in the terminally ill","Religious worldviews often provide comfort near the end of life, but they can cause distress if life circumstances are perceived as evidence of God's disfavor. This study, the first to test terror management theory ({TMT}) with terminally ill participants, examined the hypothesis that concerns about death mediate the relationship between religious struggle (and religious comfort) and depression in the terminally ill. Ninety-eight patients with end-stage congestive heart failure ({CHF}) completed measures of religious comfort, religious struggle, belief in an afterlife, concerns about death, and depression. In separate hierarchical linear regression models that controlled for degree of belief in an afterlife, death concerns fully mediated the relationships between religious struggle and depression and between religious comfort and depression. These findings suggest that religious struggle is a breakdown in the terror management system that leaves the individual vulnerable to the terror of death, and that properly functioning religious worldviews offer comfort by buffering the individual against death concerns.

In particular, the aesthetic experience of self-modifying feelings, which allow for the recognition of shared experiences between characters, humankind, and oneself, were hypothesized to serve as a way of bolstering one's cultural worldview and alleviating death anxiety. Study 1 did not support the hypothesis that self-modifying feelings were more likely to occur after mortality salience. Study 2 and subsequent exploratory analyses did identify self-modifying feelings as related to death thought accessibility after watching a television episode; however, this was in the opposite direction as expected. Additional types of feelings and personality traits are also considered for their function of narratives. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Maier, Julia",0,,1464
1466,Currencies as cultural symbols--an existential psychological perspective on reactions of Germans toward the Euro,"From the perspective of terror management theory, reminders of mortality should intensify the desire to maintain faith in one's own cultural worldview. We investigated this notion with regard to reactions of Germans towards a recent political-economic issue, the introduction of the new European currency, the Euro. In Study 1 we found among students that a mortality salience prime led to a decreased liking of the new European currency compared to a control prime. However, the attitude towards the German Mark was not significantly affected by mortality salience. Study 2 replicated the decreased liking of the Euro for a sample of older pedestrians who were interviewed in front of a cemetery compared to participants who were interviewed several blocks away. In addition, mortality salient participants also revealed a marginal increased liking of the German Mark. Moreover, similar findings occurred on a general composite measure of preference for German items over non-German items. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

1467,Sexual harassment in a terrifying world: Mortality salience and hostile workplace sexual harassment,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) contends that an awareness of one's mortality can cause debilitating fears in humans, who avoid this potentially incapacitating terror by increasing their faith in relevant cultural worldviews, thus increasing their sense of well-being and security (Solomon, Greenberg, \& Pyszczynski, 1991). The current studies attempted to determine whether mortality salience enhances hostile sexism (stereotypes associated with an antipathy toward women) and benevolent sexism (stereotypes associated with protectionist attitudes toward woman), potential worldviews that influence decision-makers' sexual harassment evaluations. Across three studies, mortality salient participants (primed with mortality-related thoughts), control participants (primed with emotion-based, non-death related thoughts), and neutral participants (neither emotionally nor mortality primed), viewed two sexual harassment films and evaluated the complainants' sexual harassment claims. Hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes were measured using the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Glick \& Fiske, 1996). Using 62 male and 68 female undergraduates, study one attempted to determine whether mortality salience enhances hostile sexist attitudes (which should result in lower sexual harassment ratings) and benevolent sexist attitudes (which should increase sexual harassment ratings). Study one showed little impact of mortality salience on harassment decisions. Study two strengthened mortality salience by engaging 80 males and 83 females in either experiential processing (a gut-level, heuristic-based cognitive style) or rational processing (a deliberative, in-depth cognitive style), components of the Cognitive Experiential Self-Theory (Epstein \& Pacini, 1999). Mortality salience had spurious and contradictory effects in study two, though intriguing processing effects emerged for females, with experientially processing females using their hostile and benevolent sexist beliefs to a greater extent than rationally processing females. Processing did not impact males. Study three used a legally relevant mechanism to evaluate the impact of mortality salience on sexual harassment, altering the legal standard with which 78 males and 82 females evaluated harassment. Half the participants used the reasonable woman standard while remaining participants used the reasonable person standard. Standard and mortality salience had little impact, though hostile sexism predicted lower harassment ratings.

1468,Mother's Milk: An Existential Perspective on Negative Reactions to Breast-Feeding,"Drawing from an existential perspective rooted in terror management theory, four studies examined the hypothesis that breast-feeding women serve as reminders of the physical, animal nature of humanity and that such recognition is threatening in the face of one's unalterable mortality. Study 1 demonstrated that mortality salience ({MS}) led to more negative reactions toward a scenario depicting a woman breast-feeding her infant in public, and in Study 2, {MS} decreased liking and increased physical avoidance of a potential task partner described as breastfeeding in another room. Further supporting the hypothesis that such reactions are rooted in threats associated with human creatureliness, {MS} in conjunction with a breast-feeding prime led to an increase in the accessibility of creaturely related cognitions (Study 3) and priming human/animal similarities (i.e., creatureliness) led to increased negativity toward a magazine cover depicting a woman breast-feeding her child (Study 4).

1469,Structured terror: Further exploring the effects of mortality salience and personal need for structure on worldview defense,"Previous research indicates that people respond to heightened death-related cognition with increased defense of predominant cultural beliefs (cultural worldview defense). However, recent research indicates that individual differences in personal need for structure ({PNS}) impact responses to threatening thoughts of death such that those high, but not low, in {PNS} respond to death thoughts by seeking a highly structured, clear, and coherent view of the world. Research has yet to fully consider the extent to which {PNS} affects the cultural worldview defenses typically exhibited after death is rendered salient. The current 3 studies examine the potential for {PNS} to determine the extent to which people respond to mortality salience with increased worldview defense. In all three studies {PNS} was measured and mortality salience induced. Subsequently, university-related (Study 1) or religious (Studies 2 and 3) worldview defense was assessed. Only individuals high in {PNS} responded to mortality salience with increased worldview defense.

1470,Looking away from death: Defensive attention as a form of terror management,"Previous research has suggested that the physical aspects of human nature in general, and physical human frailties in particular become disagreeable and repugnant following death primes. The current research tested this hypothesis in two studies using an eye-tracking methodology. Participants were subliminally primed with death or with a control word and then viewed a series of arrays containing four pictures each, during which their eye-movements were monitored. In Study 1, the arrays included pictures of physical injury or neutral objects, and in Study 2 pictures of physical injury, threatening images, and neutral objects. The results indicated that in both studies death primes significantly decreased gaze duration towards pictures of physical injury, and did not have a significant effect on gaze duration towards neutral images. However, in Study 2 death primes increased gaze duration towards threatening images. The discussion examines the role of motivated unconscious attention in terror management processes.

Conservatism, from the Motivated Social Cognition framework, stems from epistemic and existential needs of the individual, and notably the fear of death. However, Terror Management Theory proposes a view of conservatism and its contrary, liberalism, as equivalent cultural worldviews, equally fit to fulfill such needs.

1473,Why immortality alone will not get me to the afterlife,"Recent research in the cognitive science of religion suggests that humans intuitively believe that others survive death. In response to this finding, three cognitive theories have been offered to explain this: the simulation constraint theory (Bering, 2002); the imaginative obstacle theory (Nichols, 2007); and terror management theory (Pyszczynski, Rothschild, \& Abdollahi, 2008). First, I provide a critical analysis of each of these theories. Second, I argue that these theories, while perhaps explaining why one would believe in his own personal immortality, leave an explanatory gap in that they do not explain why one would intuitively attribute survival of death to others. To fill in the gap, I offer a cognitive theory based on offline social reasoning and social embodiment which provides for the belief in an eternal social realm in which the deceased survive—the afterlife.

1474,The extremism of everyday life: Fetishism as a defense against existential uncertainty - Extremism and the psychology of uncertainty.,"In this chapter, we introduce a novel account that draws on insights from existential psychology to inform our understanding of the uncertainty-extremism relation in two ways. First, we propose that existential uncertainty—uncertainty about how, and whether it is possible, to achieve a significant life—is particularly threatening because certain belief in life's significance serves as a shield against anxiety arousing thoughts of death. Second, we propose that people may compensate for high levels of existential uncertainty by means of fetishism—investing in narrow dimensions that afford certain (albeit circumscribed and rigid) bases for affirming their life's significance. In the first section we articulate our theoretical account, showing how it builds on, but goes substantially beyond, terror management theory. Next, we review two recent lines of research that have produced findings in accord with hypotheses derived from our account. We then apply our account to analyze extremism in the real world, showing how environments that engender high levels of existential uncertainty predispose people to invest in rigid, 'fetishized' views of the social world that can foster interpersonal and intergroup conflict.

However, the terror management theory posits that group identification works to alleviate the negative effects of fear of death, therefore, the authors predicted that the sense of security and prosocial behaviors would be at relatively high levels even after the event among those who had a strong identification with the U.S. A month after the event, the authors administered a questionnaire to 98 New York citizens that included items to measure their sense of social insecurity, identification with the U.S., and prosocial behaviors. Consistent with the hypothesis, an identification with the U.S. negatively correlated with a sense of insecurity and positively correlated with prosocial behavior.

1477,A terror management analysis of self-awareness and anxiety: The hierarchy of terror,"According to terror management ({TM}) theory, self-esteem consists of accepting a cultural conception of reality and believing that one is living up to the standards of value inherent in that conception. Self-esteem buffers the anxiety that results from the awareness of human vulnerability and mortality that results from the capacity for self-awareness ({SA}). The authors argue that {SA} leads to comparisons with standards and to behavior aimed at reducing discrepancies that are detected because of the potential for existential terror, which is the emotional manifestation of the instinct for self-preservation. A hierarchical {TM} model analyzes the self-system and its relationship to other attitudes, values, and beliefs. {TM} theory posits several dynamic principles that specify how {SA} and disruptions determine the movement of conscious attention through various levels of the hierarchy.

From this perspective, artistic creation and response alleviate concerns with mortality by affording opportunities to bolster cultural belief systems that provide death-transcending meaning and significance. We review research showing that reminders of mortality exaggerate people’s responses (positive and negative) to artworks that bear on their conceptions of death, cultural ideologies and symbols, and bases of meaning. We also review research on the interplay between the motives for terror management and creative self-expression. We compare a {TMT} analysis to alternative accounts of art’s function derived from uncertainty management theory (e.g., van den Bos, 2009) and the meaning maintenance model (Heine, Proulx, \& Vohs, 2006). We conclude by recommending that future research examine whether immersive aesthetic engagement is psychologically beneficial because it provides temporary relief from the awareness of death.

1479,Terror management theory and performance: The effects of mortality salience on effort during cognitive tasks,"Two studies examined the effects of mortality salience on performance effort. Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) states that when people are confronted with ideas about their own mortality, they respond in part by attempting to bolster their self-esteem. According to {TMT}, self-esteem is a primary defense against mortality concerns, and persons under mortality salience strive to compensate by seeking information or engaging in behaviors to bolster esteem. Performance tasks provide opportunities for self-enhancement. Thus, we should be highly motivated to maximize our performance on tasks that are related to our self-esteem when mortality is made salient. In study 1, participants (n=80) were asked to write about mortality or a control topic (dental pain) and then worked on an anagram task (which included an unsolvable item) for as long as they wanted. In study 2, following the same mortality salience manipulation, participants (n=80) worked as long as they wanted on an idea generation (brainstorming) task. In support of the hypothesis, participants in both studies spent more time on task following mortality salience. The results could not be accounted for by mood differences between conditions. In study 2 participants in the mortality salience condition who thought the task was predictive of their future success expressed the highest confidence in how they would perform on the upcoming task. Consistent with {TMT}, mortality salience appears to stimulate effort on cognitive tasks. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Paratore, Daniel",1,,1478
1480,The never-ending story: A terror management perspective on the psychological function of self continuity - Self continuity: Individual and collective perspectives.,"People are typically motivated, even obsessed, with articulating and refining an integrative and self-defining life story. They write in journals, compose autobiographies, track their genealogy, struggle to make sense of painful or unresolved memories of past events, and find life purpose in a distant dream. In this chapter the authors propose, based on terror management theory ({TMT}), that narrative continuity serves to lend meaning and significance to life, obscures the arbitrary and transient nature of existence, and thereby helps the individual manage deeply rooted concerns about death. Becker's work and {TMT} posit that a temporally extended self realizes its inevitable demise and thus operates in a context of potential anxiety; however, it also creatively transforms past and future in culturally valued ways and thus operates in a symbolic context of meaning and value. This meaning, however, can take personally and socially destructive forms. The chapter ends by noting that a more satisfying mode of selfhood may be to transcend the need for a meaningful sense of self-in-time and its associated neuroses, and to foster, within the limits of what is practically feasible, a more expansive engagement with the present through intrinsically enjoyable activity. Perhaps through an hour on a pottery wheel, a stimulating conversation, or a serene hike we can find pockets of what Lifton called experiential transcendence—a feeling state so intense that we are temporarily free of time and death.

1481,"Ambivalence Toward the Body: Death, Neuroticism, and the Flight From Physical Sensation","Based on terror management theory, the authors suggest that ambivalent reactions to the human body are partially rooted in the association of the physical body with inescapable death and that individuals high in neuroticism are particularly vulnerable to such difficulties. Three experiments demonstrated that priming thoughts about one's death leads individuals high in neuroticism to flee from physical sensations, including pleasurable ones. In response to mortality salience, highly neurotic individuals spent less time submerging their arm in ice-cold water and using an electric foot massager but did not avoid stimulation in nontactile modalities (i.e., listening to music). The discussion highlights the role of existentially motivated self-repression in inhibitions surrounding the body.

1482,Psychology of terrorism: Classic and contemporary insights,"Substate terrorism now represents one of the gravest threats to human civilizations. As the frequency of interstate wars has declined since the end of the Second World War, terrible violence against innocent civilians is increasingly perpetrated by non-state groups with extreme agendas and virtually no restraints. Why do people become terrorists? Are terrorists crazy? Simply evil? Normal people driven to extremes? What social factors and tensions are most likely to provoke terrorist behaviors? And how can we use our rapidly growing understanding of the psychology of terrorism to anticipate the coming attacks and protect the international community? Psychology of Terrorism is a collection of the best classic and contemporary writings about the mind of the terrorist. Carefully selected by a panel of world-renowned authorities for value and readability, this collection provides the reader with deep knowledge and unique insights into the ideas, feelings, and social influences of modern terrorist groups. General readers who wish to understand this deadly phenomenon, students and scholars of human psychology or political science, and decision makers facing the challenge of designing effective counterterrorism policies will enjoy and profit from these essential readings and the inescapable conclusion they suggest: By ignoring the psychology of terrorism, Western nations have been making grave errors in the so-called war on terrorism. Understanding the deep roots of terrorist behaviors gives us tools that are absolutely vital to any effort in reducing this escalating threat.

1483,"Death anxiety, depression, and coping in family caregivers","Along with the growth of the aging population and of elderly patients with chronic and disabling conditions, the number of family caregivers will continue to rise. Caregiving has been associated with negative physical and psychological impact on the caregivers' health, as well as with higher prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and higher risk of mortality. Although there is substantial research on the relationship between caregiving and depression and some research on the relationship between depression and death anxiety in the general population, there remains a gap in the literature regarding possible relationships among depression, death anxiety, and coping in family caregivers. The purpose of this study was to examine if any of the demographic variables would be significant predictors of death anxiety and if death anxiety would be significant predictor of depression and coping in the sample of adult family caregivers of adult patients. Three theories served as a base for this study: the transactional theory of stress, the health belief model, and the terror management theory. Participants included a convenience sample of 46 family caregivers. Participants completed the Revised Collett-Lester Fear of Death and Dying Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Revised, the Ways of Coping Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis identified significant relationships between death anxiety, depression, coping, and duration of caregiver experience. The findings of this study could help promote positive social change by providing medical practitioners and psychologists with enhanced knowledge, facilitating development of interventions helping to deal with death anxiety, and achieving efficient coping in the family caregivers.

1485,The effect of sensation seeking and mortality salience on risk-taking behavior in scuba divers,"This research examined the effects of death reminders on the risk-taking behaviors of scuba divers. Participating divers (n=160; 101 male, 59 female) were given the Sensation Seeking Scale---form V, the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding, and a demographic questionnaire about scuba experience. The dependent variables were seven risky diving scenarios and a seven-point scale of the perceived risk for each of the scenarios. Half the divers were given a death reminder. Results indicated that, as hypothesized, those who scored high in sensation seeking were more likely to engage in risky diving behavior. Results indicated that distal reminders of death had no significant effect on risk-taking behavior as compared with controls. Divers with more experience were more likely to engage in risky diving behavior, suggesting a self-efficacy factor that may have negated any effect of the death reminder. The effects of dive experience were moderated by risk perception, particularly in the experimental condition. The results are examined in view of the ambiguous nature of proximal and distal death reminders in extreme sports. The social aspect of terror management mechanisms and how it might operate in extreme sports, as well as the practical value of considering this aspect in dive training, are discussed.

1486,The terror management function of Orthodox Jewish religiosity: A religious culture approach,"Terror management theory proposes that humans, able to envision their inevitable death, develop worldviews opposing this debilitating fear. One {TMT} implication of considerable interest is its connection with the formation of religious belief. Taking a religious culture approach, this study measured the effect of death reminders on self-reported religiosity among 131 Orthodox Jews, and examined if Baal Teshuva—'returnees' differed from individuals born into Orthodox Judaism. Results showed that death reminders had a varied effect—both Baal Teshuva and those with intra-Orthodox religious change reported higher levels of intrinsic religiosity, while those without change reported lower. Explanations for these intra-faith differences relate to attachment theory and possible 'Compensation' among those with religious change.

We compare and contrast the {TMT} perspective with system justification theory and discuss points of agreement and disagreement between these conceptualizations. We discuss the relationship between 'external' cultural ideologies and individual interpretations and how such external belief systems interact with psychological forces to create individualized cultural worldviews. We consider the impact of individual ideological changes on the collective mainstream worldview of a culture. We explore the possibility that some ideological positions may be better at providing existential comfort than others, conditions under which this is likely to be the case, as well as conservative and liberal ideological shifts. We conclude with a consideration of variables that determine which aspects of one's worldview people gravitate toward when their need for protection is aroused.

1488,Religious fundamentalism and terror management: Differences by interdependent and independent self-construal,"Two studies tested the hypothesis that religious fundamentalism and self-construal are associated with systematic differences in death awareness. We hypothesized that, for individuals low in religious fundamentalism, who presumably experience less of an anxiety buffer based on worldview, interdependent self-construal (a sense of the self as encompassing connections to close others) should be associated with reduced baseline death awareness--because relational processes may have anxiety buffering functions. Results from both studies supported this notion, showing that chronic and primed interdependence were associated with reduced death-awareness for low fundamentalists. Among persons scoring high on religious fundamentalism levels of death awareness were unrelated to self-construal. These studies suggest that fundamentalism and self-conceptions interact to influence the terror-management process.

1489,Approaching relief: Compensatory ideals relieve threat-induced anxiety by promoting approach-motivated states,"We propose that in anxious circumstances people are drawn toward idealistic meanings and purposes because ideals efficiently and reliably engage approach motivated states. We present evidence that approach motivation and anxiety are inversely related; that approach motivation and anxiety are positively and negatively associated with meaning in life, respectively; and that ideals are more reliable vehicles than concrete goals for sustaining meaning, approach motivation, and relief from anxiety. We suggest that various threats arouse anxiety because they generate goal conflict, review evidence for a reactive approach-motivation ({RAM}) interpretation of idealistic and worldview defense (Nash, {McGregor}, \& Prentice, 2011), and integrate consistency, terror management, self-affirmation, and attachment-related theories of threat and compensatory defense from a {RAM} theory perspective. We conclude with a {RAM} account for why compensatory defenses tend to be idealistically conservative, group-based, and religious, and how they can be either antisocial or prosocial.

1490,Death row nutrition Curious conclusions of last meals,"The growing macabre fascination with 'last meals' offers a window into one’s true consumption desires when one’s value of the future is discounted close to zero. But in contrast to popular anecdotes and individual case studies, we created an empirical catalog of actual last meals – the final food requests of 247 individuals executed in the United States during a recent five-year period. Our content analyses reveal three key findings: (1) the average last meal is calorically rich (2756 calories) and proportionally averages 2.5 times the daily recommended servings of protein and fat, (2) the most frequent requests are also calorie dense: meat (83.9\%), fried food (67.9\%), desserts (66.3\%), and soft drinks (60.0\%), and (3) 39.9\% requested branded foods or beverages. These findings are respectfully consistent with a model of environmentally contingent temporal discounting, and they are consistent with studies of how food is used to mediate feelings of stress and distress. Given that some people who are warned about the ill effects of obesity might counterintuitively engage in unhealthy overconsumption, the findings also suggest further study relating to the artificial use of mortality salience in campaigns against obesity.

1491,Reaction time measures of death attitudes:  Examining the correlates of death anxiety and testing terror management hypotheses,"Although most people report little concern about death, self-report measures may underestimate the extent to which people fear death because this fear may exist below the level of awareness. In three studies implicit death anxiety was assessed using the Implicit Association Test, the emotional Stroop task, and the affective Simon paradigm. Because these measures are based on reaction times rather than self-reports, one might expect them to be less biased by defensive distortions or impression management and to provide a clearer picture than more traditional questionnaires of just how much people are concerned with death. In Study 1 the relation of {IAT} and Stroop measures of implicit death anxiety to explicit death anxiety, sex, race, belief in an afterlife, self-esteem, and cultural estrangement was examined. The results of Study 1 indicate a discrepancy between self-reported death attitudes and implicit death attitudes as measured by reaction time tasks. In Study 2, emotional reactions to death, as evidenced by the Stroop color-naming and affective Simon paradigms, were compared to more subtle self-report measures such as personifying death as a character in a play and describing one's deathbed scene. Whereas both personification and reaction time measures indicated more negative death attitudes than scores on traditional questionnaires, self-reported death attitudes were only slightly related to performance on the Stroop and Simon tasks. The possibility that explicit death attitudes measured by self-report and implicit death attitudes measured by reaction time tasks might moderate defensive reactions in response to thinking about personal death was investigated in Study 3. The results failed to replicate previous findings that mortality salience results in increased longevity bias and worldview defense making the assessment of potential moderation untenable. It is argued that future research should establish the psychometric properties of implicit death attitude measures based on reaction time and should use these measures in conjunction with self-report measures to predict other death related behaviors.

1492,Death on the brain: Effects of mortality salience on the neural correlates of ingroup and outgroup categorization,"Research has shown that thoughts of one's; own death (i.e. mortality salience; {MS}) increase aspects of intergroup bias. However, the extent to which {MS} influences neural activity underlying basic person perception processes has not been examined. In the current study, event-related brain potentials were used as measures of online attentional and evaluative processes as White participants categorized ingroup (White) and outgroup (Black) faces according to expression (happy vs angry) following either {MS} or a control induction. Results showed that {MS} affected the amplitude of the P2 and N2 components elicited by ingroup faces but had no effect on the processing of outgroup faces. Processing of angry ingroup relative to angry outgroup faces was pronounced in the {MS} condition, reflected both in N2 amplitude and in longer latency of the P3 component, suggesting heightened sensitivity to threats to positive ingroup. Overall, findings suggest that {MS} intensifies perception of social category features, primarily by enhancing processing of ingroup cues.

Normal social psychological processes such as uncertainty reduction, terror management, social identity, meaning making (through religion), in combination with cognitive factors such as intratextuality and low integrative complexity, provide a more adequate understanding of die radicalization of young people, some of whom go on to commit violence against hated out-groups.

Two studies examined the possibility that dispositional self-control uniquely predicts responses to mortality salience, above and beyond self-esteem. In Study 1, an initial exercise in emotion regulation increased subsequent accessibility of death thoughts. In Study 2, mortality salience increased worldview defense. Both of these effects were moderated by dispositional self-control, such that the effects occurred among participants with low but not high self-control. More importantly, these moderating effects were observed over and above the moderating effects of self-esteem. Findings suggest that self-control may serve as an important and unique buffer against thoughts of death.

The present study evaluated whether {MS} would have a larger impact on aggression under group as opposed to individual interactions, and whether the tendency for groups to be more aggressive than individuals (i.e. interindividual-intergroup discontinuity effect) would be magnified under conditions of {MS}. Participants assigned to an individual or a three-person group condition wrote down thoughts about dental pain or mortality. Later, participants read a worldview-threatening essay from another individual or group at a rival university and subsequently allocated hot sauce for the others to consume. Results supported the primary hypotheses: those writing about death were more aggressive than those writing about dental pain; groups were more aggressive than individuals; those in the {MS} condition tended to show more aggression; and the discontinuity effect was more visible among those in the {MS} condition.

1497,The uncanny advantage of using androids in cognitive and social science research,"The development of robots that closely resemble human beings can contribute to cognitive and social science research. An android provides an experimental apparatus that has the potential to be controlled more precisely than any human actor. However, preliminary results indicate that only very humanlike devices can elicit the broad range of responses that people typically direct toward each other. Conversely, to build androids capable of emulating human behavior, it is necessary to investigate social activity in detail and to develop models of the cognitive mechanisms that support this activity. Because of the reciprocal relationship between android development and the exploration of social mechanisms, we need to establish the field of android science. Androids could be a key testing ground for social, cognitive, and neuroscientific theories as well as platform for their eventual unification. Nevertheless, subtle flaws in appearance and movement can be more apparent and more eerie in very humanlike robots. This uncanny phenomenon may be symptomatic of entities that elicit our model of a human other but do not measure up to it. If so, very humanlike robots may provide the best means of pinpointing what kinds of behavior are perceived as human, since deviations from human norms are more obvious in them than in more mechanical-looking robots. In pursuing this line of inquiry, it is essential to identify the mechanisms involved in evaluations of human likeness. One hypothesis is that, by playing on an innate fear of death, an uncanny robot elicits culturally-supported defense responses for coping with death's inevitability. An experiment, which borrows from methods used in terror management research, was performed to test this hypothesis.

1498,An examination of the promoter of gender role stereotype-activation based on terror management theory,"The purpose of this study is to examine the promoting effect of a fear of death on the activation of gender role stereotypes. Terror management theory proposes that when mortality is salient, people heighten the tendency to support their cultural worldview. Since stereotypes are considered to represent cultural worldview, a fear of death should increase the responses consistent with the stereotype, In this study, the activation of stereotypes regarding gender roles (e.g., 'Housekeeping is a job for women.') was measured with an Implicit Association Test ({IAT}). Participants were 48 male undergraduate and graduate students. The results showed that the participants who completed the questionnaire implying mortality had a larger {IAT} effect than those who completed the questionnaire unrelated to mortality, and that death-related anxiety led to the activation of gender role stereotypes. It is claimed that terror management theory has theoretical value for studies on stereotype activation, as well as a function in justifying a system such as gender role in stereotype activation.

1499,Goal shifts following reminders of mortality: Reconciling posttraumatic growth and terror management theory,"Research findings within posttraumatic growth ({PTG}) and terror management theory ({TMT}) currently appear contradictory. Following confrontations with mortality, {PTG} research demonstrates intrinsic goal shifts, whereas {TMT} suggests extrinsic shifts. The current studies examine factors contributing to these inconsistent results. Study 1 demonstrates that perceived death threat is associated with {PTG} effects. Study 2 illuminates the importance of duration of death processing. Study 3 demonstrates that existing goal values and duration and type of processing all interact in determining ultimate goal structure, with a match between level of goals and processing producing the most psychologically advantageous outcomes. Although previous research suggests that short-term confrontations with death may lead to defensiveness, the current studies suggest that encountering death over a longer period or in a manner consistent with goal structure may lead individuals to transcend defensiveness and maintain intrinsic goals or become more intrinsically oriented.

1500,Digging in Terror Management Theory: To use or lose the symbolic self?,"Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) is a well-established theory that has provided major and frequent contributions to the field of psychology and beyond. Alongside of {TMT}'s strength and breath, however, are some reasons to believe that the theory may not be complete. The theory focuses primarily on the symbolic mechanisms (cultural standards and self-esteem) that individuals use to cope with existential anxiety. In this article, I raise the possibility that individuals may also use presymbolic mechanisms to cope with this anxiety. Presymbolic mechanisms include phenomena such as flow, sex, secure attachment, and getting lost in a crowd. They operate, in large part, by reducing objective self-awareness. These mechanisms are evolutionarily and developmentally more basic than symbolic ones and do not require as great an involvement of symbolic capacities. I begin by discussing the symbolic buffer that is at the core of {TMT}. Then, I describe some presymbolic mechanisms and present some evidence that they may also be useful in buffering existential concerns. After that, I discuss some factors that may determine when individuals use presymbolic mechanisms, rather than symbolic ones, to manage their existential concerns. Finally, I offer some speculations on the nature of optimal existential regulation. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Wisman, Arnaud",0,,1498
1501,The development of social identity: What develops? - The development of the social self.,"My aim in this chapter has been to highlight some of the ideas and findings in this book that will provide a spur for debate and further research. Although I have focused on issues that are debatable, my overall sense is that the book portrays a relatively coherent and consensual view the social identity approach offers plenty of interesting research questions for developmentalists, and vice versa. At the outset of this chapter I asked whether the cognitive-motivational elements of self-categorisation and social identity should be the only, or the most important, aspect of children's group membership that should attract our interest. Are we asking the right questions about children's relationship to social groups and categories? I think future research would benefit by devoting further attention to the social (e.g., cultural, intragroup, and interpersonal) processes by which intergroup relationships are defined, sustained, and given continued meaning for children. Second, the different chapters in this book reveal a certain tension between social-contextual and cognitive-developmental accounts of social identity in children. I asked what other elements in the developmental equation may have been neglected. As Bennett and Sani note in their introduction, there are good reasons to think that social identity involves developmental processes across the lifespan as well as between situations, contexts, and intergroup relationships. Perhaps equally important is to be aware that social identity is not all in the head. It is something that must acquire shared meaning, and that necessarily involves social interaction between people and in relatively stable social environments. Rather little of the work described in this book examines directly how those interactions may be involved in the way social identity is constructed, and this could be a very productive avenue for future research. Third, there is controversy in the adult literature surrounding various assumptions made by social identity theory and self-categorisation theory. How far does developmental research reflect these controversies? There has been some progress, and a host of interesting questions invite further exploration. For example, these include the way children regulate their behaviour as group members, the developmental impact of different motivational elements such as uncertainty reduction, need for cognition, terror management, impression management, optimal distinctiveness, and self-verification, and the link between communication and social identity. To conclude, the important point to emerge from all of the fascinating work and ideas in this book is that social identity phenomena invite an analysis that goes beyond a cognitive-developmental approach and beyond a social-cognitive approach. We do need to specify the distinctive effects of cognitive development and of self-categorisation and social identification. But to predict how these will be manifested as children grow older almost certainly requires a more extensive analysis of the way culture, cultural rules and traditions, and specific group norms are maintained within groups, as well as an account of the historical context of intergroup relations. The chapters in this book reflect very substantial progress in clearing the ground theoretically and methodologically. The book as a whole provides a stimulus for many interesting and important questions for future research. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Abrams, Dominic",0,,1499
1502,The sweet escape: Effects of mortality salience on consumption quantities for high- and low-self-esteem consumers,"This research demonstrates that exposure to death-related stimuli can increase consumers' amounts of purchasing and consumption. We demonstrate that consumers who have been recently reminded of their own impending mortality wish to purchase higher quantities of food products (and actually eat higher quantities) than do their control counterparts. This effect occurs primarily among low-self-esteem consumers. We explain our findings in terms of escape from self-awareness. Low (but not high) self-esteem participants overconsume in response to a mortality salience activation as a means to escape from self-awareness. We also address alternative explanations for these effects. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","M and el, Naomi and Smeesters, Dirk",0,,1500
1503,Self-sacrifice as self-defence: Mortality salience increases efforts to affirm a symbolic immortal self at the expense of the physical self,"The increasing occurrence of suicide bombing attacks highlights a question that has received little direct empirical attention in social psychology. Why are people willing to sacrifice their lives to advance an ideological agenda? The current research suggests that willingness to self-sacrifice reflects efforts to manage death awareness by investing in a symbolic identity that provides some form of immortality. If willingness to self-sacrifice is a response to death awareness then increasing the salience of death thoughts should lead to an increase in willingness to self-sacrifice for a death transcending symbolic identity (e.g. one's nation). Further, if self-sacrifice after mortality salience ({MS}) is a striving for symbolic immortality then having participants imagine an alternative way to transcend death should moderate this effect. Support for these hypotheses was found as {MS} increased willingness of British participants to self-sacrifice for England, but only when an alternative route to symbolic immortality was not provided. Implications are briefly discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Routledge, Clay and Arndt, Jamie",0,,1501
1504,"The logic of terrorism: Existential anxiety, the search for meaning, and terrorist ideologies","Drawing from the work of political theorists, theologians, anthropologists, journalists, philosophers, and contemporary psychologists studying Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), it becomes possible to see that the concepts of existentialism and ideology may be useful for modern thinkers attempting to understand a problem such as terrorism. Integrating work from these fields makes it possible to see that terrorism may be driven by an existential-terroristic feedback loop: a cycle in which people support or engage in terrorism to alleviate existential anxiety but ultimately find this anxiety exacerbated in the wake of the violence they create or sanction. The loop is closed when this exacerbated anxiety compels them to reaffirm their support of, or participation in, terrorist violence. If this model is valid, then effectively addressing the problem of terrorism requires joining existing U.S. policies with policies that address ideologies. Specifically, policies must aspire to a) mitigate existential anxiety, b) provide a compelling counter-narrative, c) address environmental factors conducive to radicalization, d) prevent the formation of radicalized groups, and e) deradicalize existing ideologues.

1505,Like a deer in the headlights: Threat and decisions that favor the status quo,"I investigate the status quo ({SQ}) bias as a heuristic in decision-making, and the impact that threats have on heuristic use. In Study 1 participants read about scientific theories that were 30\%, 60\%, or 90\% likely to be correct, based on scientific expert judgment. P's rated how well the theory described the way things ought to work. As the probability the theory was correct increased, participants felt that it described how things ought to work-this equation of 'is' with 'ought' demonstrates the naturalistic fallacy. In Study 2, participants received positive, negative, or neutral feedback on an intelligence test, and then evaluated 2 health insurance plans (the status quo or an alternative). Participants receiving personal threat in the form of negative feedback more highly evaluated the current plan-people who did not receive a personal threat were more likely to consider alternatives, and did not value the status quo option. In Study 3, students received either no threat or a mortality salience ({MS}) threat, and then were asked to consider an alternative form of grading (changing from quizzes to papers or vice versa) in a Western Civilization course. {MS}-primed participants showed a higher evaluation of the current format of grading (regardless of whether the {SQ} was described as papers or quizzes); Control participants did not highly evaluate the {SQ}. In Study 4, {MS}- or {TV}-primed participants rated 2 statements, each containing 4 Rokeach values. One statement was characterized as long-standing American values ({SQ}), the other was characterized as newer American values. {MS} increased endorsement of the {SQ} value set and decreased endorsement for the newer value set. These studies show that status quo bias acts like a heuristic-it's used to estimate value, and its use increases under threat. Because mortality salience enhances status quo bias, the defense of one's cultural worldview ({CWV}) in terror management studies might be properly explained in terms of defense of the {SQ}. Also discussed are similarities to lay epistemic theory and contrasts with economic decision models. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Horstman Reser, April",0,,1503
1506,The social psychology of uncertainty management and system justification - Social and psychological bases of ideology and system justification.,"This chapter reviews recent research findings on the social psychology of uncertainty management processes and the role these processes have in explaining system justification and other human reactions (such as people's behavioral reactions to homeless individuals and how people respond toward messages that violate or support their religious worldviews). In doing so, it is posited that (at least sometimes) uncertainty management may better explain people's responses than an important other account, namely, terror management theory ({TMT}). The text also focuses on the social psychological processes underlying uncertainty management effects and argues that personal uncertainty has strong effects on human reactions because personal uncertainty involves affective-experiential processes and typically constitutes an alarming experience to people. Thus, I suggest that the social psychology of uncertainty management and system justification involve processes of 'hot cognition' and not 'cold cognition.' I close by discussing the implications for the psychology of system justification and people's beliefs in a just world.

1507,Supervision Groups at a Time of Violent Social Conflict in Israel,"Beginning in September 2000, terror attacks and large numbers of casualties became part of Israel's harrowing daily routine. The attacks occurred throughout the country, putting everyone at risk. These events also shattered the illusion of coexistence between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel and led to feelings of anger and suspicion between the two sectors. During this period we continued to conduct supervision groups for professionals in the helping professions, with some of these groups consisting of both Jewish and Arab participants. We expected to see the social conflict reflected in our groups, but they behaved quite differently. In light of our experience, this paper deals with the question of whether, at a time of existential threat and violent social conflict, the group can serve as a safe space for the participants and how external processes affect the level of group work and its basic assumptions.

Defenses--such as beliefs that provide permanence, predictability, and meaning--are erected whose function is in part to keep thoughts about death as far removed from consciousness as possible. The current study investigated the defensive function of Christian fundamentalist belief in managing death-awareness. The general hypothesis of the study is that challenges to such beliefs undermine one's ability to control cognitions related to mortality. More specifically, it was hypothesized that successful challenges to this form of religious belief would make death-related cognitions more accessible to consciousness. Self-identified Christians, both fundamentalists and non-fundamentalists, encountered material that challenged the fundamentalist belief that the Christian Bible is free of inconsistencies and contradictions. Consistent with expectations, under these conditions higher levels of accessibility of death-related cognition were found among fundamentalist Christians, but not their non-fundamentalist counterparts.

1509,"Effects of cultural worldview belief and the achievement of cultural standards of value on self-esteem, anxiety and adaptive behavior of Native Hawaiian students","The purpose of this study was to examine the psychological framework called the Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) applied to Native Hawaiian students. {TMT} is a framework that provides an explanation of relationships between cultural factors, self-esteem, and anxiety (Solomon, Greenberg, \& Pyszczynski, 1991). The hypotheses of this study was that Native Hawaiian students who identify or seek to identify with 'being Hawaiian' and are assisted in achieving its standards of value (high cultural values) will (1) have higher levels of self esteem if they see themselves achieving cultural standards following treatment; (2) have lower levels of anxiety following treatment; (3) increase 'adaptive' behaviors such as achieving academic standards, positive social interactions and making positive contributions to their families and communities. The design of this study was both quantitative and qualitative. The design of this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison-group design, consisting of two intervention groups and two comparison groups of 24 Native Hawaiian students from ages 9-16 years. Intervention participants engaged in Native Hawaiian cultural interventions for 10 hours over a six-week period, while comparison participants engaged in academic tutorial sessions. Measures for self-esteem, anxiety, and adaptive behavior were taken before and after intervention. Qualitative and anecdotal data were also collected and analyzed. Intervention group results indicated that Hawaiian identity increased, anxiety decreased and positive behavior increased. Findings were mixed for self-esteem. Qualitative measures indicated increase in self-esteem, participants felt 'good' about themselves and were 'proud,' but quantitative indicated a decrease. Comparison group indicated a decrease in Hawaiian identity, anxiety and self-esteem. Overall, there were positive indicators to conclude that the {TMT} framework is applicable to the Native Hawaiian population.

1510,Does Threatening Valued Components of Cultural Worldview Alter Explicit and Implicit Attitudes About Death?,"The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis derived from Terror Management Theory, that cultural worldview acts as a buffer against death anxiety. University students (N = 76) were randomly assigned to read either an essay that described marriage as an antiquated and untenable social institution, an essay that described America's status as world superpower as transitory, or a no threat control essay about the difference between an encyclopedia and a dictionary. Next, all participants completed the revised Death Anxiety Questionnaire and a version of the Implicit Association Test that measured the degree to which they associated death more with self or other people. Worldview threat did not affect participants' explicit death anxiety but participants in the marriage threat condition did show greater implicit death concern than those in the control condition.

Participants (N = 410) who were exposed to a subtle reminder of 9/11 perceived more social consensus for their belief than those who were exposed to an overt one. Consistent with {TMT}, the pattern was especially strong for participants with the minority belief. The effect abated once the anniversary ended.

1512,Fighting death with death: The buffering effects of learning that worldview violators have died,"According to terror management theory, the annihilation of people who threaten one's worldview should serve the function of defending that worldview. The present research assessed this hypothesis. A sample of Christian participants read either a worldview-threatening news article reporting on the Muslimization of Nazareth or a non-threatening article about the aurora borealis. Half of the participants in the worldview-threat condition were informed at the end of the article that a number of Muslims had died in a plane crash on their way to Nazareth. Although reading the threatening news article increased death-thought accessibility and worldview defense relative to reading the neutral article, these increases were not observed among participants who learned that a number of Muslims were dead.

In Study 1, when concerns about mortality were primed, reminders of human beings' physical nature (i.e., creatureliness) reduced intentions to conduct {BSEs} compared to reminders of humans' uniqueness. In Study 2, women conducted shorter exams on a breast model (an experience found to increase death-thought accessibility) when creatureliness was primed compared to a uniqueness and no essay condition. In Study 3, after a creatureliness prime, women performed shorter {BSEs} when a placebo did not provide an alternative explanation for their discomfort compared to when it did.

1514,The Cultural Animal: Twenty Years of Terror Management Theory and Research - Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology.,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) proposes that the uniquely human awareness of mortality is a ubiquitous concern that plays an important role in virtually all forms of human behavior and underlies the development and maintenance of culture and self-esteem as the primary means by which the fear of death is ameliorated. Although existential psychodynamic accounts of human behavior have historically been repudiated by academic psychologists on the grounds that they cannot be empirically tested, {TMT} stands in stark contradistinction to this claim. A substantial body of empirical evidence now supports the basic tenets of {TMT}. {TMT} has attracted the interest and engaged the efforts of scholars in a variety of disciplines throughout the world and has generated research on a range of topics far beyond the original scope of the theory. We are gratified by the cumulative progress to date and excited about the provocative prospects ahead, as exploration of the psychological consequences of the uniquely human dilemma continues.

1516,The uncertainty-threat model of political conservatism - Extremism and the psychology of uncertainty.,"Several social psychological theories assume that uncertainty and threat promote all forms of ideological zeal regardless of specific belief contents. For instance, Greenberg and Jonas suggested that 'if an individual has particularly strong needs to reduce fear and uncertainty, she or he would most likely grab on tightly to the prevailing ideology—whether oriented toward the right or the left'. In this chapter, we review the basic tenets of the uncertainty-threat model as well as several limitations and criticisms of previous research used to support it. We emphasize recent evidence, especially the results of three studies that compare the uncertainty-threat model of political conservatism to alternative models positing that heightened needs to reduce uncertainty and threat should be associated with ideological extremity rather than conservatism per se. We find that the preponderance of the evidence favors the uncertainty-threat model over alternative conceptions of ideology, including terror management theory, uncertainty-identity theory, and the compensatory conviction model.

1517,"Meaning, mortality, and choice: The social psychology of existential concerns","A fundamental aspect of being human is knowing that one day we will die. Efforts to contend with this knowledge are at the root of a great many social behaviors across a variety of domains, and include efforts to transcend the human body, aggression against enemies and the need for scapegoats, even extreme reactions such as terrorism and suicide, as well as the development of symbolic language and the creation of art and music. In this thought-provoking addition to the Herzliya Series on Personality and Social Psychology, editors Phillip R. Shaver and Mario Mikulincer have gathered a varied group of international thinkers to investigate these existential concerns within a framework that is both philosophical and practical. Theorists examine the nature of universal themes such as the importance of personal choice and human autonomy in an arbitrary world, and the vital roles of parenthood and religion in providing solace against the threat of meaninglessness. And clinicians discuss the use of various cognitive–behavioral therapies, emphasizing the mind's propensity to assign value in ways that can be either maladaptive or liberating. The authors build upon insights from previous chapters, resulting in a cohesive and thoughtfully-prepared book filled with cutting-edge research.

1519,Searching for the terror in terror management: Mortality salience and physiological indices of arousal and affect,"Previous research has found that reminders of one's mortality provoke hostile reactions to those who threaten one's worldview, but such reminders have not been found to create conscious negative affect. Two studies were conducted to investigate the role of subtle affective reactions to different mortality primes as indexed by physiological measures. In Study 1, participants responded to an open-ended mortality or control treatment while skin conductance and pulse rate were recorded, and then evaluated worldview impinging essays. In Study 2, participants were exposed to masked presentations of either 'death' or 'pain,' and then to a worldview threatening essay. Facial {EMG} was recorded throughout. Results of both studies found the expected increase in worldview defense following mortality primes. Whereas Study I found an increase in arousal that was not specific to mortality salience, Study 2 found greater corrugator {EMG} specifically during exposure to the death primes. Across both studies, there was no evidence for a mediating role of affect on worldview defense following exposure to death primes. Possible explanations and future research directions are briefly discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Arndt, Jamie Lorenson",0,,1517

The theory indicates a process that occurs in different phases of criminality, involving an escalation of criminal activity, thinking, and emotions that run beyond self-control, sometimes contrary to initial decision. Its phenomenology indicates an interaction between individual, group, and situation and a growing self-centeredness with two leading motives: 'I can' and 'I must.' The first denotes a perceived legitimacy and capability to perform criminal conduct. The second reflects an existential threat and a belief that it must be removed by any action. These motives may operate in an acute or a chronic phase, within individuals, groups, or societies. The spin is a detectable process with known characteristics and prognosis.

1522,"Managing the unmanageable: Terror Management Theory, religion and sexism","The present study explores the relationships between Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), ambivalent sexism, and religious fundamentalism. {TMT} research has demonstrated that making participants' mortality salient increases secular worldview defense. {TMT} research has also demonstrated that people high in fundamentalism slum less secular worldview defense than participants lower in fundamentalism, presumably because their cognitively rigid beliefs help them to successfully manage the anxiety of death. This study examines whether amhivalent sexism functioned as a worldview defense in a highly religious population. In order to test this, data were collected from undergraduate students at a private, evangelical liberal arts university in the Southwestern United States. Participants were predominantly 18 to 20 years old and were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition. Following the experimental manipulation, all participants completed the following measures: Worldview Defense, The Christian Orthodoxy Scale. The Revised Religious Fundamentalism Scale, The Religious Orientation Scale, and The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. Results indicate that ambivalent sexism did not differ significantly between experimental and control conditions. Additionally, participants' scores on The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory were not related to scores on religious fundamentalism. Interestingly, two relationships between study variables emerged differentially across genders. The correlation between Christian Orthodoxy and Religious Fundamentalism was significantly stronger for males than for females. Additionally, the correlation between Worldview Defense and Christian Orthodoxy was also significantly stronger for males than for females.

1523,Whistling in the dark: Exaggerated consensus estimates in response to incidental reminders of mortality,"Terror management theory posits that cultural worldviews function to provide protection against anxiety concerning human vulnerability and mortality and that their effectiveness as buffers against such anxiety is maintained through a process of consensual validation. Two field experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that incidental reminders of one's mortality increase the need to believe that others share one's worldview. In both studies, 13–80 yr-olds passing by on city streets were asked to estimate the extent of social consensus for culturally relevant attitudes, 100 m before passing a funeral home, 100 m after passing a funeral home, or directly in front of a funeral home. In the first study, conducted in Germany, Ss were asked to estimate the percentage of Germans who shared their opinions about a proposal to change the German constitution to restrict the immigration of foreigners; in the second study, conducted in the {US}, Ss were asked to estimate the percentage of Americans who shared their opinions about the teaching of Christian values in the public schools.

In Study 1, the cultural anxiety-buffer was threatened through a mortality salience manipulation. Consistent with expectations, mortality salience increased interest self-protection. In Study 2, the simultaneous impact of two threats (mortality salience and level of self-esteem) was examined. Both threats moderated esteem orientations in a manner generally consistent with expectations, although the combination of high mortality salience and high self-esteem led to a surprisingly high level of interest in self-protection.

1525,Ageism and Death: Effects of Mortality Salience and Perceived Similarity to Elders on Reactions to Elderly People,"The present research investigated the hypotheses that elderly people can be reminders of our mortality and that concerns about our own mortality can therefore instigate ageism. In Study 1, college-age participants who saw photos of two elderly people subsequently showed more death accessibility than participants who saw photos of only younger people. In Study 2, making mortality salient for participants increased distancing from the average elderly person and decreased perceptions that the average elderly person possesses favorable attitudes. Mortality salience did not affect ratings of teenagers. In Study 3, these mortality salience effects were moderated by prior reported similarity to elderly people. Distancing from, and derogation of, elderly people after mortality salience occurred only in participants who, weeks before the study, rated their personalities as relatively similar to the average elderly person's. Discussion addresses distinguishing ageism from other forms of prejudice, as well as possibilities for reducing ageism.

1526,Anxiety and Intergroup Bias: Terror Management or Coalitional Psychology?,"Contemplation of death increases support of ingroup ideologies, a result explained by proponents of terror management theory ({TMT}) as an attempt to buffer existential anxiety. While {TMT} claims that only death-salient stimuli yield such effects, an evolutionary perspective suggests that increased intergroup bias may occur in response to a wide variety of situations that, in ancestral environments, posed adaptive problems for which marshaling social support was a reliably adaptive response. Four experiments from two cultures produced results consistent with this latter perspective but contrary to {TMT}. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that, among {UCLA} undergraduates, participants asked to contemplate aversive scenarios unrelated to death displayed increased support of ingroup ideology. Studies 3 and 4 replicated elements of these results, exploring the moderating effects of self-esteem and collectivism on intergroup bias in two Costa Rican samples. These results indicate that worldview defense effects occur even when death is not salient. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Navarrete, C.

1527,Self‐esteem: A human solution to the problem of death,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) posits that the need for self‐esteem develops out of the socialization process in which children learn to abide by parental and, eventually, societal standards of ‘goodness’ to feel securely embedded in a cultural belief system. According to {TMT}, feeling safely immersed in a meaningful conception of reality (i.e., the cultural worldview) ultimately functions to protect people from anxiety due to the uniquely human capacity to be cognizant of their eventual death. After presenting the basic tenets of this perspective, we review several lines of research supporting it and then address some common questions and criticisms of the theory such as how is a {TMT} view of anxiety consistent with evolutionary principles, why do people commit suicide, and how is self‐esteem pursued in non‐Western, self‐effacing cultures? Finally, we discuss some implications of {TMT} for understanding social problems and for pursuing meaning and self‐esteem in healthier, more socially productive ways.

Participants were 123 Black and 265 White elders (aged 60-100 yrs); they were assessed on the Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale ({MFODS}), self-esteem, religiosity, locus of control, socioeconomic status, social support, and health. Regression analysis findings offered partial support to the theory, with greater Fear of the Unknown (fear of annihilation) related to weaker religiosity, less social support, and greater externality; the effect of self esteem was mediated by externality. Other predictors were related to an overall fear score based on the remaining 7 {MFODS} subscales. Findings are interpreted in terms of changing sources of self-esteem in old age.

1531,"Experimental tests of terror management and psychological responses to tv news of immigrant criminals: Implications for hostility, risk vulnerability, and issue judgment","The purpose of this study was to explore social and psychological effects of mortality salience in {TV} news and social group difference between news viewers and news protagonists. Using terror management theory and social identity theory as theoretical frameworks, the study assumed that news viewers would be significantly influenced by mortality primes in {TV} news as well as the social group to which the criminals belonged in {TV} news. The assumptions in this study were investigated by two experiments: One designed to examine the social influences of {TV} news on news viewers' mortality thought, hostility toward the criminals, risk vulnerability and judgment of the immigration issue, and the other one devised to explore viewer's moment-to-moment responses, namely emotional responses, news evaluations, and crime perceptions. Experiment 1 demonstrated that mortality primes in {TV} news activated (1) viewers' mortality thoughts, (2) increasingly hostile attitudes toward the criminals, and (3) more negative judgments on the immigration issue. There is evidence that terror management theory can be used to clarify the social influences of mortality salience on viewers. Additionally, Experiment 1 found the social influences of social group difference on viewers' judgment of the immigration issue, but not on their hostility and risk vulnerability. That is, viewers may hold negative attitudes toward the immigration issue because out-group criminals in the coverage were shaped as a negative prime in viewers, which activated viewers' negative perspectives on the immigration issue. Experiment 2 indicated that (1) mortality primes in {TV} news significantly led viewers to more negative emotional responses, more newsworthy evaluations of news stories, and more severe perceptions of the criminal acts in the coverage, (2) the coverage of in-group criminals significantly activated viewers to more severe perceptions of the criminal acts than that of out-group criminals, (3) the interactions between mortality salience and social group difference significantly affected viewers' emotional responses, news evaluations, and crime perceptions, and (4) the interactions between self-esteem and mortality primes partially generated influences on viewers' emotional responses. Therefore, mortality effects in {TV} news were more powerful than social group difference effects. News viewers may purposely process some news information closely related to themselves, but not react to the stories based upon the social group of the protagonists in {TV} news.

1533,Implicit cognition and terror management theory: The utility of indirect measurement in understanding death-related defense mechanisms,"The current paper was an attempt to study the defense mechanisms of terror management theory ({TMT}) via implicit cognition/indirect measures. In Study 1, an American and Foreign Single-Category Implicit Association Test ({SC}-{IAT}) and an American-Foreign Implicit Association Test ({IAT}) were used to assess implicit attitudes toward patriotism in an attempt to predict the worldview defense of patriotism in the {TMT} paradigm. It was hypothesized that these indirect measures would be predictive of the occurrence and strength of the worldview defense among participants primed with thoughts of mortality and not control participants. The cultural worldview defense commonly found in {TMT} did not arise, which precluded testing the efficacy of indirect measures as predictors. Explanations as to why the worldview defense did not arise and modifications to the design of the study are proffered. In Study 2, the automaticity of the self-esteem bolstering construct postulated by {TMT} was examined via an indirect measure of self-esteem (i.e., the self-esteem {SC}-{IAT}) and a measure of state self-esteem (i.e., the modified Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). It was hypothesized that these measures of self-esteem would capture automatic self-esteem bolstering among participants primed with thoughts of mortality and not control participants. Both measures of self-esteem failed to capture the automaticity of the appearance of self-esteem bolstering following a mortality salience manipulation. Explanations for the lack of detection of self-esteem bolstering and suggestions for future research into the self-esteem bolstering construct within the {TMT} paradigm are discussed. Finally, factors central to the successful incorporation of indirect measures into the {TMT} paradigm are addressed.

In the current paper we argue that underlying these tangible issues are deep-seated existential concerns which fuel the conflict and stand in the way of reconciliation. We focus specifically on the unique mindset of Israeli Jews because we believe that the history of persecution against the Jews plays a vital role in how contemporary Israelis perceive the conflict. We demonstrate, on the basis of terror management theory, that reminders of personal death or collective death (the Holocaust! lead Israelis to support violent solutions, express opposition to compromise and reconciliation, and license morally questionable behavior during conflict. However, we also show that providing existential security may buffer against, and even overturn the detrimental effect of existential insecurities on violent responses. We conclude that existential security for Israelis is a precondition to peace.

1535,Traces of terror: Subliminal death primes and facial electromyographic indices of affect,"Previous research has found that both explicit and implicit reminders of one's mortality provoke hostile reactions to those who threaten one's worldview, but do not create conscious negative affect or electrodermal arousal. This study was conducted to investigate subtle affective reactions to subliminal death primes as indexed by measures of facial electromyography ({EMG}). Fifty-four participants were exposed to masked presentations of either the word 'dead' or 'pain,' and then to a worldview threatening essay. Facial {EMG} was recorded throughout. Analyses found the expected increase in worldview defense following mortality primes. Analyses also uncovered a novel finding with greater corrugator {EMG} specifically during exposure to the subliminal death but not subliminal pain primes, pointing to the sensitivity of facial {EMG} to unconscious cognition.

1536,Subliminal exposure to death-related stimuli increases defense of the cultural worldview,"Three experiments reported here provide empirical support for the hypothesis derived from terror management theory that unconscious concerns about death motivate allegiance to cultural beliefs. Study 1 (n = 58) contrasted exposure to a subliminal death-related stimulus, a standard mortality-salience treatment, and a neutral subliminal stimulus, and found that both the subliminal and the standard reminder of mortality led to more favorable evaluations of people who praised Ss' cultural worldview and more unfavorable evaluations of those who challenged it. Study 2 (n = 51) replicated this finding by comparing the effects of exposure to subliminal death stimuli and subliminal pain stimuli on Ss' evaluations of people who bolster and threaten the cultural world view. Study 3 (n = 34) contrasted subliminal death stimuli, supraliminal death stimuli, and subliminal pain stimuli and found that only subliminal death stimuli produced increased defense of the cultural worldview.

1538,Mild Epicureanism: Notes toward the definition of a therapeutic attitude,"Psychotherapists generally feel uncomfortable addressing patients' beliefs, particularly religious beliefs, because of the desire to respect client subjectivity and to avoid the abuse of therapeutic authority. This paper's first contention is that at some junctures, investigation of the client's belief structure can be an important catalyst for change, as exemplified by an extended case example. This stance assumes that much of the individual and collective damage rigid belief systems inflict derives from their function as a defense against death awareness, as described by terror management theory. The paper develops the concept of a therapeutic meta-attitude towards belief, mild Epicureanism, related to the classical Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 {BC}). Mild Epicureanism means to soften attachments to all belief systems, even therapeutic theories, to lower their potential inhibition of personal growth. The paper presents the argument that mild Epicureanism is consistent with most therapeutic approaches, and allows addressing clients' belief without interfering with their right to make up their own minds.

1539,"Meaning making, uncertainty reduction, and autobiographical memory: A replication and reinterpretation of the {TALE} Questionnaire","The present research was guided by two primary goals: 1) replicate the empirical structure of the Thinking about Life Experiences ({TALE}) questionnaire (Bluck, Alea, Habermas, \& Rubin, 2005); and 2) explore how the functions of autobiographical memory may interact and support one another. Toward the second goal, it is suggested that the potential functions of autobiographical memory may be understood from an existential framework that is grounded by two principles: humans are driven by a need for meaning and meaning is found in relation to others and other things in the world. In this pursuit of meaning making, and a desire to know what to expect from the world, humans seek to create a coherent set of relations among the various existential elements in their lives (Heine, Proulx, \& Vohs, 2006); accordingly, humans strive to reduce uncertainty about the world and their place in it. As such, the {TALE} was reinterpreted using a relational framework and a 28-item self-report measure was developed. Participants completed the {TALE} and the reinterpreted {TALE} ({RTALE}). The results provide some support for the 3-factor structure of the {TALE}. The proposed 4-factor structure of the {RTALE} was supported.

1540,Why do people join groups? Three motivational accounts from social psychology,"This paper describes and contrasts three contemporary social psychological theories that focus on why people join and identify with groups: the sociometer model, terror management theory, and uncertainty–identity theory. The sociometer model argues that people have a need to be socially included, and that self‐esteem is a meter of successful inclusion and group belonging. Terror management theory argues that people are motivated to reduce fear of the inevitability of their own death, and that the consensual belief–confirmation provided by groups drives people to belong. Uncertainty–identity theory argues that people have a basic need to reduce uncertainty about themselves, their attributes, and their place in the world, and that cognitive processes associated with group identification reduce such uncertainty. We critically contrast these three accounts to conclude that all three motivational processes may play a role, but that self‐uncertainty may have the benefit of wide generality to all groups and group contexts and of detailed specification of cognitive processes.

1541,"In case of death, cling to the ingroup","An experiment investigated whether the enhanced importance of the ingroup as a consequence of the salience of death thoughts is a unconscious defense mechanism. Scottish participants were subliminally primed with either the word death or field. Subsequently, they were asked to classify a series of pictures as either English or Scottish, and to state whether a series of negative traits applied to the English or not. Results showed that participants primed with the word death were more likely to exclude targets that looked more like outgroup than ingroup members, than participants in the field (control) prime condition. The pattern observed on the categorization-latency also supported the claim that death-prime participants are more careful in classifying targets. Finally, death-prime participants also conveyed more negative, stereotypical judgments of the English in a trait attribution task. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to terror management theory and social identification phenomena.

1542,Fleeing the body: A terror management perspective on the problem of human corporeality,"Presents a theoretical perspective on the problem of the human body rooted in terror management theory ({TMT}; Greenberg et al, 1986). From the perspective of {TMT}, the human body is problematic because it serves as a perpetual reminder of the inevitability of death. Human beings confront this problem through the development of cultural world views that imbue reality—and the body as part of that reality—with abstract symbolic meaning. This fanciful flight from death is in turn the psychological impetus for distancing from other animals and the need to regulate behaviors that remind us of our physical nature. This analysis is applied to questions concerning why people are embarrassed and disgusted by their bodies' functions; why sex is such a common source of problems, difficulties, regulations, and ritualizations; why sex tends to be associated with romantic love; and why cultures value physical attractiveness and objectify women. This article then briefly considers implications of this analysis for understanding psychological problems related to the physical body and cultural variations in the need to separate oneself from the natural world.

1544,"Political conservatism, authoritarianism, and societal threat: Voting for Republican representatives in {US} congressional elections from 1946 to 1992","The author found that the degree of national societal threat preceding congressional elections from 1946 to 1992 was positively associated with the mean state percentage of people voting for Republican representatives, supporting a conventional threat-authoritarianism hypothesis. However, threat was positively associated with the mean state percentage of people voting for Republican representatives in conservative states but not in liberal states, and the conventional threat-authoritarianism link was entirely driven by the relation in conservative states. The author classified states with a composite measure (α = .92) on the basis of state ideological identification, religious fundamentalism, composite policy liberalism, Republican Party elite ideology, and Democratic Party elite ideology. These results offer support to an interactive threat-authoritarianism hypothesis derived from the authoritarian dynamic theory of K. Stenner (2005), which postulates that only authoritarian persons are activated to manifest authoritarian behavior in times of normative threat. Also, the author discusses potential alternative explanations on the basis of system justification, need for closure, and terror-management theories.

1545,An identity consolidation view of social phenomena: Theory and research,"This thesis provides a theoretical rationale and empirical support for identity consolidation theory. The main contention of identity consolidation theory is that a powerful motivator, that drives a diverse array of enigmatic social phenomena, is the need for individuals to quell the intrapsychic conflict that arises from the unique human predicament of choice. Choice can be problematic for humans because the capacity for abstract, future oriented thought creates the potential for primary conflict among the imagined action alternatives, and secondary conflict among the priorities, values, and 'possible selves' that individuals use as arbiters for choosing among the action alternatives. As such, the adaptive advantage of planned action comes at the price of potentially paralyzing psychic conflict (Lewin, 1935) and dissonance (Festinger, 1957). According to identity consolidation theory, some of the most passionate and often irrational social behaviors derive their incentive value from their ability to quell the potential for psychic conflict inherent in the human condition. Religions, relationships, and success strivings, for example, each can be seen as providing multifaceted solutions to the fundamental predicament of choice. The dissonance-reduction mechanisms by which these, and other phenomena, contribute to eight identity consolidation strategies are explicated. As well as providing an overarching explanatory theory for understanding social phenomena, identity consolidation theory also holds promise for integrating a number of prominent social psychological theories, from a perspective that is rooted in Festinger's seminal theory of cognitive dissonance. In five experiments, dissonance was induced via three identity confrontation manipulations that expose self-relevant inconsistencies-temporal extension, mortality salience, and dilemma deliberation. In Experiment 1, the temporal extension manipulation of identity confrontation caused dissonance and more punitive reactions toward a social-deviant/outgroup member. In Experiment 2, the temporal extension and mortality salience identity confrontation manipulations caused dissonance and intergroup bias. Experiment 3 shows that the results of the first two experiments can not be accounted for by terror management theory (Greenberg, Solomon, \& Pyszczynski, 1997) because the temporal extension manipulation did not prime death thoughts. In Experiment 4, the dilemma deliberation identity confrontation manipulation caused dissonance and hardening of attitudes about social issues (i.e., more conviction, more perceived social consensus, and less ambivalence). In Experiment 5, temporal extension and mortality salience identity confrontation manipulations caused changes in the personal goals that participants intended on pursuing over the next few weeks, and the way they framed their identities.

The chapter includes five sections, each of which includes various subsections: The first section discusses three major themes in our field's approach to research: (a) the normative power of the group, (b) the centrality of subjective meaning or interpretation, and (c) an emphasis on impactful, and often non-obvious, experimental demonstrations. The second section examines some historical 'dialectics' in the evolution of particular topics and methods in social psychology. It focuses on influences from psychology in general, from social psychology in particular, and from real-world events and trends in U.S. society at large that have created opportunities and challenges, and on occasion crises, for our field. The third section discusses four foundational insights or 'pillars' that constitute cumulative lessons and continue to guide contemporary analysis, research, and application: (a) 'naïve realism' (i.e., the assumption of an isomorphism between what one 'sees' through the prism of one's expectations, needs, and knowledge structures and objective reality) and its social implications and manifestations; (b) the importance of lay dispositionism (i.e., the general failure to appreciate the power of situational forces and constraints in controlling social behavior); (c) the motivation or need to see oneself as consistent, rational, and moral; and (d) the impact of expectations and beliefs that bias perceptions, interpretations, and reactions, and in so doing create 'self-fulfilling prophesies.' The fourth section reviews promising new topics and new approaches to topics of continuing interest, including stereotyping and prejudice, cultural psychology, limitations of standard economic models of decision making, evolutionary psychology, implicit influences on belief and behavior, terror management theory, positive psychology, self-regulation, hedonic adaptation, close relationships, 'virtual' interaction, and social cognitive neuroscience. The final section discusses examples of successful applications of social psychology to real-world problems and offers some thoughts on the difficulties and challenges faced by applied researchers, especially in 'scaling up' small or mid-sized interventions.

After a brief historical and geographical survey of fantasies of flight and review of literatures establishing that all human culture and religion consists of beliefs that include at least one significant violation of natural laws, we present research in support of the general proposition that reminders of fatality increase belief in the supernatural. We follow this with our own research demonstrating that flying fantasies are intensified by intimations of mortality and that imagining oneself in flight mitigates defensive reactions to mortality salience and may have therapeutic significance.

1552,The Skull Beneath the Skin: Cancer Survival and Awareness of Death,"Terror management theory predicts that people made aware of their own mortality (mortality salience) will seek to boost their self-esteem in order to buffer the anxiety they feel. One common resource to achieve this is strengthening social bonds with an admired in-group. It would also seem to predict that cancer survivors and those close to them would be driven to a greater closeness. A similar closeness might be predicted between those with terminal illness and their families and other supporters. Some empirical observations suggest that there are other forms of death-related salience which do not conform to the predictions of terror management theory. We suggest that some of those who have recovered from cancer may be made death salient, while those close to them remain mortality salient. Death salience seems to turn people inward to the resources and challenges of their deep (subconscious and unconscious) minds, and confronts them with the realities of their deep identities. A third form of salience, dying salience, affects those who have terminal illness. Distinguishing between death salience and mortality salience provides one explanation for the frequency with which close relationships break down after recovery from cancer...

1553,"Psychological Issues in Understanding Terrorism and the Response to Terrorism - Psychology of terrorism: Coping with the continuing threat., Condensed ed.","This chapter begins with a brief effort to put modern terrorism in context. Thereafter, the chapter is divided into two main sections. The first section deals with psychological issues involved in understanding the perpetrators of terrorism, including their motivations and strategies. The second section deals with the U.S. response to terrorism, including issues of fear and identity shift in reaction to the events of September 11, 2001. Group dynamics theory is the perspective brought to bear in understanding the power of cause and comrades in moving normal people to terrorism. In particular the author suggests that the power of a group to elicit sacrifice depends upon its terror-management value, which is another way of talking about the social reality value of the group. Group dynamics research and the psychology of cohesion also provide a useful starting point for theorizing about the origins and consequences of group identification, including many aspects of public reaction to terrorism. Terrorism is a threat to all who identify with the group targeted, and at least the initial result of an attack is always increased identification--increased cohesion--in the group attacked. The non-obvious quality of this idea is conveyed by the many unsuccessful attempts to use air power to demoralize an enemy by bombing its civilian population.

1555,"Challenge, threat and pro-normative bias: Coalitional psychology in two societies","The central thesis of this dissertation is that adherence to ideologies is, at least in part, a product of pan-human psychological mechanisms for the facilitation and coordination of coalitions. This theory of coalitional psychology predicts that when faced with adaptive challenges that can be effectively addressed with the social support that coalitions can provide, individuals will exhibit increases in the pro-normative mental representations that undergird the formation and maintenance of social relationships. This theory stands in stark contrast with a current neo-Freudian approach (i.e. terror management theory) that claims that only existential concerns can cause such cognitive changes. Experiments conducted in two societies produced results consistent with this perspective. Studies described in Section I (Studies 1-4) demonstrated that urban American and rural Costa Rican participants induced to contemplate aversive scenarios unrelated to death displayed increased ingroup bias. A manipulation check demonstrated that these effects were not due to an increase in death-related thoughts. In addition to the moderating effects of individual differences in attitudinal orientation (authoritarianism, self-esteem and socio-centrism) on pro-normative bias, within each population, marked cultural differences were found between the American and Costa Rican samples in the personality variables measured. More importantly, in contrast to the U.S. results, rural Costa Rican nationals who contemplated death did not show an increase in pro-normative bias, whereas those who contemplated social isolation did show a marked increase. This research was extended (Section 2) to both investigate socio-centrism in an American sample and explore the possibility that negatively-valenced primes are not necessary to increase intergroup bias so long as the stimuli concern situations in which social support is potentially advantageous. Elements of these findings were replicated in a Costa Rican sample. However, contemplation of death again failed to increase intergroup bias. Section 3 assesses data presented here and in the {TMT} literature in light of the competing theories at issue. Additional evidence in favor of the coalitional psychology account is presented in Section 4, where the results of several pilot studies in Costa Rica and the U.S. are described. Relevant ethnographic details of rural Costa Rica are briefly discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Navarrete, Carlos David",1,,1552
1556,Meta-analysis of the psychological impact of terrorist threats on violence in the American workplace,"The purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of the psychological impact of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (9/11) and the continuing terrorist threats of violence on the American workplace. Two sets of analysis were developed from a multi methodological strategy using a survey and a meta-analysis of dissertations focused on leadership, the Terror Management Theory ({TMT}), and workplace violence. The results identified important implications for psychologists who may have to address the psychological impact of these terrorist threats. The findings from the meta-analysis indicated that the post 9/11 crisis management and effective organizational leadership factors were important in reducing the psychological impact of the attacks on the American workplace. The results supported the {TMT} by indicating that social motivation and affiliations are distinct anxiety buffers reducing mortality salience. Furthermore, the results also showed there is a need to modify current workplace violence training to include a worldviews awareness component. A survey of 120 {APA} psychologists supported a cautious approach to labeling the stress from continued threats of terrorist violence on the American workplace as being generally symptomatic of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ({PTSD}). The findings indicated both positive coping strategies and negative psychological factors for stress are present in the American workplace.

Participants were 396 undergraduates, 192 of whom met inclusion requirements. {RF} was significantly related to prejudice toward women, toward homosexual individuals, and toward other religions, the latter relationship being strongest.

This paper presents three studies investigating the relevance of a new social psychological construct, namely 'perceived collective continuity' ({PCC}), and its relationship with group identification and social well-being. Study one shows that perceived collective continuity is positively associated with perceived group entitativity and several social identity related measures, such as collective self-esteem and ingroup identification. Study two reveals that perceived collective continuity has positive effects on social well-being and social integration, and that perceived group entitativity and collective self-esteem mediate these effects. In study three we show that mortality salience priming leads to an increase of the perception of group temporal endurance which, in turn, contributes to an increase of ingroup identification. On the whole, these three studies confirm that 'perceived collective continuity' is a relevant theoretical construct, which has important implications for social well-being.

The body threatens the efficacy of such mechanisms by reminding us that we are animals nonetheless, and therefore fated to death. I present research demonstrating that existential concerns contribute to uneasiness with the body, especially regarding sex, and also to pervasive concerns with how the body measures up to cultural standards, most obviously regarding women's appearance.

1562,Terror management by proxy:  Can romantic partners alleviate anxieties about death?,"Three experiments examined the intersection between terror management and romantic relationship processes. Each experiment provided a different test of the hypothesis that romantic partners can serve as a death-anxiety buffer for people who see their romantic relationships as an important source of self-esteem. In Experiment 1, people whose relationships varied in importance to their self-esteem were randomly assigned to a mortality salient or a control condition. As predicted, when mortality was salient, people whose relationships were more important to their self-esteem utilized their partners for self- and cultural validation. The self-validation effect was partially replicated in Experiment 2. Experiment 2 also measured death-thought accessibility in people whose relationships varied in importance to their self-esteem. Participants were primed with death or a control topic and with a photo of their romantic partner or a control photo. Contrary to predictions, death thoughts were exacerbated by the partner photo in the mortality salient condition for participants whose partners were less important to their self-esteem. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that people whose relationships were more important to their self-esteem would show less worldview defense (i.e., less preference for a hero over a transgressor) when their romantic partners were primed. Although priming of the partner led to a decrease in worldview defense in the control condition, it led to an increase in worldview defense in the mortality salient condition. Experiment 3 also showed that priming the partner led to less negative reactions to transgressions committed by their partners, even when death was experimentally primed. Overall, the results provided some support for the hypothesis that romantic partners can and do help to buffer people from anxieties about death.

1563,"Group identification, perception of control and fear of death:  The control hypothesis of group identification","The dissertation researches the possibility that reduced perception of control ({PC}) leads to increased group identification ({GRPID}). The first chapter reports results of a natural experiment in loss of {PC}-the impact of September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on {GRPID} of Penn undergraduates. Three classes of introductory psychology students at the University of Pennsylvania completed a survey including several measures of {GRPID} on 20 March 2001, 15 September 2001, and 24 March 2003. Importance of country and university were rated higher four days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks than six months before or eighteen months after. Scores on a nine-item scale of identification with country were higher immediately after 9/11 than at the other two assessments, and the factor structure of identification items was simpler. Discussion focuses on the impact of outgroup threat on ingroup cohesion, and on a more general suggestion that the losses of 9/11 could be perceived as loss of control. The second chapter reports research aimed at understanding mortality salience as a threat to {PC}. Studies of Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) indicate that increased salience of personal death leads to increased identification with cultural groups and their norms. Death is for many the ultimate failure of control, and the research reported here was designed to test the possibility that decreased perceived control can produce increased group identification. In Study 1, undergraduate participants asked to think of an uncontrollable future bad event reported lower {PC} and higher {GRPID} than participants thinking about a controllable future bad event. Most participants in the unpleasant-uncontrollable condition thought of death and no difference in {GRPID} was found between those who chose to write of death and those who wrote of other uncontrollable events.

1564,"Therapeutic innovations, diminishing returns, and control rate preservation","Acceptance of therapeutic innovations into practice requires demonstrating and quantifying a treatment effect, measured as the difference in outcome rates between experimental and control groups of a randomized trial. This mathematical dependency of the treatment effect on the control event rate creates a dilemma for medical innovation. Although decreasing control rates signal therapeutic progress, sustained innovation theoretically requires an inexhaustible control rate. For industries dependent on therapeutic innovations, reducing outcome rates becomes both a primary goal and an existential threat. In this Commentary, fundamental challenges of diminishing control rates and how trialists have responded are discussed, using examples from cardiovascular disease.

1565,Sentenced to die: Last statements and dying on death row,"Moments prior to execution, death row inmates are given time to say anything they desire. In these moments, what do inmates find most important to express? This study first examined the context of dying on death row. Conflicts over high death stigma (Silverman, 1994), just world beliefs (Lerner, 1980), system justification needs (lost \& Banaji, 1994), high death salience, lack of control, and facing their own crime were explored. Next, last statements were studied. Six themes, forgiveness, claims of innocence, silence, love/appreciation, activism and after life belief, were found. Lastly, suggestions for future research on death and dying on death row were made, with special attention paid to terror management theory (see Solomon, Greenberg, \& Pyszcynski, 2004 for review) and system justification theory (see Jost, Banaji, \& Nosek, 2004 for review).

1566,Mortality salience and consumer risk taking: Striving for personal control and self-esteem,"From a terror management perspective, this thesis argues that mortality salience ({MS}) causes consumers to become risk averse. Two mediators (the need for personal control and self-esteem striving) and a moderator (self-esteem relevance of the outcome of the risk) of this relationship are proposed. Three experiments show that {MS} leads to greater risk aversion, but allowing individuals to acquire control or to acquire self-esteem reduces the effect. A fourth study examines a boundary condition and looks at the effect of the self-esteem relevance of the risk on the risky choice. The research provides insights into how today's consumers deal with existential anxiety in risky choice settings.

1567,"The effects of mortality priming on audience tuning and recall bias and relational motivation and memory, a literature review","This study tests the effects of an increased need for affiliation on recall bias. Recall bias is the effect whereby a person remembers his own verbal report of information more than his initial experience of the information. Past studies have established that the recall bias only takes place when subjects report to audience members with whom they wish to create a shared reality. In our study, subjects are separated into mortality-salient and non-mortality salient groups. We investigate whether the mortality-salient group—who experience an increased need for the shared reality of affiliation—experience a higher recall bias than the non-mortality salient group does. Our findings show that mortality salience does positively influence recall bias. People invest in a group narrative when they have an increased need to share a reality with someone else.

1568,Existential function of babies: Babies as a buffer of death-related anxiety,"The present study examined babies as death anxiety buffers with Chinese participants in three experiments. In Experiment 1, death-related thoughts increased college-aged participants’ interest in human babies. In Experiment 2, images of newborn animals reduced the number of death-related thoughts recorded by college-aged participants. In Experiment 3, female factory workers who read news articles describing deaths of babies had pessimistic estimations of their own life expectancies. An explanation of these results is provided within a terror management theory framework, with a primary focus on how babies reinforce cultural world views and enhance self-esteem via the notion of symbolic immortality. Thus, the anxiety-buffering function of baby is subsumed under cultural world views validation and self-esteem enhancement.

In this thought-provoking volume, scholars from a diverse range of disciplines examine the complex motivational and situational factors contributing to terrorist acts and state-sponsored torture, and the potential linkage between those two heinous human behaviors. They also consider the strategies that might reduce the threat of future terrorist acts, and the perceived necessity to engage in morally reprehensible—and often illegal—torture practices. With its integrated synthesis of contemporary theories and research on the complex dynamics of the terrorism-torture link, this is an authoritative source for scholars and students of psychology, criminal justice, law, media, communication studies, and political science. It will also appeal to students of other disciplines with an interest in the study of terrorism and torture. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Stritzke, Werner G.

1570,"To be, or to be another me: An investigation of self-concept change in consumers","In two essays I investigate two antecedents of self-concept change in consumers: Threats to the self and the activated self-construal and its effect on goal conflict resolution. In the first essay, I explore identity strictly as consumers define themselves in terms of the possessions with which they associate. I argue that ironically the very effort to maintain self-consistency through living up to the value of materialism after facing a mortality salience threat can actually undermine consistency on the level of the extended self of highly materialistic consumers. Specifically, when faced with a mortality salience threat, the consistency of highly materialistic consumers' self-concept is disrupted in which they not only detach from formerly intrinsic possessions, but also make formerly extrinsic possessions a more central part of the extended self-concept. I further argue that consumers can be protected from a disruption to self-concept consistency through the process of self-affirmation. In the second essay, I explore how the activated self-construal impacts whether consumers maximize pleasure or engage in self-presentational behavior after they have been invited to choose a gift for themselves. I demonstrate that consumers with an independent (interdependent) self-construal make more indulgent (modest) gift choices for themselves, and that this effect is driven by the activation of a goal to maximize pleasure (behave normatively appropriate). I also identify a boundary condition: When consumers are able to satisfy their activated goal before selecting a gift, the effects cease to exist.

1571,Black Tuesday: The psychological impact of 9/11 - In the wake of 9/11:  The psychology of terror.,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) asserts that the uniquely human awareness of death, when juxtaposed with the natural inclination toward self-preservation common to all life, renders human beings prone to potentially overwhelming terror that is managed by the construction and maintenance of culture. Culture provides opportunities for individuals to perceive themselves as persons of value in a world of meaning and, in so doing, derive security in this world and symbolic or literal immortality in the next. Empirical support for terror management theory has been obtained from a large body of research demonstrating the anxiety-buffering properties of self-esteem and specific proximal and distal defensive reactions to thoughts of death that are in and outside current conscious awareness. This chapter explores how {TMT} can help us understand the psychological impact that Americans and many people the world over experienced in response to the events of 9/11.

1572,The machine in the ghost: A dual process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thought - Social motivation: Conscious and unconscious processes.,"The proposition that people are often unaware of the forces that lead them to do the things they do is one of the oldest, most widely accepted, but at times most controversial ideas in the history of psychology. Since psychology's inception, the popularity of accounts of behavior that emphasize unconscious motivational forces has waxed and waned. Although virtually all psychologists probably agree that people are typically not aware of all the forces and processes that determine their behavior, the idea that people's thoughts, feelings, and actions are driven by powerful fears and needs of which they are unaware is considerably more contentious. Building on earlier theorizing in existential philosophy and psychoanalytic psychology, Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) posits that a very deeply rooted fear of death unique to our species motivates a great deal of human behavior. A substantial literature consisting of over 170 separate studies conducted in at least nine different countries has accumulated over the past 15 years, supporting a variety of hypotheses derived from {TMT}. This research demonstrates that thoughts of death affect a broad range of human behavior, but that these effects occur in the absence of consciously experienced affect and occur primarily when death-related thoughts are on the fringes of consciousness. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of {TMT} and research, explore the cognitive and motivational processes engendered by death-related thoughts, more clearly explicate the role that potential affect plays in these processes, and review the empirical evidence supporting our dual process model of conscious and unconscious defense.

A significant mortality salience × argument source × strength of arguments interaction was found. In control conditions, Ss were more persuaded by strong than by weak arguments when the source of the persuasive appeal was a nonexpert, but not when the source was an expert.

1575,Ostracism: A Metaphor for Death - Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology.,"This chapter reports on our experimental investigations of the powerful and aversive social phenomenon of ostracism. Using a series of paradigms, these investigations demonstrate that ostracism threatens the need for belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. With occasional and infrequent exposure to ostracism episode, the reactions, whether they be prosocial or antisocial, reflect attempts to fulfill these threatened needs. We present evidence to suggest that ostracism may have the effect of making mortality salient and consequently provoke similar cultural worldview defenses as other mortality salience cues. We also discuss the long-term consequences of ostracism, which can lead to alienation, helplessness, depression, and feelings of worthlessness. Feeling nonexistent inevitably leads to a lack of will, purpose, and meaning. Both rage, in the short term, and impotent (existential) despair, in the long term, will invade the mind of the ostracized.

1576,"Cultural Trauma and Recovery: Cultural Meaning, Self-Esteem, and the Reconstruction of the Cultural Anxiety Buffer - Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology.","There is compelling evidence from a broad range of indicators to demonstrate that the indigenous peoples of the world experience a state of living and health that is well below acceptable standards. In most cases where this situation exists, the cause is attributed to the impact of colonization and its ongoing effects. Although such a view is clearly justified, the complexity and prevalence of psychological and well-being problems suffered by indigenous people today require deeper analysis. Consistent with the existential perspective taken in this book, we suggest that colonization brought about deep suffering for indigenous people due to the subsequent destruction of their culture, a vital source of existential meaning. In this chapter, we consider the human need for meaning in the context of the consequences of the traumatic disruption of culture and the resultant breakdown of systems of meaning and value for human beings. The experiences of cultural disruption of three groups of genetically distinct and geographically dispersed indigenous peoples will be examined from the existential framework provided by terror management theory ({TMT}) and research. Specifically, we use a {TMT} analysis to help comprehend the psychodynamics of what has been described as cultural trauma and the motive of genetically diverse and geographically dispersed peoples to recover, reconstruct, and apply traditional culture to current realities.

1578,'None of us will ever be the same again': Reactions of American midlife women to 9/11,"According to terror management theory ({TMT}), an event that heightens awareness of death produces the need to defend against existential anxiety. The horrifying events of September 11, 2001, created an unparalleled opportunity to apply {TMT} beyond the laboratory. This study examined post-9/11 stress and interview responses of a diverse community sample of American midlife women (aged 35-60 yrs). Education of the sample ranged from 12 to 23 years. Seventy-five percent had children and 70.6\% were married. Data analysis showed that 4 to 6 months after 9/11, 61\% of the women were still distressed, exhibiting symptoms of fear, sadness, anger, powerlessness, distrust, and vigilance. Highly stressed women differed in several respects from low-stress women. As predicted by {TMT}, core values central to a woman's world view were activated by 9/11. Patriotism and altruism increased, but bigotry intensified as well. Major changes were undertaken only by a small percentage, but all expressed the view, 'None of us will ever be the same again.'

Two new studies demonstrate that zealous pride and conviction insulate individuals from concern with uncertainty threats. The new studies further demonstrate that this insulation effect does not result from distraction, mood, or state self-esteem. It is proposed that the appeal of zeal arises from its ability to activate the approach-motivation system and to down-regulate the avoidance motivation system's vigilant concern with threats.

1580,Age-related differences in using subjective life expectancy estimates and social behaviors to manage death anxiety,"Terror management theory ({TMT}) has sparked renewed interest in death anxiety ({DA}) research. {TMT} posits that human beings rely primarily upon their self-esteem and cultural worldview to defend against {DA}. If so, then reminding individuals of their personal mortality should activate defensive social behaviors that reinforce self-esteem or cultural worldview. I postulated that an additional way individuals might cope with {DA} is to distort their subjective life expectancy estimates. One-hundred seventy-nine U.S. citizens (aged 18-to-29 and 65-to-84 years) participated in a cross-sectional study designed to test these hypotheses. In the experimental condition ({MS}; mortality salient), participants answered two open-ended questions about their own deaths. In the control condition ({TV}), participants engaged in an innocuous parallel writing task about their television viewing. Outcome measures included 4 worldview bolstering defensive social behaviors: reactions against a moral transgressor (bail bond for a prostitute), towards a heroine (reward for a crime informant), towards a worldview patron (evaluations of a target who wrote a salutary essay about America), and against a worldview detractor (evaluations of a target who wrote a critical essay about America). Two additional outcome measures included subjective life expectancy estimates. Flow, authoritarianism/tolerance, and religiosity measures were included as covariates, and measures of affect and sense-of-personal-control were included as manipulation checks. Consistent with {TMT}, both {MS} age-groups imposed a significantly higher bail bond for the prostitute and evaluated the worldview detractor less favorably than did their age-peers in the {TV} conditions, even though authoritarianism/tolerance was a significant covariate in both instances as was initial prostitution attitudes in the prostitute bond paradigm. Null results were found for the worldview patron and heroine outcome measures, as well as for subjective life expectancy estimates. Older-adults were significantly higher in religiosity and flow, and more realistic in terms of their hoped for life expectancy estimates compared to the younger-adults. {MS} effects were not mediated by affect, personal control, or by uncertainty or out-of-control states. Across outcome measures unique variance accounted for by {MS} was quite small, both in an absolute sense and relative to the moderating covariates which accounted for more variance than did {MS}.

1581,Giving peace a chance - In the wake of 9/11:  The psychology of terror.,"Terrorism results from the interaction of a wide range of social, political, ideological, and psychological forces. Terror management theory and research illuminate the psychological aspects of the problem. People need a worldview that provides a basis of self-worth and death transcendence, and they need to feel that they are contributing to some great cause--a heroic triumph over evil. And these needs are especially potent when mortality is salient, as it often is in the various flashpoints in the Middle East. Based on this analysis, the following two general goals must be met. First, through whatever methods are possible, we need to reduce the salience of mortality. Second, we need to help the people of the Middle East currently relying on extreme fundamentalist belief systems to shift to bases of meaning and self-worth that do not portray other groups as repositories of evil whom it is one's duty to eradicate. A solution to the crisis we are currently facing will require an interaction of peace-building steps, each one facilitating the success of the others.

1582,Existential underpinnings of approach and avoidance of the physical body,"In addition to enjoying pleasurable bodily activities, people appear threatened by the physical aspects of the body; they experience anxiety and inhibitions surrounding sex, eating, bodily appearance and functions. Based on terror management theory, we posit that people are dually motivated to approach the life-affirming properties of the physical body, and to avoid the physical or animalistic aspects of the body because of their association with death. This paper summarizes a substantial body of research, consisting of over twenty empirical studies, that identify personality and situational variables that interact with mortality concerns, moderating approach and avoidance attitudes and behaviors with respect to the physical body. We suggest that this dynamic motivation can go far in explaining the often observed ambivalence toward the body.

1584,I-D compensation theory: Some implications of trying to satisfy immediate-return needs in a delayed-return culture,"Explores the possibility that the effects of several general social psychological motives are moderated by the operation of a broader, perhaps more basic, system. According to I-D compensation theory, the occurrence of several social psychological phenomena (e.g., ego-defense, terror management) is moderated by the status of a person's relationship with the environment. More specifically, the theory proposes that individuals function optimally when they receive frequent feedback that they are progressing toward their goals and that their efforts will pay off. When individuals do not receive this feedback, they increase their reliance on mental processes such a simulation and problem solving. Although reliance on these processes may help individuals return to progress toward their goals, it also makes individuals especially vulnerable to the effects of various social psychological motives (e.g., ego-defense, terror management). From this perspective, certain phenomena thought to reflect basic motivations may actually be the product of context-dependent person-environment interactions. Also reports on 5 experiments that tested the effects of having one's mortality made salient. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Martin, Leonard L.",1,,1581
1585,"Understanding behavior in the context of time: Theory, research, and application","The goals of this book are twofold. One goal is to present a review of research on the psychological construct known as temporal orientation or time perspective. A second goal is to satisfy the need for a volume that brings together research from the varied domains of behavior that are influenced by time. The book is arranged around three classic levels of analysis (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and group-level processes). At the intrapersonal level of analysis, Lasane and O'Donnell (chap. 2) begin by reviewing various ways in which time perspective and temporal orientation have been conceptualized and measured. Nurmi (chap. 3) follows by discussing a process model of future orientation and studies addressing how time orientation develops over the life span. Routledge and Arndt (chap. 4) subsequently use terror management theory in an effort to understand the importance people place on time, and why, for instance, people may distance themselves from elderly persons. The next three chapters in this part focus more directly on the outcomes associated with various time orientations. The remaining chapters in Part {II} focus on how people navigate through time, how they think about events in the past, present, and future, and how temporal factors may impact attitudes and persuasion. The next part of the book focuses on the role of time within both interpersonal- and group-level processes. This book is intended for a professional audience including social, personality, health, environmental, and organizational psychologists.

1586,A perspective on the unique psychological function of soul belief,"Surprisingly little experimental research has explored the psychological function of soul belief given its prevalence. As some have noted (e.g., Rank, 1930/1998), soul belief may have evolved to help individuals cope with existential concerns through promises of literal immortality. The research that has been conducted on the function of literal immortality shows that belief in an afterlife minimizes death-related concerns (Dechesne et al., 2003). I propose two separate hypotheses testing the psychological function of soul belief. Hypothesis 1 states that soul belief should minimize the threat of a death reminder (or mortality salience; {MS}); this hypothesis was supported in Study 1 where soul believers did not show an increase in death-thought accessibility ({DTA}) following {MS}, but low soul believers did show an increase. Hypothesis 2 states that soul belief should also offer protection from threats to symbolic immortality related to the prospect of the end-of-world. Studies 2, 3, 4, and 6 support the reasoning behind this hypothesis. However, Study 5 did not support Hypothesis 2. Considering the data that did support Hypothesis 2, soul believers showed less resistance to end-of-world arguments and also did not show an increase in {DTA} following such arguments; whereas, low soul believers respond to end-of-world arguments with more resistance and heightened {DTA}. The discussion focuses on interpretations of these findings and remaining questions. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Weise, Dave",1,,1583
1587,The Roar of Awakening: Mortality Acknowledgment as a Call to Authentic Living - Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology.,"In making the case that acknowledgment of life's uncertainty and impermanence can facilitate more authentic living, we discuss the range of possible reactions that, according to several prominent existential philosophers, individuals might display when they come to realize their death is certain and the universe contains no objective, universally applicable, logically defensible standards of value. Then, we look for evidence of these possible reactions in the attitudinal and behavioral aftereffects observed in individuals who have had a close brush with death in the real world. We also consider some psychological mechanisms that could account for these aftereffects. After that, we synthesize the preceding strands of thought into a theoretical framework, and we report on three experiments that tested some implications of that framework. Finally, we explore the relation between our research and research suggesting that mortality salience leads to defensiveness and simple cognitive processing.

1588,Pride and prejudice: Fear of death and social behavior,"Terror management theory posits that awareness of mortality engenders a potential for paralyzing terror, which is assuaged by cultural worldviews: humanly created, shared beliefs that provide individuals with the sense they are valuable members of an enduring, meaningful universe (self-esteem), and hence are qualified for safety and continuance beyond death. Thus, self-esteem serves the fundamental psychological function of buffering anxiety. In support of this view, studies have shown that bolstering self-esteem reduces anxiety and that reminders of mortality intensify striving for self-esteem; this research suggests that self-esteem is critical for psychological equanimity. It is noted that cultural worldviews serve the fundamental psychological function of providing the basis for death transcendence. To the extent this is true, reminders of mortality should stimulate bolstering of one's worldview. It is maintained that more than 80 studies have supported this idea, most commonly by demonstrating that making death momentarily salient increases liking for people who support one's worldview and hostility toward those with alternative worldviews.

1589,How do People Grow from Their Experience with Trauma or Loss?,"Several studies of people coping with loss or trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common. Recent studies cast doubt on the meaning of such reports of growth, suggesting that the perception of growth may be illusory. From this perspective, perceiving growth may protect or buffer one from reminders of mortality. Using a modified Terror Management paradigm, the authors conducted two experiments involving 89 college students. The data from Study 1 (n=46) indicate that a brief recall of a traumatic episode from one's past leads one subsequently to more strongly affirm that one's life is meaningful relative to a control group. The results of Study 2 (n=43) indicate that reminders of death in conjunction with a threat to one's benign view of the world lead people to exaggerate the extent to which their life seems meaningful. It is argued that in the context of loss, people may actively seek positives or gains to defend against mortality threats engendered by the experience, and, if found, serve to promote the belief that life is meaningful.

1592,Intergroup bias,"This chapter reviews the extensive literature on bias in favor of in-groups at the expense of out-groups. We focus on five issues and identify areas for future research: (1) measurement and conceptual issues (especially in-group favoritism vs. out-group derogation, and explicit vs. implicit measures of bias); (2) modern theories of bias highlighting motivational explanations (social identity, optimal distinctiveness, uncertainty reduction, social dominance, terror management); (3) key moderators of bias, especially those that exacerbate bias (identification, group size, status and power, threat, positive-negative asymmetry, personality and individual differences); (4) reduction of bias (individual vs. intergroup approaches, especially models of social categorization); and (5) the link between intergroup bias and more corrosive forms of social hostility.

1593,The self-conscious emotions: Theory and research,"Emotion research has traditionally focused on a small set of 'basic'-level emotions, such as joy, fear, and anger. Yet recent years have seen significant advances in understanding another set of emotions--the 'self-conscious emotions'--which play a central role in motivating and regulating people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This authoritative volume reviews the breadth of current knowledge on the self-conscious emotions: embarrassment, guilt, humiliation, pride, and shame. Leading investigators approach the subject from multiple levels of analysis, ranging from basic brain mechanisms to complex social processes, and interweave cutting-edge theories, methods, and empirical findings in this dynamic area. The book thoroughly examines how the self-conscious emotions differ from other emotions, why they might have evolved, and the many ways they help (and hurt) the self. It addresses their underlying social, cognitive, physiological, and neural mechanisms, as well as developmental contexts and processes. Several chapters explore cross-cultural differences and similarities. State-of-the-science research is presented on each of the specific emotions, elucidating and elaborating on the fine-grained distinctions among them. Special topics include the importance of self-conscious emotions for understanding altruism, achievement, antisocial behavior, narcissism, nationalism, and terror management. An invaluable chapter on assessment describes and evaluates all available self-report and nonverbal measures of each self-conscious emotion. Throughout, the volume clearly demonstrates how far the field has progressed over the last decade, while also identifying important directions for future investigation. Timely, comprehensive, and thought-provoking, this book is essential reading for anyone interested in the interface of emotions and self-processes. Researchers and students in social, personality, developmental, and clinical psychology will find it a uniquely informative reference and text.

1594,Cultural trauma and recovery: Perspectives from terror management theory,"This article examines an essential psychological function of culture and the consequences of its traumatic disruption from the perspective of terror management theory. The experience of indigenous peoples in their contact with Europeans and the social, psychological, and behavioral consequences of that traumatic contact constitute the focus of this examination. Culture, it is suggested, serves as a psychological defense cooperatively constructed to manage the terror inherent in human existence and allow anxiety-prone human organisms to act adaptively. Implications for mental health professionals working with culturally diverse populations and with people seeking to recover, clarify, and affirm their cultural foundations are considered.

1595,The interplay of worldviews and heuristics in the processing of persuasive messages,"A person's worldview might moderate the way a persuasive message is processed, sometimes in the opposite direction of that intended by communicators. This dissertation explored the possibility that a worldview can influence the way a persuasive message is perceived. Building on the construct of worldview, the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion, and terror management theory, this dissertation examined the question in a between-participants post-test only 2 (expertise cue) X 2 (argument quality) X 2 (mortality salience) X a relativist worldview (a measured variable) experiment (N = 149). Some participants in the experiment were reminded of their eventual death, while others were asked to think of watching television. Then, participants' tendency toward a relativist or traditional worldview was assessed. Participants viewed mock ads that featured either strong or weak arguments and had either an expertise cue or no cue at all, after which they rated the ads in terms of their attitudes toward the ad (A ad), the attitudes toward the brand (Abrand), and behavioral intentions. Worldview had a main effect on global evaluations of the ads, such that participants who tended toward a relativist worldview had lower evaluation of the ads and lower behavioral intentions. Mortality salience was found to moderate participants' worldview, presumably making their worldview more accessible in evaluating the ads. This dissertation also found separate main effects for worldview and argument quality on attitude toward the ad and attitude toward the brand, respectively. The implications for the heuristic-systematic model and terror management theory are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Magee, Robert Gerald",1,,1592
1596,Terror management theory,"Comments on the article 'In the Wake of 9/11: The Psychology of Terror' by author Lynn E. {DeLisi}. The dismissive review by Lynn E. {DeLisi} of the book 'In the Wake of 9/11: The Psychology of Terror' (see record [rid]2002-18510-000[/rid]) failed to grasp the significance of an important theory being put to extensive, ingenious, and successful testing. The book addresses death awareness and its consequences in individual and group behavior. The book's focus is the half-hidden everyday terror that lurks everywhere: plain, ordinary, inevitable death. The coauthors, psychologists whose research on terror management theory is known to readers of scholarly journals, summarize it here for a larger audience. This research tests ways in which awareness of death directly affects feelings, attitudes, and behavior. In the deathsalient condition, prejudice emerges against an out group. The studies locate the genesis of terror and explain its expression, effects, and responses. A rare example of validation of a depth-psychological hypothesis, this work deserves to be studied and further developed by psychiatrists.

1597,Transcending self-interest: Psychological explorations of the quiet ego,"For decades social scientists have observed that Americans are becoming more selfish, headstrong, and callous. Instead of lamenting a cultural slide toward narcissism, Transcending Self-Interest: Psychological Explorations of the Quiet Ego provides a constructive framework for understanding--and conducting research on--both the problems of egocentrism and the ways of transcending it. Heidi A. Wayment and Jack J. Bauer have assembled a group of contributors who are helping to reshape how the field of psychology defines the self in the 21st century. In the spirit of positive psychology, these authors call us to move beyond individualistic and pathological notions of self versus other. Their theories and research suggest two paths to this transcendence: (a) balancing the needs of self and others in one's everyday life and (b) developing compassion, nondefensive self-awareness, and interdependent self-identity. At the end of these converging paths lies a quiet ego--an ego less concerned with self-promotion than with the flourishing of both the self and others. Readers will find in this volume inspiration not only for future work in psychology but also for their own efforts toward personal development.

1598,The malleability of community sentiment: Contextual explanations for shifts in attitudes toward gay rights,"Researchers (e.g., Castro-Convers, 2005; Herek, 2002; Hicks \& Lee, 2006) have investigated demographic (e.g., gender and political affiliation) and experiential (e.g., contact) predictors of attitudes towards gays and lesbians and gay rights. However, little attention has been paid to understanding how attitudes are influenced by the context in which they occur. The current research furthered this line of work by determining if and how attitudes toward gay rights (and gays and lesbians) can be shaped by specific contextual factors. Two social cognitive theories guided the focus of this research: Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) was employed to determine how reminders of violence and death can impact attitudes toward gay rights and Construal Level Theory ({CLT}) was used to determine how social and spatial distance from a target or event can impact judgments. Study 1 tested the impact of mortality salience ({MS}) and psychological distance, and Study 2 tested the impact of reminders of terrorist attacks, on participant judgments about gay rights issues. Results revealed that individuals are susceptible to contextual influences when making judgments. Specifically, Study 1 revealed that {MS} led to positive judgments about a gay marriage initiative (among ambivalent participants) and Study 2 revealed that written reminders of the Madrid Train bombing led to negative judgments about gay rights issues. Given that community sentiment does play a role in lawmaking, the findings from this research provide a way to better understand previous legal decisions and predict future laws regarding the rights of gays and lesbians.

1601,"The relationship between affect balance, self-care behavior, and secondary traumatic stress reactions","Trauma workers have reported symptoms similar to posttraumatic stress when working with severely traumatized clients. These symptoms have been grouped into a global construct called secondary traumatic stress (Chrestman, 1995; Figley, 1995a; Kassam-Adams, 1995; Stamm, 1997). Research regarding primary and secondary traumatic stress has evolved into a formal area of study called psychotraumatology that investigates the impact of trauma on a client and a helping practitioner. This study assessed trauma worker-who hold a state approved certification for counseling sexual assault victims or who are licensed, who hold paid or volunteer positions, and who work with survivors of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual victimization. This investigation examined the relationship between symptoms of secondary traumatic stress and personal resources in the form of affective balance and self-care behavior. Questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data about affect, secondary trauma symptoms, and self-care behavior. The survey battery distributed to participants gathered the data of interest using a background questionnaire, the Derogatis Affect Balance Scale (Derogatis, 1975, 1996), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983), the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (Derogatis, 1977, 1983, 1994), the {ProQOL}: Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout and Fatigue Scale, Version (Stamm 2005), and the Trauma Attachment and Belief Scale ({TABS}, Western Psychological Services, 2003). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between the dependent variable constructs (compassion fatigue, vicarious traumatic reactions, general stress severity, objective indicators of work-related stress), and the independent variables of affective balance and self-care behavior. Based on appraisal theory (Lazarus, 1991b, 1991c, 1999, 2001; Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984, see also Aspinwall \& Taylor, 1992; Taylor \& Aspinwall, 1996), constructivist self-development theory (Pearlman \& Saakvitne, 1995), terror management theory (Greenberg, Solomon, \& Pyszczynski, 1997; Pennington, 2000), and transactional theory (Karpman, 1968; see also Choy, 1990), it was hypothesized that the results of this investigation would show that trauma workers who are found to be affectively in balance and are most attentive to health-promoting behaviors will be the least impacted by secondary traumatic reactions. Results showed that affect balance and self-care accounted for a significant portion of the variance in the secondary trauma indices of vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue and global stress severity. Theoretical and practical implications of these within-group differences are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Thomas, Barbara Jean",0,,1598
1602,Mortality salience and the implicit God concept: Examining religious cognition using the emotional stroop and free recall tasks,"From a cognitive science of religion perspective, the current study explored Fundamentalist, religiously mature, and atheist groups' implicit concepts of God using the emotional Stroop and free recall tasks. The emotional Stroop task in this study consisted of asking individuals to read positive and negative stimulus cards containing words pertaining to God. By supplying incongruent stimuli, this task is thought to measure cognitive bias, thereby revealing core schemata. Free recall in this study consisted of asking subjects to remember in an impromptu manner as many words as possible presented on the Stroop cards. Free recall is thought to reveal the most salient schematic representations within an individual's mind. Results indicated that Fundamentalists who were not primed to contemplate their own death demonstrated a Stroop facilitation effect for negatively valenced word groupings regarding God. In contrast, those Fundamentalists who were primed demonstrated Stroop interference for negatively valenced word groupings regarding God. The religiously mature group demonstrated Stroop interference for positively valenced words regarding God and when primed, the degree of Stroop interference increased relative to the religiously mature who were not primed. The findings from the memory task revealed bias for recall of negatively valenced words regarding God within the Fundamentalist group and an enhancement of that recall when this group was primed. Biased recall for positively valenced words was demonstrated in the religiously mature group and an enhancement of that recall occurred when this group was primed. Implications and suggestions for future research are also discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Maloney, Michelle Q.",1,,1599
1603,Religious orientation and responses to anxiety: The mediating role of trust,"This research experimentally manipulated death anxiety and examined its effects on social, spiritual, and self-support. Individual level of religiosity was examined as a moderating variable. Various forms of trust were examined as potential mediators of the relationship between death anxiety and sources of support. The participants' ages ranged from 17–48 ( M = 22.13 {SD} = 6.30), including 141 females and 39 males. A marginally significant interaction (p = .09) was found between experimental condition and participant level of religiosity in predicting general support by God, such that intrinsic religiosity predicted general support by God most strongly in the anxiety condition, compared to the mortality salience and control conditions. Trust was not found to be a significant mediator of the link between anxiety and support. This project was the first to combine intrinsic religiosity and a mortality salience manipulation in predicting preferred choices of support.

1604,"Spirituality, fear of cancer recurrence, and fear of death","Fear plays an important role in human survival behavior. In Western culture, excessive anxiety is viewed as a destructive force, which is enhanced by illness. Many still view cancer as a death sentence; however, survival rates have risen dramatically among female breast cancer survivors. While the literature on spirituality and fear of cancer recurrence is growing, there remains an important gap in the current literature regarding possible relationships between (a) spirituality and fear of recurrence and (b) fear of death in breast cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to identify whether or not the independent variables of spirituality and fear of recurrence are significant predictors of fear of death in female breast cancer survivors residing in the United States. Terror management theory posits that death anxiety is a real and basic fear, death fear grows out of the fear of living, and coping with a crisis can lead to positive intrinsic change. Participants included a convenience sample of 32 female breast cancer survivors living in the United States. Participants completed the Assessment of Survivor Concerns ({ASC}), the Revised Collett-Lester Fear of Death Scale ({CL}-{FODS}), the Revised Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale ({SIBS}-R), and a demographic questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis indicated a significant relationship between fear of recurrence and fear of death but not between spirituality and fear of death. The findings of this study can promote positive social change by providing professionals who treat female breast cancer survivors with the knowledge to develop effective interventions that will help to decrease anxiety and fear and improve quality of life in breast cancer survivors.

1605,Assessing advance directives in the homebound elderly,"We studied the prevalence of specific barriers that prevent indigent homebound older adults from obtaining advance directives and tested the effectiveness of clinical reminders for lowering the number of clients without advance directives. Case managers interviewed 1569 clients to determine whether they had an advance directive. All 530 clients without advance directives were contacted 3 months later to determine if advance directives had been obtained. Clients who still did not have advance directives were asked to list 1 or more reasons they did not have advance directives. About 57.8\% of the barriers identified may reflect reluctance on the part of clients to address their own mortality. Reminders by the case managers were ineffective at lowering the number of homebound older adults without advance directives. Further studies are needed to identify and design strategies for convincing this population of homebound elderly to establish advance directives.

1606,A multiple-case study exploring personal paradigm shifts throughout the psychotic process from onset to full recovery,"The aim of the dissertation was to explore how the personal paradigms of those who have recovered from long-term psychosis changed throughout the psychotic process, from onset to full recovery. My hope was that such an inquiry might provide us with useful information regarding what takes place during the psychotic process at the most fundamental (existential) level of experience, and that perhaps this information might offer some guidelines and perhaps even a more or less universal map that can be of service to others who are still struggling with psychosis. Qualitative multiple-case study methodology was used to inquire into the experience of six participants who had suffered from long-term psychosis and who are now considered to be fully recovered. Data collection consisted of an initial questionnaire, one live interview of a minimum of one hour, and three follow-up email interviews. A quantitative instrument was also used (the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory) to supplement the qualitative data. Data analysis consisted of developing individual and cross case themes for each of six prefigured categories of experience: description of the anomalous experiences, the onset and deepening of psychosis, recovery, lasting personal paradigm shifts, lasting benefits, and lasting harms. After exhaustive analysis of the data, a theoretical model was formulated that assisted in discussing the implications of the data. The results revealed that all six participants had striking parallels in their experiences with regard to all six categories of experience. The most central implications that emerged from the findings with regard to all participants are as follows: an overwhelming existential threat to the self apparently played an important role in the onset of psychosis; the psychotic process was likely initiated by the psyche as an attempt to regain equilibrium in the face of this threat; recovery was primarily assisted by reconnecting with hope, meaning, a sense of agency, and the cultivation of healthy relationships; psychiatry generally caused significantly more harm than benefit in the process of recovery; and the successful resolution of the psychotic process apparently involved a profound reorganization of the self along with significantly more lasting benefits than harms.

1607,Scared to death: Capital punishment as authoritarian terror management,"This dissertation addresses American capital punishment's fundamental contradiction. It offers a comprehensive theory to explain why, despite growing evidence against its instrumental value-its failure substantially to accomplish the penological goals usually attributed to it (deterrence, retribution, and incapacitation), its fantastic financial cost, and a general abolitionist trend among developed nations world-wide-the institution is flourishing wildly here. I draw on a social psychological theory known as 'terror management' to show how American capital punishment is best understood as a largely non-conscious, symbolic defense against the incipient terror provoked by awareness of death. When reminded of their own mortality, people deploy a mostly non-conscious defensive process that reduces anxiety by enhancing self-esteem through identification with and protection of cultural worldview. This worldview defense against fear of death-awareness manifests in behaviors and attitudes specifically relevant to capital punishment: punishment: hyperpunitiveness, aggression, and authoritarianism (i.e., hostility against outgroups and favoritism toward ingroups). In other words, in a death-related context, people tend to take comfort in inflicting extra punishment on others who appear threatening. Capital punishment is especially likely to provoke this 'terror management effect' because it is both a reminder of mortality and itself a threat to worldview. I explain that a terror management theory of capital punishment accounts for the four attributes that characterize the death penalty in America: arbitrariness, excessiveness, discrimination, and dehumanization. I argue that, as a non-conscious, symbolic defense against fear of death awareness rather than an instrumental response to crime, i.e., as the ritualized sacrifice of a degraded 'outsider', capital punishment as actually practiced in America fails the basic constitutional requirement of rationality. I conclude on a pessimistic note, observing that there will probably be many more executions before judicial or legislative self-inquiry yields much reform.

1608,The impact of imagining partner loss and mortality salience on romantic relationship satisfaction,"It has been suggested in the literature that we can learn to better appreciate what we currently have-especially our most cherished relationships-if we imagine the loss of that which we value. Unlike actual loss, imagined loss gives us the benefit of being able to appreciate our loved ones before they die. It is also relevant to consider whether imagining one's own death can cause an individual to have more favorable attitudes about their relationship. As hypothesized, imagining the death of one's romantic partner (for those currently involved in a romantic relationship for at least one continuous year) enhanced relationship satisfaction; unexpectedly, however, imagining one's own death did not markedly affect relationship satisfaction (Experiment 1). Two other follow-up experimental studies were conducted. Experiment 2 found that imagining the death of one's partner has a similar impact as imagining a positive experience with one's partner in terms of relationship satisfaction; this study also, unexpectedly, found that imagining the death of one's romantic partner causes the individual to favorably change their perceptions of certain personality characteristics of his or her partner. Experiment 3 considers the possible interactive effects that certain personality traits may have on imagining either the death of oneself or one's romantic partner with respect to self-reported relationship satisfaction: It was found that agreeableness, and positive and negative affect are especially important individual differences to consider. While this is a programmatic line of applied research, it also has much relevance to many areas in the psychological literature. Both the applied and theoretical implications of this research are extensively discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Miller, Eric Darren",0,,1605
1609,A study on the relationship of death anxiety and the completion of advance directives for oncology social workers,"This study examined the extent to which the death anxiety of oncology social workers impacts the facilitation of the completion of their personal advance directives, and communication about advance directives with patients. Members of the Association of Oncology Social Work completed death anxiety and advance directive communication practices survey instruments. Terror Management Theory and Personal Construct Theory guided the examination of the results. Respondents having more years of work experience reported higher death anxiety scores. And, as the death anxiety scores increased the communication scores decreased related to disclosure of information about advance directives and values in living. In spite of limitations, the study findings contribute to the furthering of understanding oncology social workers in this context. The combined use of Terror Management Theory and Personal Construct Theory has seldom been used to study oncology social workers and the statistically significant findings suggest future research may be warranted.

1610,The death of the self: Older adults' anxiety concerning cognitive decline,"According to terror management theory ({TMT}), humans' awareness of their finite nature creates the potential for tremendous anxiety. {TMT} research has revealed that younger adults frequently fend off existential anxiety via defense of their self-esteem and worldviews. However, older individuals do not appear to employ the same defenses. It remains unclear whether older adults have developed new ways of coping with their mortality or if mortality is no longer their primary source of anxiety. The present dissertation presents an initial investigation of the latter possibility, suggesting that older adults may become increasingly concerned with outcomes viewed as worse than death. More specifically, older adults frequently report concern about developing cognitive impairment, which could present a different kind of existential problem: the death of self. If cognitive impairment is a threat to the integrity of the self for older adults, they may exhibit increased defense of self-certainty following reminders of cognitive impairment similar to that observed among younger adults reminded of mortality. Following reminders of death, cognitive impairment, or control topics, younger and older adults were asked to rate their self-certainty. Results did not support the hypothesis; potential explanations are discussed. This study also investigated the possibility that older adults are still threatened by death, but defend against this fear in domains of particular relevance to their lives. It was hypothesized that death reminders would influence older but not younger adults' concern about cognitive impairment and performance on a cognitive screen. Indeed, older adults reminded of death reported lower concern about cognitive impairment than older adults in control conditions. This reduction likely reflects a defensive denial of this concern, which helps minimize existential anxiety; younger adults' concern about cognitive impairment did not vary. Older adults varied in performance on a cognitive screen. Older participants recruited from a community emphasizing intellectual engagement made fewer errors when reminded of death, while older adults from a community without continuing education committed more errors when reminded of death. The fact that older adults in an environment encouraging cognitive engagement responded to death reminders with improved cognitive performance provides support for the proposition that cognitive functioning has the potential to buffer against existential security. Implications of the present results and limitations of the study are addressed, as well as future directions for research in the area of older adults and management of anxiety related to death and cognitive impairment.

1611,Understanding when and why victims are blamed: The role of personal and system threat,"Past research on victim blaming has focused on (a) individual difference variables that may make a person more likely to endorse victim blame and (b) characteristics of the victim or situation that may elicit variations in victim blame. Little research has focused on examining the perceiver's motivation to blame a victim, which would elucidate the thought process that makes people blame others. The primary aim of the current project was to extend the victim blaming literature to assess different threats that may motivate a person to endorse victim blame. Bridging various theoretical perspectives (just world, terror management, and system justification), I examined the role of threats to a person's well-being (i.e., personal threat) and threats to a person's way of life (i.e., system threat) on perceptions of victim blame. It was hypothesized that making a threat salient would result in increases in victim blame, particularly when the type of victim reaffirmed the salient threat. Study 1 provided initial support for the link between threats to a person's way of life and blaming a wife for her husband's abuse. Study 2 tested specific conditions related to system threat and victim blame. This study was a between subjects experiment in which participants were primed with one type of threat (system threat, personal threat, control) and then asked to rate a victim that either reaffirmed the threat (system noncompliant victim) or was not related to the threat (system compliant victim). When a threat to the current system was made salient, a perceiver was more likely to blame the system noncompliant victim. Study 3 found similar results by assessing conditions related to personal threat. When a personal threat was made salient, a victim that reaffirmed the threat (a personally similar victim) was blamed more than a victim that was not related to the threat (a personally dissimilar victim). All three studies found that type of threat to a perceiver is an important variable that should be considered when assessing victim blame. Implications for research on victim blaming are discussed.

1612,Searching under stress: Anxiety and selective information exposure,"For centuries, political philosophers have argued that emotion clouds rational judgment and should be avoided at all costs. In light of advances made in the fields of social cognition, political science, and social psychology, however, the question of how affective states work in conjunction with cognitive processes has been approached anew, and interesting patterns have emerged in the data. They theory of affective intelligence (Marcus, Neuman, \& {MacKuen}, 2000) posits that emotional arousal, particularly anxiety, alerts organisms to gather and evaluate information from the environment that can be useful for self-protection. On the other hand, terror management theory (Solomon, Greenberg, \& Pyszczynski, 2002) predicts that anxious individuals will protect themselves from information that is death-related or that threatens their worldview. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if preference for information exposure changes following a threat. Anxiety was manipulated through faux online news articles about nuclear terrorism. After reading the articles, participants spent time exploring a website that contained links to further information about terrorism, some of which reassured the participants of their safety, some of which further threatened their sense of well-being. The order in which the links were clicked and the amount of time spent on each webpage was recorded for each participant. Additionally, participants completed the Need for Evaluation Scale (Jarvis \& Petty, 1996), the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (Miller, 1987), and the Brief Big Five Personality Inventory (Gosling, Renfrow, \& Swann, 2003) in order to assess individual differences. Although anxiety increased for participants reading an unsafe message about nuclear power, no differences were found between the experimental groups in their preference for information. Overall, participants strongly preferred threatening information, spending roughly three times as long on the threatening websites than on reassuring websites. While high scores on the Need for Evaluation scale predicted less time spent on the threatening websites, the other individual difference measures failed to predict level of information exposure. Overall, the results of this study indicate that following a threat, the preference for information that further heightens anxiety is stronger than the preference for information that would assuage fear.

1613,"The narrative stalemate: Conflict, identity and the cultural psychology of Israeli and Palestinian adolescence","Assuming a cultural psychology approach to the study of life-course development and a narrative approach to the study of identity, this dissertation examined adolescent identity development in the context of political conflict. From 2003 to 2006, fieldwork was conducted in two American-based programs for intergroup contact between Palestinian and Israeli youth, as well as in community field sites in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Out of approximately 450 youth observed and informally assessed in these field settings, a sample of 45 youth was recruited for intensive life-story interviews. Narratives of youth revealed considerable conformity to master narratives of collective identity, although youth challenged certain thematic elements as well. In particular, the narrative tone and form of individual life stories closely paralleled that of the ingroup master narrative. The content of these narratives revealed great psychological distance from one another along the lines of social identity, which may be characteristic of the context of conflict in which identities become polarized as a consequence of perceived existential threat. The experience of intergroup contact, although intended to elicit a process of identity recategorization among youth, in which a decrease in the salience of ingroup identity occurs, ultimately served to accentuate ingroup social identity and to contribute to the convergence of individual life stories with master narratives that reproduce the conflict. Findings suggest that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be characterized as a stalemate of master narratives which are reproduced by youth, regardless of attempts at identity intervention. Findings also suggest the importance of a cultural approach to both the study of adolescence and to research and practice in intergroup contact.

1614,"More evidence for a security system model of attachment, self-esteem, and worldviews: The effects of security boosts on defensiveness","According to the 'security system' model of defensiveness (Hart, Shaver, \& Goldenberg, 2005), which is based on integrating attachment theory and terror management theory (e.g., Mikulincer, Florian, \& Hirschberger, 2003), attachment, self-esteem, and cultural meaning systems or worldviews are roughly interchangeable mechanisms that function interdependently to maintain psychological security. One major hypothesis derived from the model concerns fluid compensation: Bolstering either attachment, self-esteem, or belief systems should increase overall security, thereby rendering each mechanism temporarily less likely to be activated. The two studies reported here tested this fluid compensation hypothesis, completing a series of systematic experiments testing the model's assumption about interchangeability. In Study 1, participants whose self-esteem was raised reported feeling more secure in their relations with others. In Study 2, participants whose sense of attachment security was raised were less defensive in response to a self-esteem threat from negative personality feedback. The discussion centers on the contributions and implications of the security system model. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)","Hart, Joshua John Edward",0,,1611
1615,"Aberglaube, Glaube, Wahn = Superstition, faith, illusion","Asserts that the superstitious person makes use of projective mechanisms and establishes a connection between two events or between an object and an event that are not causally related. Superstition can be understood as a narcissistic attempt at compensation by persons lacking self-confidence who feel themselves to be under an existential threat. Religious belief is defined as a commitment to an ultimate meaning in life, and absolute faith requires hope. A prerequisite and underlying emotional substrate in the development of faith is basic trust. A characteristic of genuine religious belief is orthopraxy, the practical application of faith in the world. The integrity of religious belief is vulnerable, and unlike delusion, can be modified. Delusion is a disturbance of thought content that is maintained with absolute conviction; the deluded person is not capable of doubting or correcting the false belief. Transition from faith to superstition and vice versa is often fluid. Superstition can be the starting point for delusional ideas and must be distinguished from delusion: The superstitious person feels secure in his world, while the deluded person breaks out of this security and the supportive community and society.

1616,What's death got to do with it? The role of psychological uncertainty on implicit death accessibility,"Terror management theory ({TMT}; Solomon, et al, 1991) asserts that the awareness of the inevitability, uncontrollability and possible finality of death is at the root of most human anxiety; and, that a substantial portion of human activity manifested in a wide variety of seemingly unrelated behaviors serve to manage the anxiety engendered by thoughts of our own demise. According to {TMT}, combined with a strong sense of self-esteem, a firm belief in a just and meaningful cultural worldview allows people to function normally despite the potentially incapacitating fear resulting from our knowledge that we will, without a doubt, die. Cultural worldviews are assumed to reduce death concerns by creating a realm in which an individual can immerse his or her life and by doing so become an integral part of that realm and live on through the continued existence of that culture thus, at least symbolically conquering death. Worldview defense (e.g. showing increased support for those who share one's worldview and increased animosity towards those who violate ones worldview) appears to be engendered whenever thoughts of death are highly accessible, but not directly in focal attention. According to {TMT} heightened implicit death thought accessibility is a sufficient and necessary factor responsible for the production of defensive worldview bolstering behaviors. Recently however, researchers (e.g. {McGregor}, et al, 2001; van den Bos, 2001) have proposed that the worldview defensive behaviors are better accounted for by psychological uncertainty, and not death. These theorists assert that reminders of death are problematic because they instill a sense of uncertainty in the individual. {McGregor} et al (2001, 1998) demonstrated that making people 'uncertain' produced worldview defense in the apparent absence of heightened death accessibility supporting their proposed role of uncertainty in worldview defense. The experiments presented in this dissertation examined implicit death accessibility following an uncertainty manipulation. Results indicated that uncertainty produced heightened death accessibility under a variety of situations. Uncertainty therefore appears to be psychologically problematic to the extent that it engenders implicit concerns about death. Consequently, the {TMT} claim that heightened death accessibility is necessary and sufficient to produce worldview defensive behavior is still sound.

1617,Religiousness and suicidal denial in south central Idaho,"Investigations of suicide and religiousness have previously relied upon measures of suicide acceptability among individuals or rates of completed suicide among geographically determined populations of people rather than upon analysis of suicidality and religiousness per se. In this study, suicide deniers were hypothesized to rate higher in religiousness than would serious ideators. Religiousness, hopelessness, and suicide ideation were assessed among 279 college students in South Central Idaho. Most were non-suicidal. The ad hoc Perception of Personal Religiousness Scale ({PPRS}) showed convergent validity with the Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale-Revised ({SIBS}-R). {LDS} participants rated higher in religiousness than did others. The hypothesis was not confirmed. Hopeful ideators (an unexpected category in which persons were suicidal but not hopeless) rated low in religiousness. Religiousness did not otherwise co-vary with suicidality. Concepts from Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) were provided to interpret the results in tandem with Durkheimian social integration and rational suicide.

1618,Beyond conflict:  The structure and purposes of genocide in the 20th century,"This study sets out to explore the etiology of genocide as a form of conflict. Based on comparison of ten cases (Ache of Paraguay, Ottoman Armenians, Burundi, Bosnia, Cambodia, Herero, Indonesia, Maya, Nazi, and Rwanda), a conflict theory of genocide in the 20th century is developed, centered around the functions of genocide for the organizers and the structural conditions that enables it to occur. The dissertation includes a substantial write-up of each case and concludes with ideas for genocide transformation. It is argued that genocide is inherently a political phenomenon; it is 'about' obtaining and maximizing power and control. Genocide is functionally useful for regime consolidation (establishing hegemony), regime expansion (forcible incorporation of new resources), and regime maintenance (eliminating threat). Distinctions are made between the intent of the perpetrator (genocide as instrumental tactic versus integral goal) and primary motives (political, economic, strategic). The perpetrators assume the power to define and choose their victims, who are typically seen as either active or implicit communities of resistance . They are perceived as either an 'existential threat' to the safety and well-being of the regime's constituency or as a' strategic obstacle' that must be eliminated to achieve the regime's ideal. Each case was studied systematically to ascertain the existence and relative salience of 38 pre-identified factors and to identify other patterns in the dynamics and structure of genocide within and across cases. These factors comprise situational characteristics (economic and social stress), historical factors, group identity and ideological characteristics, positional dynamics in the victim/perpetrator relationship, political and regime factors, strategic factors, and international relations characteristics. Regime characteristics are identified as the primary causal factors in genocide. The other factors are significant in: (a) enabling the emergence of a genocidal regime; (b) supporting the mobilization of a genocidal movement; (c) facilitating implementation of a genocidal plan. These form the genocidal calculus: the factors that accelerate the motivation and potential success of genocide in the perpetrator's calculations, countered by the factors that decelerate its development. An activist approach to genocide transformation is advocated based on addressing the needs for recognition, justice, political transformation, development, and reconciliation.

The deadly {COVID}-19 pandemic presents a rare opportunity to test whether existential threat stemming from an indiscriminate virus moderates the relationship between authoritarianism and political attitudes toward the nation and out-groups. Using data from two large nationally representative samples of adults in the United Kingdom (N = 2,025) and Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) collected during the initial phases of strict lockdown measures in both countries, we find that the associations between right-wing authoritarianism ({RWA}) and (1) nationalism and (2) anti-immigrant attitudes are conditional on levels of perceived threat. As anxiety about the {COVID}-19 pandemic increases, so too does the effect of {RWA} on those political outcomes. Thus, it appears that existential threats to humanity from the {COVID}-19 pandemic moderate expressions of authoritarianism in society.","Hartman, Todd K. and Stocks, Thomas V.

Thus, this manuscript aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of a new measure, Assessment of {COVID}-19 Attitudes and Behaviors ({ACAB}), that assesses {COVID}-19-related attitudes (e.g., about physical distancing, xenophobia), behaviors (e.g., helping others versus prioritizing own needs), and beliefs (e.g., about others' roles in spreading {COVID}-19). We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses ({EFA}, {CFA}) to provide factor analytic support and Fisher's r-to-z transformation to provide construct validity evidence. {EFA} revealed and {CFA} confirmed a four-factor structure of social distancing adjustment, self-prioritization, prosocial behaviors, and belief in conspiracies. Fisher's r-to-z transformation provided evidence for the construct validity of the four factors. This psychometrically validated instrument will enhance social science researchers' ability to accurately identify and explicate psychological processes related to {COVID}-19.","Silverstein, Madison W. and Mekawi, Yara and Alonzi, Sarah P. and La Torre, Adelaide",0,,1617
1621,Insecurity orientations: A person-centered approach to existential concerns,"This research explores the ways in which psychological insecurities in three domains-the self, meaning, and relationships-are distributed intra-individually. Specifically, we explore the hypothesis that certain profiles of insecurity are associated with sociocultural and personality indicators. Building upon recent theorizing regarding psychological security (Hart, 2014) and cultural-existential psychology (Sullivan, 2016), two studies (N = 1049) support the existence of hypothesized ""insecurity orientations."" Insecurities tended to distribute intra-individually in accordance with three insecurity prototypes: Social Concern (relatively concerned with relationships and unconcerned with meaning), Meaning Concern (relatively concerned with meaning and unconcerned with relationships), and Secure (relatively secure in all resources). Using the resultant cluster solutions as a foundation, theorized differences in sociocultural (e.g., religiosity, political orientation, individualism-collectivism) and personality indicators (e.g., attachment and the Big Five) are investigated. Results support the hypothesized relationships between insecurity orientations and sociocultural and personality variables (e.g., meaning-concerned individuals are less religious than socially-concerned individuals). Implications for global wellbeing are then considered, including the possibility that insecurity orientations may leave individuals more vulnerable to some types of distress than others (e.g., anxiety vs. depression).","Young, Isaac F. and Sullivan, Daniel and Hart, Joshua and Palitsky, Roman",0,,1618
1622,A Cognitive Uncoupling: Masculinity Threats and the Rejection of Relationship Interdependence,"What happens when a primary resource people draw from in times of need is at odds with maintaining a threatened, yet valued, identity? Four studies (N-total= 806) examined whether men cognitively disengage from romantic relationships following masculinity threats. As hypothesized, romantically attached men reported less closeness, commitment, and interdependence in their romantic relationships (Study 1), and both single and romantically attached men expressed less positive commitment beliefs (Study 2) following masculinity threats. Supporting a strategy of distancing from interdependence to protect masculinity, perceivers evaluated men who used more interdependent language to describe their relationships as less masculine and more feminine (Studies 3a and 3b). However, exhibiting less interdependence did not restore third-party evaluations of masculinity following a public masculinity threat (Study 3b). Thus, subverting relationship interdependence to protect perceptions of masculinity is an ineffective strategy for restoring masculinity in the eyes of others and may cause unnecessary strain on relationships.","Lamarche, Veronica M. and Atkinson, Ciara and Croft, Alyssa",0,,1619
1623,"Romantic intimacy and terror management: Examining the mediating roles of felt security, relational self-esteem, and relational worldview defense","Terror management theory posits that close relationships assuage existential mortality concerns because they foster attachment-based felt security, enhance self-esteem, and validate shared cultural worldviews. However, the relative buffering influence of these mechanisms remains relatively unknown and has sparked theoretical debate. Some theorists argue that felt security is central, whereas others suggest it does not offer unique protection from death awareness, independent of self-esteem and worldview validation. We conducted two experiments to clarify felt security's role. Testing felt security on its own, it significantly mediated the association between death awareness and increased intimacy striving (Study 1). However, when tested alongside relational self-esteem and worldview validation, felt security again exerted a significant mediating effect in parallel with relational self-esteem, although only among female participants (Study 2). These results provide initial support for the subordinate tripartite model and functional independence claim put forth in recent years. We discuss the implications of these findings.","Plusnin, Nicholas and Kashima, Emiko S. and Pepping, Christopher A.",1,,1620
1624,"Counterintuitive Effects of Individualistic Diversity Discourse on ""Generation Bataclan""","Coverage by international broadcasters and other media of the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015 made extensive use of mainstream diversity discourse to describe the victims and venues targeted by jihadists, emphasizing the unique preferences, unconventional life plans and individuality of victims. Based on sociological accounts, this paper sees that discourse as part and parcel of an individualistic ideology of diversity, which celebrates individual uniqueness and espouses relativism on the value of differences across individuals and groups. The two studies presented here address the consequences of framing the events in Paris in individual diversity ({ID}) ideological terms and question their impact on lay representations of the events and on support for antiterrorist policies by Greek university students. In Study 1, personal endorsement of {ID} ideology was associated with indirect support for strict border controls. Study 2 manipulated descriptions of victims and found that priming {ID} themes directly produced increased support for strict border controls and an increased understanding of the main symbolic target of the attacks as an assault against the West.

In Study 1, I reanalyze an existing data set on search behavior for 630 consecutive weeks and show that although illness-related search predicts religious search in 16 different countries, this association does not depend on the religiosity level of the countries. The same finding was replicated in within-nation comparisons of the U.S. states (Study 2) and Turkish provinces (Study 3). In all studies, during a period of 235 consecutive weeks, illness-related search predicted religious search, but the differences in religiosity among regions did not influence this association, which arguably might not be consistent with the terror management theory. I argue that such a finding shows the necessity of considering all alternative theories when interpreting the effects of mortality salience.","Alper, Sinan",0,,1622

1630,A traumatic dissonance theory of perpetrator-related distress,"The evolving conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) reflects ongoing debate regarding the development and manifestation of symptoms related to psychological trauma. The most recent iteration of the disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}-5) broadened Criteria A's definition of an index trauma, making possible its application to individuals experiencing symptoms related to their own act of perpetration. The current research aims to develop a theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of psychological distress resulting from perceived perpetration. It is hypothesized that unresolved dissonance relating to a violation of one's symbolic source of self-esteem and meaning (i.e., one's belief system) represents a traumatic experience that can produce significant psychological distress. This hypothesis forms the basis of the Traumatic Dissonance Scale ({TDS}), which contains three facets required to meet the criteria for a traumatic perpetrator experience: (a) the act must clearly violate one's belief system, (b) the belief system must be important to one's identity, and (c) there must be no perceived way of atoning for one's actions. Participants (N = 429) were recruited online and include subsamples of military, police, and civilian participants. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized 3-factor model, and latent profile analysis identified four respondent classes that differ in mean responses to the three {TDS} dimensions. Class membership was used as a predictor of {PTSD} symptoms, and results demonstrated that elevation on all three factors was significantly related to increased {PTSD} symptom severity compared to those in classes not reporting traumatic dissonance experiences.","Williamson, Rachel E. and Reed, David E. and Wickham, Robert E.",0,,1627

One way to protect one's worldviews is through prejudice toward worldview-dissimilar groups and individuals.

We review evidence across both political and religious domains, as well as evidence using disgust sensitivity, Big Five personality traits, and cognitive ability as measures of individual differences historically associated with prejudice. We discuss four core findings that are consistent with the worldview conflict hypothesis: (1) The link between worldview conflict and prejudice is consistent across worldviews. (2) The link between worldview conflict and prejudice is found across various expressions of prejudice. (3) The link between worldview conflict and prejudice is found in multiple countries. (4) Openness, low disgust sensitivity, and cognitive ability-traits and individual differences historically associated with less prejudice-may in fact also show evidence of worldview conflict.

1632,The effect of the normative context on intergroup discrimination: implications for the scientific value of exact and conceptual replications,"We tested the hypothesis that discriminatory behaviors against religious or ethnic minorities are largely governed by culturally specific intergroup norms that are tied to a given social context. In Study 1 (N = 733), we compared participants from five countries and identified ""new secularism"" as the culture-specific norm predominant in the target country, France. In Study 2 (N = 296) and Study 3 (N = 135) conducted in France between November 2014 and January 2016, we assessed the effects of several distinct normative contexts on discriminatory behavior under high or low time pressure, and examined for the first time, the effect of a deadly terrorist attack on anti-Muslim discrimination. As predicted based on Study 1, the experimentally induced new secularism (""nouvelle lakite"" in French) normative context had a major effect on discrimination on its own, and in interaction with the terrorist attack, whereas no effect was found for the three normative contexts (assimilation, multiculturalism, and colorblindness) that have been the focus of research in social psychology over the last 40 years. These results support the claim that intergroup behaviors are highly sensitive to variations in the social context and that culture-specific intergroup norm play a causal role in the emergence of discrimination. The implications of the findings for the scientific value of exact versus conceptual replications in social psychology are discussed.","Anier, Nolwenn and Roebroeck, Elodie and Kleinlogel, Emmanuelle P. and Badea, Constantina and Nugier, Armelle and Berthon, Mickael and Guimond, Serge",0,,1629
1633,"y The benefits of being less fixated on self and stuff: Nonattachment, reduced insecurity, and reduced materialism","Materialism has often been considered as a means of attaining a more positive sense of self within a consumer culture. In two undergraduate samples (N = 248, 183), the current study assessed the extent to which various forms of insecurity (i.e., low self-esteem, public self-consciousness, relative deprivation, anxious attachment, fear of death) mediate the relationship between the Buddhist construct of nonattachment and materialism. In line with expectations, greater nonattachment was directly associated with reduced materialism in both samples. Nonattachment was also found to be indirectly associated with reduced materialism via reduced public self-consciousness and relative deprivation. Self-esteem, anxious attachment, and fear of death did not mediate the relationship between nonattachment and materialism. The findings therefore indicate that the acceptance and non-contingent sense of self typical of nonattachment may play an important role in minimising the experience or impact of insecurity that can contribute to materialism, as well as minimising the importance placed on material goals.","Elphinstone, Brad and Whitehead, Richard",1,,1630

We tested whether the facets of meaning mediated these functions. Method All studies measured {RWA} and meaning in life ({MIL}). Study 1, N = 2,319, also measured covariates, including Protestant Work Ethic and religiosity. Study 2, N = 505, examined {RWA} and meaning facets (purpose, coherence, and significance), and measured religiosity. Study 3, N = 971, measured psychological distress to test the existential buffering function of {RWA}. Study 4, N = 833, tested this hypothesis using meaning facets and tested for moderated mediation. Results In all studies, {RWA} and {MIL} were positively correlated. In Study 1, Protestant Work Ethic and religiosity weakened this association. In Study 2, significance mediated the association between {RWA} and global {MIL}. Religiosity wiped out the relationship between {RWA} and meaning variables, except significance. Study 3 supported the existential buffering hypothesis: distress and global {MIL} were less strongly related among those high on {RWA}. Study 4 replicated this finding for {MIL} facets.

Furthermore, the association between control and stereotyping was mediated by need for structure (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3).

Two further (pre-registered) studies were conducted to test this idea. Mortality salience effects in Study 2 (N = 615) were not significant. However, using an improved experimental procedure in Study 3 (N = 600), heroic perceptions were indeed significantly less positive under {MS}, especially for participants with low trait self-esteem and low social comparison orientation.","Schindler, Simon and Pfattheicher, Stefan and Reinhard, Marc-Andre and Greenberg, Jeff",1,,1633

1638,Retaliation against the outgroup: The role of self-uncertainty,"Outgroups who threaten the core aspects of one's identity, such as one's social group and its values, may make group members feel self-uncertain. Because past research associates uncertainty with defensive behavior, we propose that self-uncertainty will drive aggressive retaliation against a threatening outgroup. Two experiments tested the role of self-uncertainty in retaliation motivation. In Experiment 1, university students were threatened by their school rival and then reported self-uncertainty and willingness to retaliate. The threat evoked anger and caused male group members to feel significantly more self-uncertain, which was associated with significantly greater retaliation motivation. In Experiment 2, we manipulated Americans' feelings of self-uncertainty and threat from a terrorist group, {ISIS}. Uncertain males were significantly more willing to retaliate against {ISIS} after threats that caused anger and fear.

These scenarios may be popular because people have their own beliefs and visions about the apocalypse and the need to prepare. The prevalence of such beliefs might also hold societal relevance and serve as a type of projective test of personality. However, there are no quantitative accounts of post-apocalyptic or prepping beliefs. As such, we conducted seven studies (N-total = 1034) to do so. In Studies 1 and 2, we developed a post-apocalyptic and prepping beliefs scale, explored its correlates, and confirmed its structure and psychometric properties. In Study 3, we attempted to activate a 'prepper' mindset and further explore the correlates of the new scale. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigated covariations in daily feelings, thoughts, and events, and prepping beliefs. In Studies 6a and 6b, we compared scores from 'real' preppers and to a non-prepping group. Overall, we found that post-apocalyptic concerns and prepping beliefs are predictive of low agreeableness and humility, paranoia, cynicism, conspiracy mentality, conservatism, and social dominance orientation. We also found that increased belief in the need to prep is associated with God-belief, negative daily experiences, and global political events.

1640,Is there a place in politics for compassion? The role of compassion in predicting hierarchy-legitimizing views,"Political beliefs underlie behaviors including voting and participation in collective resistance. Hierarchy-legitimizing beliefs can justify and perpetuate extant social hierarchies, such as economic inequality. Individual differences are important predictors of many political beliefs, but the role of compassion in this context has not been explored. This study investigated the relationship between dispositional compassion, which has shown promise in predicting enhanced prosociality, with hierarchy-legitimizing viewpoints, mediated by social dominance orientation ({SDO}). A sample of 590 undergraduate students completed measures of compassion, empathy, {SDO}, and sociopolitical policy views. Structural equation modeling showed that {SDO} mediated the relationship between compassion and hierarchy legitimization. The findings have implications for compassion's relevance in political psychology, and for expanding understanding of the antecedents of anti-egalitarianism.","Sinclair, Vanessa M. and Saklofske, Donald H.",0,,1637
1641,Various forms of existential distress are associated with aggressive tendencies,"We propose that aggressive tendencies are more (vs. less) pronounced among people who frequently (vs. less frequently) experience challenges to their perceived meaning in life. We tested this hypothesis for three different forms of existential distress: loneliness, boredom, and disillusionment. The results of Study 1 confirm that loneliness is associated with aggressive tendencies and that this positive association can be partly attributed to the search for meaning that comes with loneliness. The results of Study 2 indicate that meaning search plays a similar role in the relationship between boredom proneness and aggressive tendencies. Finally, the results of Study 3 indicate that the more often people feel disillusioned, the more pronounced their aggressive tendencies are, and this association is again partly attributable to meaning search. These findings suggest that aggressive tendencies have roots in existential distress and in the motivation to find meaning in life.","van Tilburg, Wijn and A.

1642,Lost in the crowd: Conformity as escape following disbelief in free will,"Belief in free will is founded on the idea that people are responsible for their behavior. People who believe in free will derive meaning in life from these beliefs. Conformity refers to succumbing to external pressures and imitating others' behaviors. Sometimes, conformity involves a loss of self-awareness, which reduces perceived meaninglessness. We tested if disbelief in free will increases perceived meaninglessness and if people subsequently become more conformist to address this negative existential perception. We conducted three studies to test this hypothesis. In Study 1, experimentally induced disbelief in free will resulted in perceived meaninglessness. In Study 2, perceived meaninglessness correlated with conformity. Finally, in Study 3, perceived meaninglessness mediated the relationship between disbelief in free will and conformity, especially under high self-awareness. We conclude that perceptions about meaning play a central role in the relationship between disbelief in free will and conformity.","Moynihan, Andrew B. and Igou, Eric R. and van Tilburg, Wijn and A.

1643,Fear of death mediates ostracism distress and the moderating role of attachment internal working models,"Ostracism is known to cause psychological distress; however, it remains unclear why ostracism evokes this response. Two experiments tested empirically whether fear of death mediates ostracism effects and whether attachment internal working models moderate this role. A total of 288 participants played Cyberball with two other ostensible players. After the game the accessibility of their death-related thoughts was assessed by a word completion task, and the Needs Satisfaction Scale was used to measure their distress. Participants' attachment orientation was measured using the Experiences in Close Relationship scale. Death anxiety fully mediated ostracism distress. However, this effect was stronger in low-anxiety individuals. These studies contribute to the ostracism literature by providing further empirical support that death anxiety mediates ostracism distress, and to the attachment literature by documenting the moderation effect of attachment anxiety.","Yaakobi, Erez",1,,1640
1646,Responding to natural disasters: Examining identity and prosociality in the context of a major earthquake,"How does a major natural disaster relate to individuals' orientation towards society? We collected repeated cross-sectional surveys before (n = 644) and after the 2010 Chile earthquake (n = 1,389) to examine levels of national identity, prosocial values, helping motivations, and prosocial behaviours in the context of such a calamitous societal event. Our research questions, derived from the literature on helping in times of crisis, considered how natural disasters may implicate identity and prosociality, as well as how identity, prosocial values, and motivations are linked to prosocial action after a disaster. Higher levels of national identity, helping motivations, and disaster-related helping were found after the earthquake, suggesting that in the aftermath of a disaster, people unite under a common national identity and are motivated to take action related to disaster relief. National identity and prosocial values were closely linked to helping after the earthquake, but specific helping motivations rarely predicted prosocial behaviours. Additionally, proximity to the epicentre was related to higher levels of national identity and participation in reconstruction efforts. These findings contribute to our understanding of people's responses to natural disasters and suggest ways of encouraging prosocial behaviour in the aftermath of unexpected tragic events.","Maki, Alex and er and Dwyer, Patrick C. and Blazek, Susanne and Snyder, Mark and Gonzalez, Roberto and Lay, Siugmin",0,,1641
1647,Liberals Possess More National Consensus on Political Attitudes in the United States: An Examination Across 40 Years,"Do liberals or conservatives have more agreement in their political attitudes? Recent research indicates that conservatives may have more like-minded social groups than do liberals, but whether conservatives have more consensus on a broad, national level remains an open question. Using two nationally representative data sets (the General Social Survey and the American National Election Studies), we examined the attitudes of over 80,000 people on more than 400 political issues (e.g., attitudes toward welfare, gun control, same-sex marriage) across approximately 40 years. In both data sets, we found that liberals possessed a larger degree of agreement in their political attitudes than did conservatives. Additionally, both liberals and conservatives possessed more consensus than did political moderates. These results indicate that social-cognitive motivations for building similarity and consensus within one's self-created social groups may also yield less consensus on a broad, national level. We discuss implications for effective political mobilization and social change.","Ondish, Peter and Stern, Chadly",0,,1642
1648,Mood and the Perception of Sexual Interest in Different Cultural Contexts: A Comparison Between a Malaysian and a Swiss Sample,"The current study examined, on the basis of past findings and theories on mood and cognition, whether people's perception of sexual interest from others would decrease when they are in a negative mood and increase when they are in a positive mood. Using repeated-measures experiments, university students in Switzerland (n = 117) and Malaysia (n = 117) underwent mood inducement procedures followed by participation in video-guided imagined interactions, where they judged the sexual interest of their interaction partners. Results revealed a dampening effect of negative mood on sexual perceptions in the Swiss sample. No significant mood differences in sexual perception were found in the Malaysian sample. Our results suggest that this sample difference may be associated with differences in endorsement of cultural values. The more people valued social harmony and stability, the less likely they were to succumb to mood effects on sexual perception.","Goh, Pei Hwa and Stoeckli, Peter Lucas and Schoebi, Dominik",0,,1643
1649,The populist effect: Threat and the handover of freedom,"People universally value autonomy, and this is the case particularly in individualist societies. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that even in the {US}, an individualist society, people are willing to relinquish personal control and choose to be an amorphous entity in a behaviorally homogeneous group when under physical threat because such groups increase the effectiveness in mobilizing collective effort. We found evidence for this hypothesis in two studies. In Study 1, individual differences in perceived physical threat (but not social threat) predicted the preference for joining a homogeneous group, through the mediating effect of lowered endorsement of personal agency. We replicated this result in Study 2, in which the cognitive salience of physical and social threat was experimentally manipulated. We discuss the implications of these results.","Bettache, Karim and Chiu, Chi-yue",0,,1644
1650,"To Be Immortal, Do Good or Evil","Many people believe in immortality, but who is perceived to live on and how exactly do they live on? Seven studies reveal that good- and evil-doers are perceived to possess more immortalityalbeit different kinds. Good-doers have transcendent immortality, with their souls persisting beyond space and time; evil-doers have trapped immortality, with their souls persisting on Earth, bound to a physical location. Studies 1 to 4 reveal bidirectional links between perceptions of morality and type of immortality. Studies 5 to 7 reveal how these links explain paranormal perceptions. People generally tie paranormal events to evil spirits (Study 5), but this depends upon location: Evil spirits are perceived to haunt houses and dense forests, whereas good spirits are perceived in expansive locations such as mountaintops (Study 6). However, even good spirits may be seen as trapped on Earth given extenuating circumstances (Study 7). Materials include a scale for measuring trapped and transcendent immorality.","Gray, Kurt and Anderson, Stephen and Doyle, Cameron M. and Hester, Neil and Schmitt, Peter and Vonasch, Andrew J. and Allison, Scott T. and Jackson, Joshua C.",0,,1645
1651,A microscopic dot on a microscopic dot: Self-esteem buffers the negative effects of exposure to the enormity of the universe,"Although our planet feels indescribably large, in the context of the universe it is infinitesimally small. For some, the feeling of smallness associated with being reminded of the vastness of the universe might represent a psychological threat. For others, it could be a self-transcendent experience, helping them rise above self-focused concerns and to feel a sense of oneness with others. In two studies (Ns = 294 and 409) we exposed people to videos that did or did not depict the enormity of the universe. Compared to a control condition, low self-esteem people exposed to the vastness of the universe reported more negative affect, less identification with others, less empathy to victims of a humanitarian disaster, and lower egalitarianism. This effect was not found for high self-esteem respondents. Results are discussed with reference to research on awe and the small self.","Hornsey, Matthew J. and Faulkner, Callum and Crimston, Daniel and Moreton, Sam",0,,1646
1652,In the aftermath of terrorism: Effects of self versus group affirmation on support for discriminatory policies,"An experiment conducted with 240 French undergraduates examined the effectiveness of self-affirmation and group-affirmation procedures for diminishing perceived threat and support for discriminatory policy shortly after terrorist attacks in Paris. (Two pilot studies tested the affirmation procedures before the attacks). We hypothesized that affirmations that are congruent with dominant modes of self-definition should be more effective than incongruent affirmations. That is, we predicted that the self-affirmation manipulation should be most effective at reducing prejudice among people high in individualism, whereas the group-affirmation manipulation may be most effective among people high in collectivism. Results only supported the former hypothesis. The self-affirmation procedure effectively reduced perceptions of threat and support for discriminatory policies among those high in individualism, but the group affirmation had no consistent effects, either among those high in collectivism or otherwise. The findings suggest important practical and theoretical differences in the vulnerabilities of self and social identities in the aftermath of terrorism.","Badea, Constantina and Binning, Kevin and Verlhiac, Jean-Francois and Sherman, David K.",1,,1647
1653,Anxious attachment and belief in conspiracy theories,"This research examined the link between attachment styles and belief in conspiracy theories. It was hypothesized, due to the tendency to exaggerate the intensity of threats, that higher anxiously attached individuals would be more likely to hold conspiracy beliefs, even when accounting for other variables such as right-wing authoritarianism, interpersonal trust, and demographic factors that have been found to predict conspiracy belief in previous research. In Study 1 (N = 246 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers), participants higher in anxious attachment style showed a greater tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. Further, this relationship remained significant when accounting for other known predictors of conspiracy belief. Study 2 (N = 230 Prolific Academic workers) revealed that anxious attachment again predicted the general tendency to believe conspiracy theories, but also belief in specific conspiracy theories and conspiracy theories about groups. These relationships held when controlling for demographic factors. The current studies add to the body of research investigating the individual differences predictors of conspiracy belief, demonstrating that conspiracy belief may, to some degree, have roots in early childhood experiences.","Green, Ricky and Douglas, Karen M.",0,,1648
1654,Closing ranks: Ingroup norm conformity as a subtle response to threatening climate change,"We tested the hypothesis that climate change threat increases group-based cognition and action tendencies. As ingroups can provide extended primary control, we expected climate change threat to increase conformity with ingroup norms and group protective behavior. In three studies (N = 404), we experimentally manipulated climate change threat (Studies 1-3) and group norm content (Studies 2 and 3). We found that participants under climate change threat more strongly derogated group members who acted against the group's interests (Study 1). When a specific group norm was made salient, both manipulated (Study 3) and perceived climate change threat (Studies 2 and 3) increased ingroup norm conformity. Importantly, this effect occurred for norms of radical left-wing behavior. This suggests that climate change threat does not necessarily induce a conservative shift. Instead, it elicits group-based defenses whose expression depends on which ingroup and which of its norms are salient.","Barth, Markus and Masson, Torsten and Fritsche, Immo and Ziemer, Carolin-T.",0,,1649
1655,Romantic love versus reproduction opportunities: Disentangling the contributions of different anxiety buffers under conditions of existential threat,"Romantic relationships and offspring are discussed as anxiety buffers in terror management processes. We examined the relationship between these possible buffers and tested whether romantic relationships reduce existential threat due to reproduction opportunities or if they represent a distinct anxiety buffer. Contrary to our initial expectations, thinking about a positive romantic relationship without (vs. with) own children increased partner affect (Study 1) and commitment (Study 2) and decreased punishment intentions (Study 2) after mortality salience. These effects were mediated by participants' desire for romantic love. Furthermore, thinking about positive nonparental (vs. parental) romantic relationships lowered death-thought accessibility (Study 3). Together, these findings suggest that romantic relationships form a distinct anxiety buffer that is only effective when the cultural (romance) instead of the biological (having children) nature of the relationship is highlighted. We discuss the role of anxiety buffer salience for determining whether offspring concerns buffer or increase existential threat.","Hoppe, Annedore and Fritsche, Immo and Koranyi, Nicolas",1,,1650

Whereas some put their faith in science, others routinely reject and dismiss scientific evidence. This chapter provides an integration of recent research on how people evaluate science. We organize our chapter along three research topics that are most relevant to this goal: ideology, motivation, and morality. We review the relations of political and religious ideologies to science attitudes, discuss the psychological functions and motivational underpinnings of belief in science, and describe work looking at the role of morality when evaluating science and scientists. In the final part of the chapter, we apply what we know about science evaluations to the current crisis of faith in science and the open science movement. Here, we also take into account the increased accessibility and popularization of science and the (perceived) relations between science and industry.","Rutjens, Bastiaan T. and Heine, Steven J. and Sutton, Robbie M. and van Harreveld, Frenk",0,,1651
1657,"What Makes Moral Disgust Special? An Integrative Functional Review - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 57","The role of disgust in moral psychology has been a matter of much controversy and experimentation over the past 20 or so years. We present here an integrative look at the literature, organized according to the four functions of emotion proposed by integrative functional theory: appraisal, associative, self-regulation, and communicative. Regarding appraisals, we review experimental, personality, and neuroscientific work that has shown differences between elicitors of disgust and anger in moral contexts, with disgust responding more to bodily moral violations such as incest, and anger responding more to sociomoral violations such as theft. We also present new evidence for interpreting the phenomenon of sociomoral disgust as an appraisal of bad character in a person. The associative nature of disgust is shown by evidence for ""unreasoning disgust,"" in which associations to bodily moral violations are not accompanied by elaborated reasons, and not modified by appraisals such as harm or intent. We also critically examine the literature about the ability of incidental disgust to intensify moral judgments associatively. For disgust's self-regulation function, we consider the possibility that disgust serves as an existential defense, regulating avoidance of thoughts that might threaten our basic self-image as living humans. Finally, we discuss new evidence from our lab that moral disgust serves a communicative function, implying that expressions of disgust serve to signal one's own moral intentions even when a different emotion is felt internally on the basis of appraisal. Within the scope of the literature, there is evidence that all four functions of Giner-Sorolla's (2012) integrative functional theory of emotion may be operating, and that their variety can help explain some of the paradoxes of disgust.","Giner-Sorolla, Roger and Kupfer, Tom and Sabo, John",0,,1652

Games are a unique and powerful method: They are engaging and have the potential to both manipulate and measure psychological constructs. In fact, researchers have used physical games, board games, behavioral economics games, and digital games to study a range of individual differences, interpersonal processes, and social cognitive processes. Furthermore, researchers have the opportunity to create their own games that can be targeted directly toward their topic of interest. Our review provides a primer for social and personality psychologists interested in using existing games or creating new games for their research as a method for understanding attitudes, behaviors, emotions, cognitions, and perceptions.","Freedman, Gili and Flanagan, Mary",0,,1653
1659,The threat of racial progress and the self-protective nature of perceiving anti-White bias,"In two studies we tested whether racial progress is threatening to Whites and whether perceiving anti-White bias assuages that threat. Study 1 revealed that Whites primed with racial progress exhibited evidence of threat (lower implicit self-worth relative to baseline). Study 2 replicated the threat effect from Study 1 and examined how perceiving discrimination may buffer Whites' self-worth. After White participants primed with high racial progress attributed a negative event to their race, their implicit self-worth rebounded. Participants primed to perceive low racial progress did not experience fluctuations in implicit self-worth. Furthermore, among those primed with high racial progress, greater racial discounting (attributing rejection to race rather than to the self) was associated with greater self-worth protection. These studies suggest that changes to the racial status quo are threatening to Whites and that perceiving greater racial bias is a way to manage that threat.","Wilkins, Clara L. and Hirsch, Alex and er A. and Kaiser, Cheryl R. and Inkles, Michael P.",0,,1654
1660,Quest for Significance and Violent Extremism: The Case of Domestic Radicalization,"In the present study, we applied the quest for significance model of radicalization to explain the use of political violence. According to the model, when people experience loss of personal significance (e.g., due to social rejection, achievement failures, or abuse) the motivation to restore significance may push them toward the use of extreme means. We tested this prediction in a sample of individuals who have committed ideologically motivated crimes in the United States (n=1496). We found that experiences of economic and social loss of significance were separate and positive predictors related to the use of violence by perpetrators of ideologically motivated crimes. We also found evidence that the presence of radicalized others (friends but not family members) in the individuals' social network increased their likelihood of using violence.","Jasko, Katarzyna and {LaFree}, Gary and Kruglanski, Arie",0,,1655
1661,5 Who am I if I am not like my group? Self-uncertainty and feeling peripheral in a group,"Being a fringe-group (peripheral) member in one's group can cause individual pain (e.g., depression) and societal damage (e.g., violence). Whereas most research on feeling peripheral focuses on how the experience interrupts people's sense of belonging and increases ingroup bias, the present research explores why feeling different from the ingroup increases belonging needs. Building on uncertainty-identity theory, we propose that self-uncertainty results from not feeling prototypical and creates a motivational drive to increase ingroup behaviors. Three experiments support these hypotheses. Experiment 1 (N = 152) established that feeling peripheral elevates self uncertainty. Experiment 2 (N = 77) demonstrated that feeling peripheral leads to increased group identification only for those who are self-uncertain and Experiment 3 (N = 319) showed that it leads to ingroup bias only for those who are self-uncertain. Overall, these findings demonstrate that feeling peripheral produces self uncertainty, which leads people to engage in ingroup behaviors.","Hohman, Zachary P. and Gaffney, Amber M. and Hogg, Michael A.",0,,1656
1662,Experienced Adversity in Life Is Associated With Polarized and Affirmed Political Attitudes,"Many studies find that when made to feel uncertain, participants respond by affirming importantly held beliefs. However, while theories argue that these effects should persist over time for highly disruptive experiences, almost no research has been performed outside the lab. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a national sample of U.S. adults (N = 1,613) who were followed longitudinally for 3 years. Participants reported lifetime and recent adversities experienced annually, as well as their opinions on a number of questions related to intergroup hostility and aggression toward out-groups, similar to those used in many lab studies of uncertainty. We anticipated that those who had experienced adversity would show more extreme support for their position. There was a positive relationship between adversity and the tendency to strongly affirm and polarize their positions. Results suggest that adverse life events may lead to long-lasting changes in one's tendency to polarize one's political attitudes.","R and les, Daniel and Heine, Steven J. and Poulin, Michael and Silver, Roxane Cohen",0,,1657

To distinguish this mechanism from possible conservative shift we investigated liberal norms (i.e., change and anti right-wing norms). In a field experiment (N = 82), salient personal control increased managers' commitment to organizational change under conditions of a pro-change in-group norm. Two laboratory experiments showed control threat to heighten students' support for educational innovations when salient in-group norms were supportive, but not when they were ambivalent (N = 152), or when only out-group norms were supportive (N = 170). Applying this logic, perceived terrorist threat after a major attack predicted German students' intention to support anti right-wing protests for those who perceived a strong anti right-wing norm among students (N = 74). We discuss implications for both theory and societal polarization (instead of conservative shift) in times of threatened control.","Stollberg, Janine and Fritsche, Immo and Jonas, Eva",0,,1658

In this review, I argue that there is a kernel of truth to these perspectives, but that they each define both ""threat"" and ""conservatism"" too broadly. I review evidence supporting a Compensatory Political Behavior ({CPB}) Model, which posits that whereas liberals and conservatives are similarly influenced by and responsive to meaning threats, conservatives, and in particular social conservatives, are differentially influenced by and responsive to physical threats. The {CPB} model suggests that whereas some political beliefs are more deeply rooted in psychological predispositions, others reflect more surface-based ideological motives. I conclude with suggestions for future research to test the model's predictions regarding the relationship between threat and political ideology.","Crawford, Jarret T.",0,,1659
1665,When criticism is ineffective: The case of historical trauma and unsupportive allies,"Three studies examined the effect of historical trauma reminders and criticism from international allies on attitudes toward current conflicts. In Study 1, Israeli participants (N= 116) were primed with the Holocaust, and read either that the U.S. President Obama supports Israel's right to defend itself and attack Iran, or that he opposes such action. Then, support for preemptive violence was assessed. Study 2 (N= 133) replicated this design, comparing inclusive and exclusive framings of the Holocaust. Study 3 (N= 478), examined the effect of Holocaust reminders and criticism from the European Union on attitudes toward militant policies against Palestinians. All three studies found that Holocaust primes juxtaposed with international criticism increased support for aggression, especially under exclusive framings of the Holocaust. Study 3, however, found this effect only among left-wing participants. These findings indicate that when historical trauma is salient, international criticism may be ineffective and may even backfire.","Hirschberger, Gilad and Lifshin, Uri and Seeman, Stephanie and Ein-Dor, Tsachi and Pyszczynski, Tom",0,,1660

In Study 1, we experimentally establish that the motive to find meaning in life increases {ETI} beliefs. In Study 2, we replicate previous research demonstrating that low religiosity is associated with greater {ETI} beliefs. In Studies 3-4 we tested and found support for a model linking low religiosity to low presence of meaning, high search for meaning, and greater {ETI} beliefs.

1667,Ideological Asymmetries and the Essence of Political Psychology,"Individuals are not merely passive vessels of whatever beliefs and opinions they have been exposed to; rather, they are attracted to belief systems that resonate with their own psychological needs and interests, including epistemic, existential, and relational needs to attain certainty, security, and social belongingness. Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003) demonstrated that needs to manage uncertainty and threat were associated with core values of political conservatism, namely respect for tradition and acceptance of inequality. Since 2003 there have been far more studies on the psychology of left-right ideology than in the preceding half century, and their empirical yield helps to address lingering questions and criticisms. We have identified 181 studies of epistemic motivation (involving 130,000 individual participants) and nearly 100 studies of existential motivation (involving 360,000 participants). These databases, which are much larger and more heterogeneous than those used in previous meta-analyses, confirm that significant ideological asymmetries exist with respect to dogmatism, cognitive/perceptual rigidity, personal needs for order/structure/closure, integrative complexity, tolerance of ambiguity/uncertainty, need for cognition, cognitive reflection, self-deception, and subjective perceptions of threat. Exposure to objectively threatening circumstances-such as terrorist attacks, governmental warnings, and shifts in racial demography-contribute to modest ""conservative shifts"" in public opinion. There are also ideological asymmetries in relational motivation, including the desire to share reality, perceptions of within-group consensus, collective self-efficacy, homogeneity of social networks, and the tendency to trust the government more when one's own political party is in power. Although some object to the very notion that there are meaningful psychological differences between leftists and rightists, the identification of ""elective affinities"" between cognitive-motivational processes and contents of specific belief systems is essential to the study of political psychology. Political psychologists may contribute to the development of a good society not by downplaying ideological differences or advocating ""Swiss-style neutrality"" when it comes to human values, but by investigating such phenomena critically, even-or perhaps especially-when there is pressure in society to view them uncritically.","Jost, John T.",0,,1662
1668,A prisoner of one's own mind: Identifying and understanding existential isolation,"Although often treated as a singular construct, social isolation can assume an interpersonal or an existential form (Yalom, 1980). Here we develop an individual difference measure of existential isolation, or, isolation with regard to one's experience of reality (Pinel, Long, Landau, \& Pyszczynski, 2004; Yalom, 1980). We detail the validation of the Existential Isolation Scale and provide evidence of its convergent, discriminant, and criterion validities (Studies 1 and 2). In addition, we show that levels of existential isolation remain stable over a two-week period (Study 3), but also change as expected among those primed with the construct (Study 3). In the discussion, we review research that further establishes the uniqueness of this construct and its relevance to understanding the causes and consequences associated with social isolation more broadly construed.

Other models argue that not all forms of meaning are created equal; certain forms of striving trump other ones. This review compares the assertions made by these different models related to meaning to illustrate that (a) with few exceptions, fluidity is central to meaning, and (b) despite such consensus on the fluid nature of meaning, existing models diverge on the existence and nature of ""ultimate"" meanings.

The study explored the impact of the three self-motives on adherence to {LAD} beliefs through three mediators: self-esteem, feelings of disquiet, and thoughts-accessibility (thoughts of death, need-for-control, and uncertainty). Participants were randomly assigned to write about their own death, a time they felt uncertain, a time they felt powerless, or about a toothache episode. The mediators (accessibility of disturbing thoughts, feelings of disquiet-uncertainty, and self-esteem) were measured next. The dependent variable selected was endorsement of {LAD} beliefs. Results showed that the cognitive and emotional responses produced by the activation of the three motives were similar. The three motives increased the accessibility of uncertain-related thoughts that, in turn, increased the adherence to {LAD}.","Echebarria Echabe, Agustin and Perez, Saioa",1,,1665
1672,Can boredom help? Increased prosocial intentions in response to boredom,"Boredom is typically regarded a nuisance. Past research on boredom depicts this common emotion as a correlate of many detrimental psychological and social factors, including addiction, depression, discrimination, and aggression. We present a more nuanced perspective on boredom. Specifically, we propose and test that state boredom serves an important self-regulatory function with the potential to foster positive interpersonal consequences: It signals a lack of purpose in activity and fosters a search for meaningful engagement. We examined whether boredom can subsequently cause prosocial intentions if the corresponding prosocial behavior is seen as purposeful. As predicted, boredom, which is characterized by a search for meaning (pilot study), promoted prosocial intentions (Experiment 1), in particular when the corresponding behavior was seen as highly meaningful (Experiment 2). Our novel findings suggest that boredom can have desirable consequences and recasts this emotion as not merely good or bad but rather as personally and socially functional.","van Tilburg, Wijn and A.

1673,"The Motivational Underpinnings of Belief in God - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 56","Beliefs in powerful Gods are prevalent across time and across societies. In this chapter, we explore the motivated underpinnings of this phenomenon. After describing two popular theories that help account for some of this prevalence-one focused on byproducts of normal human cognition and the other focused on the cultural benefit conferred by shared belief in powerful Gods-we propose that a third perspective may be needed to fully explain why so many people believe: that believing in God is one mechanism through which people fulfill their need to perceive the world as structured, orderly, and nonrandom. We then describe a model that outlines the causes and consequences of perceptions of structure, and leverage this model to organize the evidence connecting belief in God to people's need for structure. We then note the ways in which belief in a powerful God, though not the only form of belief that can satisfy the need for structure, may hold an advantage over most alternatives. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of this perspective for understanding the ongoing evolution of religious belief.","Laurin, Kristin and Kay, Aaron C.",0,,1667
1674,How Moral Threat Shapes Laypersons' Engagement With Science,"Laypersons' engagement with science has grown over the last decade, especially in Internet environments. While this development has many benefits, scientists also face the challenge of devaluation and public criticism by laypersons. Embedding this phenomenon in social-psychological theories and research on value-behavior correspondence, we investigated moral threat as a factor influencing laypersons' engagement with science. Across three studies, we hypothesized and found that moral values shape the way laypersons evaluate and communicate about science when these values are threatened in a given situation and central to people's self-concept. However, prior research on the underlying mechanism of moral threat effects cannot fully rule out value salience as an alternative explanation. To close this gap, we situationally induced value salience while varying the degree of moral threat (Study 3). Our findings indicate that moral threat amplifies the influence of moral values on laypersons' evaluation of science above and beyond value salience.","Bender, Jens and Rothmund, Tobias and Nauroth, Peter and Gollwitzer, Mario",0,,1668
1675,Going to political extremes in response to boredom,"Boredom makes people attempt to re-establish a sense of meaningfulness. Political ideologies, and in particular the adherence to left-versus right-wing beliefs, can serve as a source of meaning. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that boredom is associated with a stronger adherence to left-versus right-wing beliefs, resulting in more extreme political orientations. Study 1 demonstrates that experimentally induced boredom leads to more extreme political orientations. Study 2 indicates that people who become easily bored with their environment adhere to more extreme ends of a political spectrum compared with their less easily bored counterparts. Finally, Study 3 reveals that the relatively extreme political orientations among those who are easily bored can be attributed to their enhanced search for meaning. Overall, our research suggests that extreme political orientations are, in part, a function of boredom's existential qualities.","Van Tilburg, Wijn and A. P. and Igou, Eric R.",0,,1669
1676,"Meaning threat can promote peaceful, not only military-based approaches to intergroup conflict: The moderating role of ingroup glorification","Most research on threat documents its negative consequences. Similarly, most research on intergroup contexts has emphasized their negative behavioral effects. Drawing on the Meaning Maintenance Model and recent perspectives on the potential for positivity in intergroup conflict, we predicted that meaning threat can produce both antisocial and prosocial responses to intergroup conflict, depending on people's preexisting meaning frameworks. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that under meaning threat, low ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for peaceful conflict resolution, whereas high ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for military-based conflict resolution. In the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Study 3 found that low glorification was associated with greater support for peace during ""hot"" (but not ""cold"") conflict, because hot conflict reduced their meaning in life. These findings are consistent with the notion that when meaning is threatened, people affirm their preexisting values-whether prosocial or antisocial-even in the context of intergroup conflict.","Rovenpor, Daniel R. and Leidner, Bernhard and Kardos, Peter and O'Brien, Thomas C.",0,,1670
1677,The closing of open minds: Need for closure moderates the impact of uncertainty salience on outgroup discrimination,"In three studies, we examined how dispositional need for cognitive closure ({NCC}) moderates the impact of various types of uncertainty salience (personal and supraliminal in studies 1 and 2; economic and subliminal in Study 3) on implicit attitudes (studies 1 and 3) and explicit discriminatory intentions (Study 2) towards outgroup members. Across all three studies, we found that uncertainty increased discrimination against outgroups among low-{NCC} individuals but not among high-{NCC} individuals. High-{NCC} individuals tended to be more discriminatory irrespective of uncertainty salience. These results suggest that uncertainty salience leads individuals with a low dispositional need for closure to act like those with high need for closure. The implications of the findings for theories about how uncertainty influences social attitudes and intergroup behaviour are discussed.","Brizi, Ambra and Mannetti, Lucia and Kruglanski, Arie W.",0,,1671
1678,From Dispositions to Goals to Ideology: Toward a Synthesis of Personality and Social Psychological Approaches to Political Orientation,"We review existing research on the associations between political orientation and Big Five traits such as Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness. We suggest that analyzing these traits at the aspect level sheds light on motivational mechanisms underlying these links. For example, we present evidence that only one of the two aspects of Conscientiousness (Orderliness) reliably predicts conservatism. To account for this relationship, and to more generally describe how traits translate into political orientation, we present a new model, the Disposition-Goals-Ideology ({DiGI}) Model. The {DiGI} model outlines specific interrelationships among dispositions, goals, and ideological beliefs that help to shape individual differences in political orientation.","Xu, Xiaowen and Plaks, Jason E. and Peterson, Jordan B.",0,,1672
1679,Sometimes inclusion breeds suspicion: Self-uncertainty and belongingness predict belief in conspiracy theories,"In the present contribution, the author investigated the idea that messages communicating inclusion by others lead to stronger conspiracy beliefs about impactful societal events than messages communicating exclusion by others. These effects of belongingness, however, were expected only among people who experience high levels of self-uncertainty. In Study 1, a manipulation of belongingness predicted belief in conspiracy theories only among people with unstable self-esteem (an individual difference indicator of self-uncertainty), while controlling for self-esteem level. In Study 2, a manipulation of belongingness influenced belief in conspiracy theories only among participants who were experimentally induced to feel uncertain about themselves. It is concluded that among self-uncertain people, inclusion breeds suspicion about the causes of impactful and harmful societal events.","van Prooijen, Jan-Willem",0,,1673
1680,Fluid compensation following threats to self-concept clarity,"We examined defensive responses to self-clarity threats, finding that self-uncertain participants gave larger rewards to a social hero, but larger punishments to a social transgressor, than self-certain participants (Study 1). To examine whether there are individual differences in defensiveness to meaning threats, we included moderators, showing that high self-esteem individuals ({HSE}) thinking about self-inconsistencies gave more polarized evaluations of someone criticizing vs. complimenting their ingroup than self-consistent {HSEs} (Study 2). We found similar responses to a relational self-clarity threat, among individuals for whom relationships are self-defining (Study 3). Results held controlling for the impact of the self-clarity manipulations on self-esteem. This research is compatible with the meaning maintenance model, which stipulates that various meaning threats elicit fluid compensatory efforts designed to restore general feelings of meaningfulness. We discuss limitations and future directions.","Boucher, Helen C. and Bloch, Thomas and Pelletier, Addie",0,,1674
1681,{MORALIZATION} {AND} {INTOLERANCE} {OF} {IDEOLOGICAL} {OUTGROUPS},"Moral conflicts are pervasive and potentially corrosive to democratic politics; however, little is known about where moral convictions come from. We review evidence for the role of emotions, beliefs, and the self-concept, in predicting moralization. To the extent that moral convictions are emotionally relevant, tightly intertwined with the self, and, in some cases, associated with harms and benefits may help to explain their potency in predicting political behaviors and perceptions. In support of this idea we review recent work suggesting that both political liberals and conservatives are equally intolerant toward ideological outgroups and that this intolerance is often based on perceived moral and value differences. Neither liberals nor conservatives are uniquely (im)moral, but rather both seek to defend the meaning provided by their political beliefs that are connected to their fundamental moral beliefs. Possible solutions to reduce moral conflict and promote cooperation are discussed.","Br and t, Mark J. and Wetherell, Geoffrey and Crawford, Jarret T.",0,,1675
1682,It's the End of the World and I Feel Fine: Soul Belief and Perceptions of End-of-the-World Scenarios,"Five studies tested the effects that soul beliefs have on reactions to end-of-the-world scenarios. In Studies 1 and 2, participants who firmly believe in an immortal soul showed less resistance to an article predicting the end of humanity than those without such belief. However, in Studies 3 to 5, thoughts of symbolic immortality made soul believers more resistant to scientific evidence predicting the end of humanity. These results suggest that belief in an immortal soul provides psychological protection against the threat of humanity's demise that does not hold for symbolic immortality beliefs.","Lifshin, Uri and Greenberg, Jeff and Weise, David and Soenke, Melissa",0,,1676
1683,Mortality salience increases personal optimism among individuals higher in trait self-control,"Reminders of personal mortality may tune attention toward positive information. Insofar as attending to positive things in life helps individuals to cope with awareness of death, individuals with higher trait self-control may be particularly adept at positive tuning under mortality salience. To test this hypothesis, the current study had participants complete a measure of trait self-control, contemplate their mortality or a control topic, and then complete a measure of personal optimism. Mortality salience increased personal optimism, but only among participants higher in trait self-control. Taken together with past research the current results suggest that individuals higher in trait self-control draw upon diverse sources of positivity under mortality salience, which may help explain why they enjoy more positive outcomes in life.","Kelley, Nicholas J. and Schmeichel, Br and on J.",1,,1677
1684,The Motivational Force of Descriptive Norms: For Whom and When Are Descriptive Norms Most Predictive of Behavior?,"Descriptive norms, or cognitions concerning the dominant beliefs, values, and behaviors of a particular reference group, are distinct from personal values and predict a wide range of cultural behavior. However, questions remain as to when and in what contexts descriptive norms predict behavior and what cultural, situational, and individual difference factors influence their motivational force. In this article, we focus on three primary motive goals that may help us determine when descriptive norms are particularly predictive: the goal to manage uncertainty and threat, the goal to manage impressions, and goals derived from power and dependence. We argue that descriptive norms serve important epistemic, identity, and social coordinative functions that help satisfy these goals.","Gelf and , Michele J. and Harrington, Jesse R.",0,,1678
1685,A Religious Worldview: Protecting One's Meaning System Through Religious Prejudice,"For some people, religion strongly influences their worldviews. We propose that religious outgroups threaten the foundational beliefs of people with strong religious worldviews ({RWVs}) by endorsing alternative belief systems and that this threat contributes to religious prejudice. To examine these ideas, we developed a measure of {RWV} strength and assessed the role of {RWV} threat in religious prejudice. Across five studies, strength of {RWV} was related to religious prejudice, including derogation and denial of alternative religious viewpoints, as well as support for suppressing, avoiding, and even aggressing against religious outgroups. These responses were strongest toward religious outgroups whose worldviews were the most different, and therefore most threatening. Mediational analyses revealed that strong {RWV} people expressed heightened prejudice because of the worldview threat posed by religious outgroup members. These findings indicate that the avoidance and subjugation of religious outgroups can serve as a worldview protection strategy for some people.","Goplen, Joanna and Plant, E. Ashby",0,,1679
1686,"Aging, Social Developmental, and Cultural Factors in Changing Patterns of Religious Involvement Over a 32-Year Period: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis of 80 Countries","Religious change has been studied from the perspectives of both individual development and societal progress, but a lack of long-term longitudinal data has limited the capacity to examine them simultaneously. This study uses repeated cross-sectional data from the World Values Survey/European Values Study, covering 80 nations over the period from 1981 to 2013 to estimate age, period, and cohort effects on mean changes in the subjective importance of God and attendance at religious services. A cross-classified mixed model approach was used, examining both random effects indicating between-country differences in these changes and fixed factors unifying them in a broader framework. Older age was associated with greater personal and organizational religious involvement in a large majority of societies, but the strength of this association differed by culture, with the largest mean effects occurring in Western nations. Period effects were detected in many cultural areas but were very heterogeneous in direction and magnitude. Period changes were related to national wealth, with increase in per capita gross domestic product being related to declines in mean religious involvement. Cohort effects were in evidence in relatively few societies. These results indicate that both individual aging processes and changes in the material environment may influence changes in religious involvement, in keeping with both psychological and sociological theory, but that culture also plays a role in the nature and speed of these changes.","Hayward, R.

1687,Exploring the Enigmatic Link between Religion and Anti-Black Attitudes,"This review explores social psychological perspectives on the complex relationship between religion and anti-Black prejudice in the United States. We examine the different ways in which religiosity has been conceptualized by behavioral scientists. We consider the methodological limitations of previous research, as well as how the advent of priming research introduces new empirical questions regarding religiosity and anti-Black prejudice, such as whether activation of different religious conceptions (e.g., God versus religion) or priming via different types of stimuli (e.g., words versus images) produces different outcomes. Finally, we discuss the lack of diverse samples in the present literature and highlight the need for additional research with Black American respondents. Conclusions consider the real world implications of links between religion and anti-Blackness for both White individuals (e.g., intergroup relations) and Black individuals (e.g., psychological functioning).","Howard, Simon and Sommers, Samuel R.",0,,1681
1688,"Of Caucasians, Asians, and Giraffes: The Influence of Categorization and Target Valence on Social Projection","Past research has indicated that social projection is moderated by categorization, with more projection onto ingroups than onto outgroups. However, a few studies have reported elevated levels of projection even onto outgroups. In line with recent evidence, we hypothesized that positive target valence is the key feature of conditions that elicit projection onto outgroups. The present research extends previous findings by testing whether the effect of valence occurs independent of categorization, with increased levels of projection onto positive ingroup and non-ingroup targets alike. We designed two experiments in which target valence was manipulated by means of evaluative conditioning. Category membership was varied by using faces of Caucasians, Asians, and giraffes. The results supported our valence hypothesis. Counter-intuitively, we also found higher levels of projection onto giraffes than onto humans. These findings suggest that current cognition-based models of projection are not sufficient to account for the whole range of projection phenomena.","Machunsky, Maya and Walther, Eva",0,,1682
1689,Anxieties about aging and death and psychological distress: The protective role of emotional complexity,"Death and aging anxieties are related to higher psychological distress, but no study has examined whether these relationships are moderated by emotional complexity, an important indicator of adaptive emotional regulation among older adults. Participants (N = 188; mean age = 57; range = 29-100) rated their death and aging anxieties, general psychological distress, and reported their emotions on a daily basis over 14 days. Results showed that emotional complexity moderated the relationship between each of the two anxieties and psychological distress (i.e., the positive relationship between the two anxieties and psychological distress existed only among subjects with low emotional complexity). The findings suggest that emotional complexity buffers against psychological distress, and can be further explored as a facilitating mechanism in protecting against the negative mental health effects of aging and death anxieties.

1690,On the nature of implicit soul beliefs: When the past weighs more than the present,"Intuitive childhood beliefs in dualism may lay the foundation for implicit soul and afterlife beliefs, which may diverge from explicit beliefs formed later in adulthood. Brief Implicit Association Tests were developed to investigate the relation of implicit soul and afterlife beliefs to childhood and current beliefs. Early but not current beliefs covaried with implicit beliefs. Results demonstrated greater discrepancies in current than in childhood soul and afterlife beliefs among religious groups, and no differences in implicit beliefs. These findings suggest that implicit soul and afterlife beliefs diverge from current self-reported beliefs, stemming instead from childhood beliefs.","Anglin, Stephanie M.",0,,1684

The effects of mortality salience and similarity on the Desire to Date in-group versus out-group members online,"Online dating has become an important resource for building intimate relationships. Similarity and group membership have been found to be as important for online and off-line dating. Research on terror management theory has shown that both factors shield against death anxieties, indicating difficulties for dissimilar and intergroup couples. Yet, no studyso farhas investigated both factors simultaneously after mortality salience ({MS}). To close this gap, the current study presented German participants (N = 249) with a dating app that randomly assigned them to a {MS} or control condition. Afterward, a candidate following a 2(group membership) x 2(similarity) design was suggested. After {MS}, in contrast to the control group, similarity increased and dissimilarity decreased the Desire to Date in-group but not out-group members.","Frischlich, Lena and Rieger, Diana and Dratsch, Thomas and Bente, Gary",1,,1685
1692,Fear Among the Extremes: How Political Ideology Predicts Negative Emotions and Outgroup Derogation,"The rigidity of the right hypothesis predicts that particularly the political right experiences fear and derogates outgroups. We propose that above and beyond that, the political extremes (at both sides of the spectrum) are more likely to display these responses than political moderates. Results of a large-scale sample reveal the predicted quadratic term on socio-economic fear. Moreover, although the political right is more likely to derogate the specific category of immigrants, we find a quadratic effect on derogation of a broad range of societal categories. Both extremes also experience stronger negative emotions about politics than politically moderate respondents. Finally, the quadratic effects on derogation of societal groups and negative political emotions were mediated by socio-economic fear, particularly among left- and right-wing extremists. It is concluded that negative emotions and outgroup derogation flourish among the extremes.","van Prooijen, Jan-Willem and Krouwel, Andre P. M. and Boiten, Max and Eendebak, Lennart",0,,1686
1693,The heavy weight of death: how anti-fat bias is affected by weight-based group membership and existential threat,"Anti-fat bias is marked by a devaluation of overweight people compared with non-overweight persons. Even though belonging to the same group, research on social identity theory ({SIT}) indicates that overweight people also devaluate overweight others. Merging insights from research on anti-fat bias, {SIT}, and terror management theory, our study (n=101) provides new insights on motivational aspects of anti-fat bias by investigating the effects of existential threat on the evaluation of non-overweight and overweight people. Results revealed that participants in the existential threat condition displayed in-group bias: Participants perceiving themselves as non-overweight showed more pronounced anti-fat bias compared with participants in the non-death threat condition. In contrast, participants perceiving themselves as overweight demonstrated less anti-fat bias than controls.","Seibert, Ann and Schindler, Simon and Reinhard, Marc-Andre",1,,1687
1694,The Cycle of Violence: Understanding Individual Participation in Collective Violence,"Why do ordinary people engage in collective violence, harming others on behalf of their group? In this article, we argue that the violent group itself, and the identity it bestows on participating members, is an often overlooked and yet fundamental source of motivation for an individual's participation in collective violence. Reviewing insights from social and moral psychology, military history, and public health, we outline how the psychology of individual violent behavior presents a puzzle. For an ordinary person, participation in violence is often an aversive and distressing experience, and yet violent behavior leads to more violence in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of collective violence allows us to make sense of this paradox. Violent groups can promote violent behavior among members by increasing members' motivation to engage in violence, particularly through group identification and deliberate strategies, and by removing psychological obstacles to violence (i.e., by making violence less aversive). Our synthesis of the literature points to a cycle of individuals' participation in collective violence, in which group identification motivates violent behavior and violent behavior increases identification with violent groups.","Littman, Rebecca and Paluck, Elizabeth Levy",0,,1688
1695,"Mortality salience, self-esteem, and defense of the group: mediating role of in-group identification","Numerous studies have shown that mortality salience strengthens defense of cultural institutions and that this effect is buffered by self-esteem. The present study examines a novel prediction, based on social identity processes, that group identification mediates the impact of the interaction of mortality salience and self-esteem on worldview defense. Self-esteem and mortality salience were manipulated using Greenberg and colleagues' standard methods, the dependent measure was defense of America, and the mediating variable was identification with America. As predicted, mortality salience only increased identification with America and defense of America when self-esteem was not enhanced, enhancing self-esteem attenuated the effects of mortality salience. Also following predictions, the interactive effect of mortality salience and self-esteem on defense of America was mediated by identification with America.","Hohman, Zachary P. and Hogg, Michael A.",1,,1689
1696,"To Nostalgize: Mixing Memory with Affect and Desire - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 51","Nostalgia is a self-conscious, bittersweet but predominantly positive and fundamentally social emotion. It arises from fond memories mixed with yearning about one's childhood, close relationships, or atypically positive events, and it entails a redemption trajectory. It is triggered by a variety of external stimuli or internal states, is prevalent, is universal, and is experienced across ages. Nostalgia serves a self-oriented function (by raising self-positivity and facilitating perceptions of a positive future), an existential function (by increasing perceptions of life as meaningful), and a sociality function (by increasing social connectedness, reinforcing socially oriented action tendencies, and promoting prosocial behavior). These functions are independent of the positive affect that nostalgia may incite. Also, nostalgia-elicited sociality often mediates the self-positivity and existential functions. In addition, nostalgia maintains psychological and physiological homeostasis along the following regulatory cycle: (i) Noxious stimuli, as general as avoidance motivation and as specific as self-threat (negative performance feedback), existential threat (meaninglessness, mortality awareness), social threat (loneliness, social exclusion), well-being threat (stress, boredom), or, perhaps surprisingly, physical coldness intensify felt nostalgia; (ii) in turn, nostalgia (measured or manipulated) alleviates the impact of threat by curtailing the influence of avoidance motivation on approach motivation, buttressing the self from threat, limiting defensive responding to meaninglessness, assuaging existential anxiety, repairing interpersonal isolation, diminishing the blow of stress, relieving boredom through meaning reestablishment, or producing the sensation of physical warmth. Nostalgia has a checkered history, but is now rehabilitated as an adaptive psychological resource.","Sedikides, Constantine and Wildschut, Tim and Routledge, Clay and Arndt, Jamie and Hepper, Erica G. and Zhou, Xinyue",0,,1690
1697,"A Biosocial Model of Affective Decision Making: Implications for Dissonance, Motivation, and Culture - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 52","Drawing on recent advances in both neuroscience and animal behavior, we propose a biosocial model of affective decision making, which holds that when people face a conflict between two competing behavioral options (e.g., go vs. no-go, approach vs. avoidance), they develop a new affective disposition that resolves the conflict. This newly emerging affect will enable one to select a response while forming the basis for an elaborate cognition that justifies the selected response. The model reconceptualizes cognitive dissonance as fundamentally affective and involving both predecisional and postdecisional components. Furthermore, by postulating both top-down and bottom-up neural pathways to regulate the sensitivity to behavioral conflict, it integrates prior evidence on factors that moderate dissonance, including action orientation, self-affirmation, mortality salience, and culture. It also offers new insights into a disparate set of motivational phenomena including animal behaviors that mimic cognitive dissonance, sunk-cost fallacy, addiction, and ego-depletion. Lastly, the biosocial model has implications for how humans may be affectively and motivationally attached to symbols of culture. Directions for future research are discussed.","Kitayama, Shinobu and Tompson, Steven",0,,1691
1698,Going along versus getting it right: The role of self-integrity in political conformity,"People often conform to the opinions of ingroup members, even when available evidence suggests that the group is misinformed. Following insights from the social identity approach and self-affirmation theory, it was hypothesized that people conform to salient opinions in an effort to maintain global self-integrity. In a series of experiments examining Americans' approval of President Obama and his policies, approval was consistently swayed by normative information (national polling data) but not by evidentiary information (indicators of national economic health), except under theory-predicted conditions. When participants had satisfied their sense of self-integrity with a self-affirmation exercise (Democrats in Study 1, Republicans in Study 2), or when they had low levels of American identification and thus were less concerned with national norms (Democrats and Republicans in Study 3), they showed the opposite pattern and were swayed by evidence in spite of contradicting normative information. The extent to which people are influenced by norms versus evidence in political judgment is shaped by social identity, one aspect of self-integrity. The results highlight a social psychological means to attenuate and potentially reverse conformity in the face of contradicting evidence, a finding with both practical and theoretical implications.

Four distinct research areas are reviewed. We begin with the literature on donations in general, and then move to the literature on donations to disaster victims specifically, which is what most of our own research has focused on. We then review the literature on intergroup prosociality, because many donations occur in some kind of intergroup context. We then cover some of the main insights from the literature on generic prosocial processes, which has generated insights that are generalizable to donations and have applied implications. Finally, we summarize some of the main recommendations for eliciting donations which can be generated from these literatures. An emphasis is placed on the translation of academic knowledge into practical steps which practitioners might find useful.","Zagefka, Hanna and James, Trevor",0,,1693
1700,"Thirty Years of Terror Management Theory: From Genesis to Revelation - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 52","Terror management theory posits that human awareness of the inevitability of death exerts a profound influence on diverse aspects of human thought, emotion, motivation, and behavior. People manage the potential for anxiety that results from this awareness by maintaining: (1) faith in the absolute validity of their cultural worldviews and (2) self-esteem by living up to the standards of value that are part of their worldviews. In this chapter, we take stock of the past 30 years of research and conceptual development inspired by this theory. After a brief review of evidence supporting the theory's fundamental propositions, we discuss extensions of the theory to shed light on: (1) the psychological mechanisms through which thoughts of death affect subsequent thought and behavior; (2) how the anxiety-buffering systems develop over childhood and beyond; (3) how awareness of death influenced the evolution of mind, culture, morality, and religion; (4) how death concerns lead people to distance from their physical bodies and seek solace in concepts of mind and spirit; and (5) the role of death concerns in maladaptive and pathological behavior. We also consider various criticisms of the theory and alternative conceptualizations that have been proposed. We conclude with a discussion of what we view as the most pressing issues for further research and theory development that have been inspired by the theory's first 30 years.","Pyszczynski, Tom and Solomon, Sheldon and Greenberg, Jeff",0,,1694
1701,"On the Panculturality of Self-enhancement and Self-protection Motivation: The Case for the Universality of Self-esteem - Advances in Motivation Science, Vol 2","Do self-enhancement/self-protection and self-esteem reflect fundamental human motivations or are they culturally bound occurrences? The debate on universalism versus cultural relativism of self-motives and self-esteem shows no sign of abatement. We advance the debate by proposing the extended self-enhancing tactician model. The model aspires to account for two seemingly contradictory phenomena: cross-cultural invariance (equivalence of self-motive strength and self-esteem desire across cultures) and cross-cultural variability (differential manifestations of self-motives and self-esteem across cultures). The model's four foundational tenets address cross-cultural invariance: (1) The individual self is panculturally valued, and it is so over the relational or collective self; (2) The self-enhancement/self-protection motives are equally potent in East and West; (3) The structure of self-enhancement and self-protection strivings is similar across the cultural divide; and (4) the desire for self-esteem is pancultural. The {SCENT}-R model's four key postulates address cross-cultural variability. First, Easterners assign relative importance to, and report higher, liking-based self-esteem, as well as consider collectivistic attributes important and self-enhance on them, whereas Westerners assign relative importance to, and report higher, competence-based self-esteem, as well as consider individualistic attributes important and self-enhance on them. Second, when constraints on candid self-enhancement are lifted, Easterners behave like Westerners: they report higher modesty and lower self-esteem than Westerners, but, controlling for modesty, differences in self-esteem disappear; they self-enhance in competitive, but self-efface in cooperative, settings; they profit from other-mediated than own-initiated self-enhancement. Third, implicit self-esteem is similarly high across cultures. Fourth, self-esteem and self-enhancement/self-protection confer parallel benefits in East-West, depending in part on domain relevance. Self-enhancement and self-protection, as well as self-esteem, reflect fundamental human motivation.","Sedikides, Constantine and Gaertner, Lowell and Cai, Huajian",0,,1695

It is now important to explore cultural identity claritythe extent to which beliefs about identity that arise from one's cultural group membership(s) are clearly and confidently understood. We describe a novel theoretical model to explain why having a clear and confident understanding of one's cultural identity is important for psychological well-being, as it clarifies one's understanding of personal identity. We propose that a clear cultural identity clarifies one's personal existence, by providing a clear normative template, reducing personal uncertainty, providing an individual with a sense of continuity, and buffering an individual against the fear of death. We discuss the implications of this model within our complex cultural worlds.","Usborne, Esther and de la Sablonniere, Roxane",0,,1696
1703,How conflict begets conflict: Activation of the ethos of conflict in times of distress in a society involved in an intractable conflict,"The research addressed the possible association between distress and the Ethos of Conflict ({EOC}), a system of shared beliefs that characterizes societies involved in intractable conflicts. It is argued that the {EOC} may assist processes of coping with distress and therefore will be activated in times of distress. Three studies were conducted with samples of Israeli Jews, who are involved in an intractable conflict with the Palestinians. Studies 1 a and 1b demonstrated that conditions of high (vs, low) distress, either related or unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, increased {EOC} activation but not self-reported {EOC} adherence. Study 2 demonstrated that the activation of the {EOC} under distress facilitated processing of {EOC}-consistent information and hindered processing of {EOC}-contradicting information. The findings are consistent with the notion that the {EOC} may play a role in coping with distress, but this association may pose a barrier to peaceful conflict resolution.

Many scientific disciplines have tried, and still try to give a solution to this question. The purpose of this research is to provide some answers through the analysis of the relevant literature. There will be initially presented the three main theoretical lines related to pro-social behavior (evolutionary, selfish and altruistic), a comparison that highlights the common boundaries of these approaches, and a recent model that proposes to integrate them. Subsequently, empirical evidence will be presented showing the main errors related to emotional and cognitive processes that characterize philanthropic decisions.","Hysenbelli, Dorina",0,,1698
1705,Affirming belief in scientific progress reduces environmentally friendly behaviour,"Many people are reluctant to behave in environmentally friendly ways. One possible explanation might be that the motivation to behave in environmentally friendly ways is undermined by the way scientific progress is overstated in the popular media. Four experiments show that portraying science as rapidly progressing-and thus enabling society to control problems related to the natural environment and human health in the not-too-distant future-is detrimental to environmentally friendly behaviour because such a frame affirms perceptions of an orderly (vs chaotic) world. This in turn negatively affects the likelihood of engaging in environmentally friendly behaviour. Simultaneously, communication that questions (vs affirms) scientific progress leads to lower perceptions of order and consequential increases in environmentally friendly behaviour. These findings show that when the aim is to promote environmentally friendly attitudes and behaviour, it helps to not overstate scientific progress.

1706,Following and Resisting Body Image Ideals in Advertising: The Moderating Role of Extrinsic Contingency Focus,"Extrinsic contingency focus reflects people's tendency to derive self-esteem by meeting socially (versus personally) defined standards. Three studies examined the relationship between extrinsic contingency focus ({ECF}) and responses to social ideals. The results of Studies 1 and 2 showed that exposure to advertisements that contained idealized body images led high-{ECF} participants to engage in behaviors directed toward the attainment of the ideal. For low-{ECF} participants, exposure to this type of advertisement led to behaviors aimed at resisting the social ideal. Study 3 showed that self-affirmation reduced striving to meet and resist social ideals among high- and low-{ECF} individuals. Implications of these findings relative to the body image literature and directions for future research are discussed.","Williams, Todd J. and Schimel, Jeff and Hayes, Joseph and Usta, Murat",0,,1700
1707,Self-affirmation counters the effects of self-regulatory resource depletion on height perception,"Perception of the layout of the environment may be influenced by factors other than the physical information provided to the retina, including self-regulatory and psychosocial resources. We tested whether depletion of self-regulatory resources affected estimates of the height of a balcony and whether a psychosocial resource could substitute for self-regulatory resources among individuals making such estimates. Undergraduates performed a self-regulation depletion task and a values-affirmation task or their control equivalents in a 2 x 2 design (N = 80) and viewed a balcony height from above. A rope was attached to the height to make action on the height possible. Those who expended self-regulatory resources overestimated the balcony height more than the control group (both groups overestimated relative to the true height). However, this effect was counteracted by the values-affirmation task. Depleted participants who affirmed core values did not overestimate the height as much, resulting in estimates similar to the non-depleted participants. These results were not mediated by perceived threat posed by the height, positive mood or more specific positive, other-directed feelings. Our results suggest that visual perception of a threatening environment can be affected by the resources available to the perceiver for performing action on the environment. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1708,The Uncertainty Paradox: Perceived Threat Moderates the Effect of Uncertainty on Political Tolerance,"People respond to dissimilar political beliefs in a variety of ways, ranging from openness and acceptance to closed-mindedness and intolerance. While there is reason to believe that uncertainty may influence political tolerance, the direction of this influence remains unclear. We propose that threat moderates the effect of uncertainty on tolerance; when safe, uncertainty leads to greater tolerance, yet when threatened, uncertainty leads to reduced tolerance. Using independent manipulations of threat and uncertainty, we provide support for this hypothesis. This research demonstrates that, although feelings of threat and uncertainty can be independent, it is also important to understand their interaction.","Haas, Ingrid Johnsen and Cunningham, William A.",0,,1702

Studies 1, 2, and 3 examined how changes in materialistic aspirations related to changes in well-being, using varying time frames (12 years, 2 years, and 6 months), samples ({US} young adults and Icelandic adults), and measures of materialism and well-being. Across all three studies, results supported the hypothesis that people's well-being improves as they place relatively less importance on materialistic goals and values, whereas orienting toward materialistic goals relatively more is associated with decreases in well-being over time. Study 2 additionally demonstrated that this association was mediated by changes in psychological need satisfaction. A fourth, experimental study showed that highly materialistic {US} adolescents who received an intervention that decreased materialism also experienced increases in self-esteem over the next several months, relative to a control group. Thus, well-being changes as people change their relative focus on materialistic goals.","Kasser, Tim and Rosenblum, Katherine L. and Sameroff, Arnold J. and Deci, Edward L. and Niemiec, Christopher P. and Ryan, Richard M. and Arnadottir, Osp and Bond, Rod and Dittmar, Helga and Dungan, Nathan and Hawks, Susan",0,,1703
1710,The Psychology of Radicalization and Deradicalization: How Significance Quest Impacts Violent Extremism,"We present a model of radicalization and deradicalization based on the notion that the quest for personal significance constitutes a major motivational force that may push individuals toward violent extremism. Radicalization is defined as the process of supporting or engaging in activities deemed (by others) as in violation of important social norms (e.g., the killing of civilians). In these terms, radicalization (1) is a matter of degree (in which mere attitudinal support for violence reflects a lower degree of radicalization than actual engagement in violence); (2) represents a subjective judgment proffered by those for whom the violated norms seem important but not by those who have devalued or suppressed the norms in question. Our radicalization/deradicalization model contains three crucial components: (1) the motivational component (the quest for personal significance) that defines a goal to which one may be committed, (2) the ideological component that in addition identifies the means of violence as appropriate for this goal's pursuit, and (3) the social process of networking and group dynamics through which the individual comes to share in the violence-justifying ideology and proceeds to implement it as a means of significance gain. We present empirical evidence consistent with our model's assumptions and discuss its implications for policies of preventing radicalization and effecting deradicalization.","Kruglanski, Arie W. and Gelf and , Michele J. and Belanger, Jocelyn J. and Shevel and , Anna and Hetiarachchi, Malkanthi and Gunaratna, Rohan",0,,1704

However, individual differences in commitment to a particular worldview may predict {DTA} when that belief is challenged. In the present research, we tested if individual differences in belief in a just world ({BJW}) relate to {DTA} when the {BJW} is undermined. In Studies 1 and 3, {BJW} was associated with {DTA} when people reflected on an unfair experience. Study 3 indicated that this effect is driven by general {BJW}.

1713,"The Going Gets Tough, So Let's Go Shopping: On Materialism, Coping, and Consumer Behaviors Under Traumatic Stress","This study investigated the way in which exposure to traumatic stress, posttraumatic reactions, and materialistic values impact coping and maladaptive consumption behaviors in a real-life traumatic situation. One hundred thirty-nine Israelis were sampled from a town under constant rocket fire (a high-stress environment), and 187 comparison respondents were sampled from a low-stress location. Our data show a main effect for materialism for all of the distress and maladaptive consumer behaviors under study, as well as for most coping behaviors with the exception of interpersonal expressive coping. In the high-stress group, interpersonal expressive coping, reflecting an inclination to utilize social support, was highest among mildly materialistic individuals. Highly materialistic persons were, presumably, more oriented to objects than humans, rendering a more support-seeking way of coping less relevant for them. Highly materialistic participants in the high-stress group reported the highest levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. The results of this study also suggest that the pleasures of shopping cannot attenuate posttraumatic distress and that maladaptive shopping behaviors increase with the level of traumatic exposure.","Somer, Eli and Ruvio, Ayalla",0,,1706

1715,"Threat and Defense: From Anxiety to Approach - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 49","The social psychological literature on threat and defense is fragmented. Groups of researchers have focused on distinct threats, such as mortality, uncertainty, uncontrollability, or meaninglessness, and have developed separate theoretical frameworks for explaining the observed reactions. In the current chapter, we attempt to integrate old and new research, proposing both a taxonomy of variation and a common motivational process underlying people's reactions to threats. Following various kinds of threats, people often turn to abstract conceptions of reality-they invest more extremely in belief systems and worldviews, social identities, goals, and ideals. We suggest that there are common motivational processes that underlie the similar reactions to all of these diverse kinds of threats. We propose that (1) all of the threats present people with discrepancies that immediately activate basic neural processes related to anxiety. (2) Some categories of defenses are more proximal and symptom-focused, and result directly from anxious arousal and heightened attentional vigilance associated with anxious states. (3) Other kinds of defenses operate more distally and mute anxiety by activating approach-oriented states. (4) Depending on the salient dispositional and situational affordances, these distal, approach-oriented reactions vary in the extent to which they (a) resolve the original discrepancy or are merely palliative; (b) are concrete or abstract; (c) are personal or social. We present results from social neuroscience and standard social psychological experiments that converge on a general process model of threat and defense.","Jonas, Eva and {McGregor}, Ian and Klackl, Johannes and Agroskin, Dmitrij and Fritsche, Immo and Holbrook, Colin and Nash, Kyle and Proulx, Travis and Quirin, Markus",0,,1708

1717,Extinction threat and reciprocal threat reduction: Collective angst predicts willingness to compromise in intractable intergroup conflicts,"Two experiments examined the impact of ingroup extinction threat on willingness to compromise with an adversary group. Specifically, Israel's ability to cope with a nuclear capable Iran was manipulated and Israelis' willingness to compromise with Hamas (Experiment 1) or the Palestinian Authority (Experiment 2) was assessed. In Experiment 1, extinction threat decreased willingness to compromise with Hamas-an effect mediated by heightened collective angst. Conversely, in Experiment 2, extinction threat increased willingness to compromise with the Palestinian Authority, again via collective angst. The reason for this inverted effect in Experiment 2 was perceived reciprocal threat reduction-the belief that compromise with the Palestinian Authority would reduce the Iranian threat (a belief not relevant to the issue of compromise with Hamas). Implications for the understanding of intergroup conflicts and peace making are discussed within the context of the role played by collective angst.","Halperin, Eran and Porat, Roni and Wohl, Michael J.

1718,Scientific faith: Belief in science increases in the face of stress and existential anxiety,"Growing evidence indicates that religious belief helps individuals to cope with stress and anxiety. But is this effect specific to supernatural beliefs, or is it a more general function of belief including belief in science? We developed a measure of belief in science and conducted two experiments in which we manipulated stress and existential anxiety. In Experiment 1, we assessed rowers about to compete (high-stress condition) and rowers at a training session (low-stress condition). As predicted, rowers in the high-stress group reported greater belief in science. In Experiment 2, participants primed with mortality (vs. participants in a control condition) reported greater belief in science. In both experiments, belief in science was negatively correlated with religiosity. Thus, some secular individuals may use science as a form of ""faith"" that helps them to deal with stressful and anxiety-provoking situations. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In Study 1, we exposed participants to three different kinds of death-related pictures (terrorism vs. natural disasters vs. graveyards) or neutral pictures. The results showed that death-related visual material led to more justice sensitivity from three perspectives (victim, observer, and perpetrator) than neutral visual material. Likewise, Study 2 indicated that fake newspaper articles claiming that the likelihood of terrorism is very high (vs. low) strengthened these three justice sensitivity types. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Kastenmueller, Andreas and Greitemeyer, Tobias and Hindocha, Neil and Tattersall, Andrew J. and Fischer, Peter",0,,1712
1720,Fear of Death and Supernatural Beliefs: Developing a New Supernatural Belief Scale to Test the Relationship,"Fear of death features in both historical and contemporary theories of religion, but the relationship between death anxiety and religious belief is still ambiguous, largely due to the use of inappropriate or imprecise measures. The current studies therefore aimed to develop a valid, targeted measure of respondents' tendency towards religious belief, the Supernatural Belief Scale' ({SBS}), and to use the {SBS} to examine the relation between death anxiety and religious belief. Results indicate that the {SBS} shows high reliability and convergent validity and that its relation to death anxiety depends on participants' religious identification: religious' participants fear death less the stronger their religious beliefs, whereas non-religious' participants are more inclined towards religious belief the more they fear death. These studies contribute a new measurement tool for research on religious belief and provide a starting point for an experimental integration of discrepant research findings.

1721,Commitment and Extremism: A Goal Systemic Analysis,"Growing evidence suggests that uncertainty is related to extremism in its various forms. The aim of the present article is to probe the underlying psychological mechanisms of this relation. We begin by considering two disparate definitions of extremism as: (1) expressed zeal/attitude polarity, and (2) deviation from a norm. Zeal constitutes a direct expression of goal commitment, whereas deviant behavior is likely to occur under high commitment because of the greater perceived instrumentality of such behavior to the goal. We discuss a psychological mechanism that implies this increased instrumentality of deviant behavior to its goal. From this perspective, the relation between uncertainty and extremism represents a special case of the general relation between goal commitment and extremism: An aversively high degree of uncertainty augments commitment to the goal of uncertainty reduction. This in turn increases the appeal of extreme expressions seen as effective ways and means to uncertainty reduction.","Klein, Kristen M. and Kruglanski, Arie W.",0,,1714
1722,A Raw Deal: Heightened Liberalism Following Exposure to Anomalous Playing Cards,"According to the meaning maintenance model, people may respond to meaning violations by affirming unrelated beliefs to which they are committed. While this affirmation generally moves in the direction of social inequality, meaning violations that are not personally threateningbut that nevertheless evoke uncertaintyshould evoke a heightened preference for social equality (i.e., a socially liberal judgment). We tested this hypothesis in an experiment that exposed participants to reverse colored playing cards, where participants were subsequently more supportive of Affirmative Action if they were relatively committed to a belief that social inequality is unjust. This study demonstrates that people will make heightened socially liberal judgments following a meaning violation that is not personally threatening, and that is unrelated to the affirmed meaning frameworks.","Proulx, Travis and Major, Brenda",0,,1715
1723,On the meaningfulness of behavior: An expectancy x value approach,"Our research examines people's concept of 'meaningful behavior' from an expectancy x value perspective. Specifically, we argue that people consider two elements when inferring the meaningfulness of behavior: the value of the goals that the behavior relates to and the degree to which the behavior is useful for the achievement of these goals. A series of five studies demonstrates that behavior is considered to be 'meaningful' if it is highly instrumental for a highly valued goal. Our expectancy x value approach offers a straightforward yet crucial perspective of how people infer whether or not everyday life behaviors are meaningful to them. The implications of our findings for research on meaningfulness, meaning-regulation, and sense making are discussed.","van Tilburg, Wijn and A. P. and Igou, Eric R.",0,,1716
1724,"Anxious Uncertainty and Reactive Approach Motivation ({RAM}) for Religious, Idealistic, and Lifestyle Extremes","Reactive Approach Motivation ({RAM}) theory proposes that the personal uncertainty arising from motivational conflict causes anxiety, and that anxiety draws people to extremes because extremes activate approach-motivated states that automatically downregulate anxiety. Five new studies consolidate existing evidence for the {RAM} view of uncertainty-related threats and reactive extremism. In Studies 1-3, religious, idealistic, and {RAM} reactions after agentic, communal, and mortality threats were most extreme when threat-relevant goals had been implicitly primed to create motivational conflict. In Study 4 uncertainty predicted extreme reactions only if goal conflict had been experimentally manipulated. In Study 5 personal uncertainty uniquely predicted lifestyle extremes among undergraduates whose educational goals were conflicted by a labor disruption at their university. Results converge on the conclusion that uncertainty-related threats cause defensively extreme {RAM} reactions only if they arouse personal uncertainty about active goals. Results suggest that policies and programs to support the prosocial and/or nonextreme goals, ideals, and identifications of at-risk people would reduce their motivation for antisocial extremism.","{McGregor}, Ian and Prentice, Mike and Nash, Kyle",1,,1717
1725,"Common genetic influences underpin religiosity, community integration, and existential uncertainty","Although genetic factors underpin individual differences in religiosity, the psychological mechanisms through which such influences are manifested are presently unknown. Religiosity is associated with concerns for community integration and existential certainty, suggesting that heritable influences underlying such sentiments may overlap with heritable influences underpinning religiosity. Here we tested this hypothesis within a genetically informative design, using a large, nationally-representative twin sample. As predicted, heritable effects underlying community integration and existential uncertainty were strongly overlapping with the heritable influences on religiosity. These findings are consistent with the position that individual differences in religiosity are mediated through biological systems involved in meeting both social and existential needs, although further work is required to determine directions of causal action.

1726,Exploring the relationship between adult attachment style and the identifiable victim effect in helping behavior,"People's preference to help victims about whom they have some information is known as the identifiable victim effect. Results of three studies, in which dispositional attachment styles were measured (study 1) and activated in a between-subjects priming manipulation (studies 2 and 3), suggest that the intensity of this phenomenon is related to the potential helper's adult attachment style. Specifically, we found that secure people provide similar levels of help to identified and unidentified victims. Attachment avoidance is associated with lower donations to both types of victims. Finally, the biggest gap between donations to identified and unidentified victims was found for anxious people, who tend to donate relatively higher amounts to identified victims and lower amounts to unidentified ones. Moreover, people under attachment-anxiety priming tend to perceive less similarity and connectedness between themselves and unidentified victims as opposed to identified victims, a tendency that may underlie the identifiability effect.

1727,Sore Losers: On Perceptions of Defeat and Displaced Retaliation,"This research examined whether perceptions of defeat instigate a motivation to retaliate and displace aggression toward an adversary's affiliates. In Study 1, 147 Israeli participants were primed with perceptions of victory, defeat, or assigned to a neutral condition and then rated their willingness to wage war against a weak foe or a strong foe. Perceptions of defeat increased support of military action against a weak foe but not against a strong foe compared with both the neutral and the victory conditions. Study 2 (N = 270) replicated the findings of Study 1 and showed that following defeat displaced aggression is greater toward a weak accomplice than toward both a strong accomplice and the original foe, and indicated that the effect of defeat on retaliation is mediated by increased in-group identification and commitment. Results suggest that attempts to deter opponents with military force may backfire and inadvertently fuel the cycle of violence.","Ein-Dor, Tsachi and Hirschberger, Gilad",0,,1720
1728,Mortality salience and uncertainty: Similar effects but different processes?,"Three experimental studies investigated whether death-thoughts avoidance as a consequence of mortality salience and need for certainty as a consequence of uncertainty are two different motivational states. The results suggest that although death-thought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both). However, whereas the impact of uncertainty on negative attitudes towards an out-group with different worldviews (Arabs) was mediated only by anxiety (measured retrospectively), the effect of mortality salience was mediated by both retrospective anxiety and death-thought accessibility. These findings imply that similar effects that have been obtained by these two manipulations are, at least partly, the result of different processes.

1729,The Many Ways to Be Marginal in a Group,"Previous theory and research primarily address marginal group members on the path to achieve core membership status. The authors argue that these only represent one form of marginality and that there are many other ways to be marginal within the group. The authors develop a dynamic model in which marginality is conceptualized as resulting from group and individual negotiation about inclusion (the Marginality as Resulting From Group and Individual Negotiation About Inclusion [{MARGINI}] model), and where individual and group inclusion goals can converge (resulting in relatively stable forms of marginality) or diverge (resulting in less stable forms of marginality). When the marginal position is unstable, individuals can either be motivated to move toward or move further away from the group, and such changing inclusion goals are associated with different emotions and behaviors. The authors argue that one needs to understand the interplay between individual and group inclusion goals to predict and explain the full complexity and diversity of the behavior of marginal group members.","Ellemers, Naomi and Jetten, Jol and a",0,,1722

1731,"On Sense-Making Reactions and Public Inhibition of Benign Social Motives: An Appraisal Model of Prosocial Behavior - Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol 48","This chapter describes a body of work on the social psychological implications of behavioral inhibition and disinhibition. Many social philosophers, economists, and other theorists have long assumed that it is good when people inhibit their behaviors, because behavioral inhibition will lead people to refrain from egoistic and socially undesirable behavior. In contrast, the line of research we describe shows that sometimes it is actions with benign social motives that are inhibited. Especially in confusing, unusual, ambiguous, or otherwise unsettling situations, people try to make sense of what is going on and how to behave. Sense making and social appraisal is facilitated when ongoing behavioral action is inhibited, but too strong activation of the behavioral inhibition system can block prosocial choices and prosocial behavior. Thus, lowering behavioral inhibition by reminding people of disinhibited behaviors they have performed in the past can promote prosocial choices and behavior. Findings reviewed here indeed reveal robust effects of behavioral disinhibition on classic social psychological phenomena, such as bystander intervention, moral decision making, conformity, ingroup affiliation, and social justice. These findings fit an appraisal inhibition model of prosocial behavior. This model describes how people appraise situations and the psychological processes that lead them to engage in or refrain from normative and prosocial behaviors.","van den Bos, Kees and Lind, E.

Often, these behaviors involve the affirmation of alternative beliefs or goals, which may or may not be relevant to the commitments that were threatened. Just as often, an aversive state is assumed to follow from the experience of the threat, which is understood to motivate the compensation efforts. Despite the analogous qualities of these effects, there are many different theories within the ""threat-compensation"" literature purporting to explain some or all of the analogous phenomena. In this introduction to the special issue (""Threat-Compensation in Social Psychology: Is There a Core Motivation?""), I will outline the rationale for potentially understanding these effects as following from a common psychological mechanism.

For the first time we test a full theoretical model in which system justification mediates the effects of individual differences in epistemic, existential, and relational needs on attitudes toward public policy issues and social movements. Specifically, we conducted a national survey of 182 Americans and found that, as hypothesized, lower need for cognition, greater death anxiety, and a stronger desire to share reality each contributed significantly and independently to economic system justification, which, in turn, contributed to support for the Tea Party (a movement aimed at restoring America's ""traditional values"") and opposition to Occupy Wall Street (a movement seeking to reduce social and economic inequality and minimize corporate influence on government). Economic system justification also mediated the effects of these needs on the endorsement of status quo positions with respect to health care, immigration, global climate change, and the ""Ground Zero mosque."" These findings suggest that epistemic, existential, and relational needs lead disproportionately to support for system-justifying, rather than system-challenging, policies and movements.","Hennes, Erin P. and Nam, H.

Disagreement reigns, however, regarding the nature of the mechanism that underlies such compensatory activity. We propose that the desire for coherence that motivates self-verification processes underlies these processes. For example, research on self-verification has demonstrated that just as people with positive self-views react to negative evaluations by amplifying their efforts to confirm their positive self-views, people with negative self-views react to positive evaluations by amplifying their efforts to confirm negative self-views. Further, whereas past research on self-verification strivings demonstrate that coherence strivings motivate efforts to confirm negative as well as positive self-views, recent work on meaning maintenance activities indicates that people work to verify implicit as well as explicit self-views.","Swann, William B. and Brooks, Matthew",0,,1727

1736,When a Threat to the Brand Is a Threat to the Self: The Importance of Brand Identification and Implicit Self-Esteem in Predicting Defensiveness,"This research examines how people respond when a commercial brand they identify with is threatened. Across four studies, the authors found that among participants who identified with a brand, a threat to the brand elicited the same responses as a threat to the self. Specifically, participants with low implicit self-esteem defended the brand when the self was activated, unlike their high implicit self-esteem counterparts. In addition, brand defense was reduced when individuals had the opportunity to affirm a valued aspect of their self-concept. These findings suggest that when a brand that people identify with is threatened, they may defend the brand to preserve the integrity of the self. More broadly, these findings are consistent with the notion that brands may be included into the extended self-concept, which supports William James's original ideas concerning the breadth and heterogeneity of the self.","Lisjak, Monika and Lee, Angela Y. and Gardner, Wendi L.",0,,1729

Using Cyberball, we examined how adolescents from different ethnic groups in the Netherlands (of Moroccan, Turkish, and Dutch descent with either Muslim, Christian, or secular beliefs) responded to being included or excluded by ethnic in- and outgroup members. We expected that exclusion by ethnic outgroup members would represent a categorization threat and would result in greater hostility. We hypothesized that exclusion by ethnic ingroup members would represent an acceptance threat and would result in responses that reduce uncertainty and increase one's chances of being accepted by others (e.g.. a stronger endorsement of fundamentalist religious beliefs). The results revealed that among all ethnic groups, exclusion by ethnic outgroup members led to more hostility toward the co-players and the co-players' ethnic group than exclusion by ethnic ingroup members. This was mediated by the extent to which people attributed their exclusion to the racist attitudes of their co-players. Among Muslims and Christians, exclusion by ethnic ingroup members led to more support for fundamentalist beliefs. We discuss the theoretical extension that these results provide, and practical issues raised regarding the consequences that may occur through the marginalization of religious and ethnic groups.

1738,When Does Responsiveness Pique Sexual Interest? Attachment and Sexual Desire in Initial Acquaintanceships,"Three studies examined the contribution of attachment orientation and perceived partner responsiveness to sexual desire in initial acquaintanceships. In all studies, participants discussed a recent negative event with an unfamiliar, opposite-sex partner and then rated how responsive this partner had been during the interaction and their desire to have sex with him or her. Study 1 examined the association between perceived partner responsiveness and sexual desire in randomly paired strangers. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally manipulated partner responsiveness by standardized Instant Messages (Study 2) and a confederate's responsive or unresponsive reactions during face-to-face interviews (Study 3). Results indicated that perceiving a partner as responsive was associated with heightened interest in sex with this partner, primarily among less avoidant people. These results are consistent with research showing that secure individuals see sex as a means of becoming close to relationship partners, whereas avoidant individuals tend to approach sex in distancing ways.","Birnbaum, Gurit E. and Reis, Harry T.",0,,1731
1739,The social impact of pathogen threat: How disease salience influences conformity,"Our human ancestors learned to use morphological deviations from the normal population to identify conspecific pathogen carriers and developed group normative practices in fighting local diseases. Modern conformity is still driven in part by disease avoidance. In this study, we tested the association between pathogen threat and conformity in three studies. A survey of 164 college students revealed that perceived vulnerability to disease uniquely predicted conformity tendencies. Results from the next two experiments showed that, in comparison to the control groups, participants primed by pathogen threat conformed more to majority views when evaluating abstract art drawings and rated themselves as more conforming on a questionnaire. There appears to be an evolved pathogen-avoidance mechanism that includes not only out-group avoidance strategies as have been found by other researchers, but also in-group approach strategies such as conformity.

1740,The Need to Belong Can Motivate Belief in God,"The need to belong can motivate belief in God. In Study 1, 40 undergraduates read bogus astrophysics articles proving God's existence or not offering proof. Participants in the proof-for-God condition reported higher belief in God (compared to control) when they chronically imagined God as accepting but lower belief in God when they imagined God as rejecting. Additionally, in Study 2 (72 undergraduates), these effects did not occur when participants belongingness need was satisfied by priming close others. Study 3 manipulated 79 Internet participants image of God. Chronic believers in the God-is-rejecting condition reported lower religious behavioral intentions than chronic believers in the God-is-accepting condition, and this effect was mediated by lower desires for closeness with God. In Study 4 (106 Internet participants), chronic believers with an accepting image of God reported that their belief in God is motivated by belongingness needs.","Gebauer, Jochen E. and Maio, Gregory R.",0,,1733
1741,Collective narcissism and anti-Semitism in Poland,"Two studies examined the relationship between collective narcissism-an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the greatness of an in-group (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, \& Jayawickreme, 2009) - and anti-Semitism in Poland. The results indicate that this relationship is simultaneously mediated by (a) a belief that the in-group is constantly threatened by hostile intentions of other groups (Polish siege beliefs; Bar-Tal \& Antebi, 1992a, 1992b) and (b) a belief that the Jews are a particularly threatening out-group because they secretly aim to dominate the world (the conspiracy stereotype of Jews; Bergmann, 2008; Kofta \& Sedek, 2005). These results confirm that collective narcissism predicts prejudice against social groups perceived as threatening. Collective narcissists' sensitivity to intergroup threat is composed of beliefs about vulnerability of the in-group and hostility of the out-group.","de Zavala, Agnieszka Golec and Cichocka, Aleks and ra",0,,1734
1742,Political ideology as motivated social cognition: Behavioral and neuroscientific evidence,"Ideology is a potent motivational force; human beings are capable of committing atrocities (as well as acts of generosity and courage) and sacrificing even their own lives for the sake of abstract belief systems. In this article, we summarize the major tenets of a model of political ideology as motivated social cognition (Jost et al. in Psychol Bull 129:339-375, 2003a, Psychol Bull 129:389-393, 2003b, Person Soc Psychol Bull 33:989-1007, 2007), focusing on epistemic, existential, and relational motives and their implications for left-right (or liberal-conservative) political orientation. We review behavioral evidence indicating that chronically and temporarily activated needs to reduce uncertainty, ambiguity, threat, and disgust are positively associated with conservatism (or negatively associated with liberalism). Studies from neuroscience and genetics suggest that right- (vs. left-) wing orientation is associated with greater neural sensitivity to threat and larger amygdala volume, as well as less sensitivity to response conflict and smaller anterior cingulate volume. These findings and others provide converging evidence for Jost and colleagues' model of ideology as motivated social cognition and, more broadly, reflect the utility of an integrative political neuroscience approach to understanding the basic cognitive, neural, and motivational processes that give rise to ideological activity.","Jost, John T. and Amodio, David M.",0,,1735
1743,Belongingness as a Core Personality Trait: How Social Exclusion Influences Social Functioning and Personality Expression,"People have a fundamental need for positive and lasting relationships. This need to belong is rooted in evolutionary history and gave rise to the development of traits that enable individuals to gain acceptance and to avoid rejection. Because belongingness is a core component of human functioning, social exclusion should influence many cognitive, emotional, and behavioral outcomes and personality expression. This article summarizes recent evidence that social exclusion causes an assortment of outcomes, many of which depend on whether the excluded can gain acceptance or forestall possible distress. It highlights common overlap in physical and social pain systems and how a physical painkiller can reduce the pain of social exclusion. Finally, it shows how social exclusion moderates the effects of traits on cognition, emotion, and behavior. To appreciate personality processes in social contexts, scientists should consider how people respond to social exclusion and how the need to belong influences personality expression.","{DeWall}, C.

1744,Collective Reactions to Threat: Implications for Intergroup Conflict and for Solving Societal Crises,"Personal and collective threat can breed ethnocentrism and intergroup conflict. We present a model of group-based control to elucidate motivational underpinnings of these effects from a social psychological perspective. Reviewed empirical evidence illustrates the effects of personal threat on ethnocentric attitudes. Moreover, evidence reveals that perceived lack of personal control of important aspects of one's life induces people to support and defend social in-groups. This is because people heuristically believe that groups are homogeneous actors of shared goals that may promise the symbolic restoration of group members' sense of global control. We discuss the effects complex real-world threats (economic crises, terrorism, and climate change) have on ethnocentric tendencies and how we explain this within the control model. Finally, we elaborate on implications for reducing ethnocentric threat responses and on possible prosocial consequences of threat that may help to solve societal crises.","Fritsche, Immo and Jonas, Eva and Kessler, Thomas",0,,1737
1745,Effects of low survivability cues and participant sex on physiological and behavioral responses to sexual stimuli,"According to life history theory, environmental cues indicating that one's future survivability is low increase reproductive effort. This suggests that exposure to low survivability cues will increase people's preparedness to engage in sex. However, according to sexual selection theory and parental investment theory, evolutionary pressures favored a more conservative sexual strategy among women compared to men. We therefore hypothesized that men, but not women, would respond to low survivability cues with increased sexual preparedness. Accordingly, both subliminal and supraliminal death primes (as compared with control primes) led men, but not women, to exhibit increased physiological arousal in response to sexual images (Study 1), and stronger approach-oriented behavioral responses to sexual images (Study 2). Theoretical implications for life history theory are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Gillath, Omri and L and au, Mark J. and Selcuk, Emre and Goldenberg, Jamie L.",1,,1738
1746,Motivated Closed-Mindedness Mediates the Effect of Threat on Political Conservatism,"In this article we synthesize theory and research from several areas of psychology and political science to propose and test a causal model of the effects of threat on political attitudes. Based in part on prior research showing that fear, threat, and anxiety decrease cognitive capacity and motivation, we hypothesize that under high (vs. low) threat, people will seek to curtail open-ended information searches and exhibit motivated closed-mindedness (one aspect of the need for cognitive closure). The subjective desire for certainty, control, and closure, in turn, is expected to increase the individual's affinity for political conservatism, insofar as resistance to change and adherence to authority figures and conventional forms of morality are assumed to satisfy these epistemic motives more successfully than their ideological opposites. Consistent with this account, we find in Studies 1a and 1b that putting people into a highly threatened mindset leads them to exhibit an increase in motivated closed-mindedness and to perceive the world as more dangerous. Furthermore, in Study 2 we demonstrate that a subtle threat manipulation increases self-reported conservatism (or decreases self-reported liberalism), and this effect is mediated by closed-mindedness. In Study 3, we manipulated closed-mindedness directly and found that high (vs. low) cognitive load results in a greater affinity for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party. Finally, in Study 4 we conducted an experiment involving political elites in Iceland and found that three different types of threat (to the self, group, and system) all led center-right politicians to score higher on closed-mindedness and issue-based political conservatism. Implications for society and for the theory of ideology as motivated social cognition are discussed.","Thorisdottir, Hulda and Jost, John T.",0,,1739
1747,Alive after Death: An Exploratory Cultural Artifact Analysis of the Merry Cemetery of Sapanta,"The paper uses insights from several Social Psychological theories to study the cultural artifacts of the Merry Cemetery ({MC}) of Sapanta (Romania). In the first study we have content analysed the epitaphs written on the painted crosses of the {MC} and the results show that the epitaphs reflect personal as well as social identity (in which individuals are described as members of both the family and the community) and play two important roles for the community members: they serve as a message to the dear ones and as an external memory of the community's social norms and shared worldview. The second study explored the social representation of the {MC} in the local community. The results show that the social representation of the {MC} clusters around three main themes: its symbolic, economic and local identity value.

See vol. 103, pg. 505, 2012)","In a series of studies, it is demonstrated that different types of self-affirmation procedures produce different effects. Affirming personally important values (value affirmation) increases self-clarity but not self-esteem. Affirming positive qualities of the self (attribute affirmation) increases self-esteem but not self-clarity (Study 1). As a consequence, attribute affirmation (which increases self-esteem) is more effective than value affirmation as a buffer against self-depreciating social comparison information. Attribute-affirmed participants more readily accept the self-evaluative consequences of threatening upward social comparisons than do value-affirmed participants (Study 2). However, value affirmation (which increases self-clarity) is a more effective buffer against dissonance threats. Value-affirmed participants showed less attitude change after writing a counterattitudinal essay than attribute-affirmed participants (Study 3).","Stapel, Diederik A. and van der Linde, Lonneke A. J.

1749,Climato-Economic Origins of Variation in Ingroup Favoritism,"Reflecting coping with threats to survival, national cultures differ in baseline levels of ingroup favoritism. These national baselines are mapped and explained in terms of inhabitants' cultural adaptations to climate-based demands and wealth-based resources. A 73-nation study of compatriotism-the social branch of patriotism-a 116-nation study of nepotism, and a 57-nation study of familism support the demands-resources explanation. Compatriotism, nepotism, and familism are strongest in lower-income countries with demanding cold or hot climates, moderate in countries with temperate climates irrespective of income per head, and weakest in higher-income countries with demanding cold or hot climates. Thus, cultural echos of climatic survival hold up across three distinct group conditions of genetic survival. Integration of the three measures provides a cross-disciplinary applicable index of baselines of cultural ingroup favoritism in 178 countries around the globe.","Van de Vliert, Evert",0,,1742
1750,"Interactions do not only tell us when, but can also tell us how: Testing process hypotheses by interaction","Hypotheses about psychological processes are often tested using traditional mediation analysis. This analysis relies on measurement of a transmitting variable. Conducting this analysis has become almost synonymous with examining process hypotheses. An alternative strategy to mediation analysis (the Testing-a-Process-hypothesis-by-an-Interaction Strategy, {TPIS}) is illustrated here. {TPIS} is based on a fully experimental design whereby a hypothesized process is tested by an interaction between the hypothesized cause of an effect and a contextual variable. In the interaction term, the contextual variable allows comparison of the causal effect observed when the process is uninterrupted to the effect observed when the process is interrupted. Thus, {TPIS} translates a theoretical process hypothesis into a statistical interaction hypothesis that uses a fully experimental design to directly examine the hypothesized process.

1751,To compete or to cooperate? Values' impact on perception and action in social dilemma games,"Two studies investigated how values affect competitive versus cooperative behavior. Each Study presented a new social-dilemma game, in which participants' interpretations of the dilemma (i.e., their subjective payoff matrix)-and consequently the dominant (i.e., rational) behavioral choice-depended on their values. The Paired Charity Game (Study 1) framed the situation in terms of cooperation. As hypothesized, contribution correlated positively with universalism and benevolence values that reflect concern for others and negatively with power, achievement, and hedonism values that promote self-interests. Furthermore, values, but not traits, predicted the participants' contribution. The Group Charity Game (Study 2) was designed to frame the situation in terms of competition. As hypothesized, contribution correlated positively with emphasizing benevolence over power values. Moreover, the impact of values was stronger when they were rendered accessible, indicating a causal influence of values on behavior. Furthermore, when their value hierarchy was rendered accessible, participants explained their choices in terms of those values that were (a) important to them and (b) relevant to the situation. The findings thus point to the mechanism through which accessible values affect behavior. Taken together, the studies promote our understanding of the value-behavior relationships, by highlighting the impact of values on perception.

1753,"Anger Toward God: Social-Cognitive Predictors, Prevalence, and Links With Adjustment to Bereavement and Cancer","Many people see themselves as being in a relationship with God and see this bond as comforting. Yet, perceived relationships with Clod also carry the potential for experiencing anger toward God, as shown here in studies with the U.S. population (Study 1), undergraduates (Studies 2 and 3), bereaved individuals (Study 4), and cancer survivors (Study 5). These studies addressed 3 fundamental issues regarding anger toward God: perceptions and attributions that predict anger toward God, its prevalence, and its associations with adjustment. Social-cognitive predictors of anger toward God paralleled predictors of interpersonal anger and included holding God responsible for severe harm, attributions of cruelty, difficulty finding meaning, and seeing oneself as a victim. Anger toward God was frequently reported in response to negative events, although positive feelings predominated. Anger and positive feelings toward God showed moderate negative associations. Religiosity and age correlated negatively with anger toward God. Reports of anger toward God were slightly lower among Protestants and African Americans in comparison with other groups (Study 1). Some atheists and agnostics reported anger involving God, particularly on measures emphasizing past experiences (Study 2) and images of a hypothetical God (Study 3). Anger toward God was associated with poorer adjustment to bereavement (Study 4) and cancer (Study 5), particularly when anger remained unresolved over a 1-year period (Study 5). Taken together, these studies suggest that anger toward God is an important dimension of religious and spiritual experience, one that is measurable, widespread, and related to adjustment across various contexts and populations.","Exline, Julie J. and Park, Crystal L. and Smyth, Joshua M. and Carey, Michael P.",0,,1745
1754,Imbuing Everyday Actions with Meaning in Response to Existential Threat,"Drawing on terror management theory and related perspectives on existential motivation, we hypothesized that people manage concerns with personal mortality by imbuing their everyday actions with abstract, self-relevant meaning. Accordingly, we found that subtle reminders of mortality led participants to view hypothetical actions at higher levels of action identification (Study 1), draw more connections between their current actions and personally significant long-term goals (Study 2), and perceive past actions as particularly influential in shaping their current self-concept (Study 3). These findings complement prior research, which has focused on the motivated defense of cultural worldviews, by showing how existential motivation shapes perceptions of even mundane personal actions.","L and au, Mark J. and Kosloff, Spee and Schmeichel, Br and on J.",0,,1746
1755,The Frog in Kierkegaard's Beer: Finding Meaning in the Threat-Compensation Literature,"Much existential philosophical theorizing and experimental psychological research is consistent with the notion that people experience arousal when committed beliefs are violated, and this prompts them to affirm other committed beliefs. People depend on meaning frameworks to make sense of their experiences, and when these expected associations are violated, the offending anomaly is often either assimilated into the existing meaning framework, or their meaning framework is altered to accommodate the violation. The meaning maintenance model proposes that because assimilation is often incomplete and accommodation demands cognitive resources, people may instead respond to anomalies by affirming alternative meaning frameworks or by abstracting novel meaning frameworks. Empirical evidence and theoretical implications are discussed.","Proulx, Travis and Heine, Steven J.",0,,1747
1756,The Cost of Self-Protection: Threat Response and Performance as a Function of Autonomous and Controlled Motivations,"Seventy-seven undergraduates, primed for autonomous or controlled motivation, were videotaped and physiologically monitored during a stressful interview and subsequent speech. Interview videotapes were coded for behavioral measures of threat response; speech videotapes were coded for performance. It was hypothesized that relative to controlled motivation, autonomous motivation would decrease interview threat response and enhance speech performance, and that threat response would mediate the effect of motivation on performance. Results support the prediction across measures of verbal, paralinguistic, smiling, vocal fundamental frequency, and cardiovascular response. Autonomously primed participants continued to show less cardiovascular threat throughout the later speech and gave better speeches. Finally, speech performance was mediated by interview threat response. Results demonstrate that relative to controlled motivation, autonomous motivation lowers threat response, which enhances performance.","Hodgins, Holley S. and Weibust, Kristin S. and Weinstein, Netta and Shiffman, Sara and Miller, Anita and Coombs, Garth and Adair, Kathryn C.",0,,1748
1757,Meaning-Making in Delayed-Return Cultures: The Case of Personal Uncertainty,"The large majority of humans nowadays live in cultures in which there is often a delay between the efforts they exert and the feedback they receive regarding the outcome of their efforts. As a result, individuals may experience uncertainty between their efforts and outcomes, leading them to pay special attention to uncertainty information. In particular, we propose that when people feel uncertain about themselves, this may be alarming to them as it may signal that their personal contract with their delayed-return culture may be in jeopardy. Therefore, under conditions of personal uncertainty, people are looking forward to events that bolster their cultural worldviews and detest events that violate these worldviews. We review research findings that show that personal uncertainty indeed has a special role in the social psychology of meaning-making and worldview defense, sometimes even yielding a better explanation of worldview defense reactions than terror management theory.","van den Bos, Kees and Martin, Leonard L. and Stapel, Diederik A.",0,,1749

This article shows that affective responses to disconfirmed expectancies depend on whether people value consistency and thus focus on the expectancy-congruency of the outcome or on its valence. People with high need for structure, a prevention focus, or for whom mortality is salient, assign more value to consistency and are more congruency focused:They feel more positive after congruent outcomes than after incongruent outcomes (independent of valence). People with low need for structure, a promotion focus, or for whom mortality is not salient, value consistency less and are more outcome focused:They feel more positive after positive outcomes than after negative outcomes (independent of congruency). This article furthermore shows how responses to the unexpected unfold and that a congruency focus requires less cognitive resources than an outcome focus.","Noordewier, Marret K. and Stapel, Diederik A.",0,,1750

This article proposes that this is partially the case because fundamentalist ideology provides a sense of consistency and closure. Outgroups that challenge the epistemic certainty that fundamentalism provides are rejected in an effort to protect this certainty. Results from two studies, including one using a nationally representative sample, found that the need for closure was related to fundamentalism and partially mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and the derogation of lesbians and gays (Study I) and value violators in general (Study 2). Furthermore, in Study 2, it was found that only some aspects of the need for closure explain the fundamentalism-prejudice relationship. Results are discussed in relation to past need for closure and ideology research as well as what this means for the study of fundamentalism.","Br and t, Mark J. and Reyna, Christine",0,,1751

The current paper however suggests that a subtle source of influence polling places themselves can impact voting behavior In two elections, people voting in churches were more likely to support a conservative candidate and a ban on same-sex marriage, but not the restriction of eminent domain. A field experiment found that people completing questionnaires in a chapel awarded less money (relative to people in a secular building) to insurance claimants seeking compensation for abortion pills, but not to worker's compensation claimants. A laboratory experiment found that people subliminally exposed to ecclesiastical images awarded less money (relative to people exposed to control images) to abortion pill claimants, but not to worker's compensation claimants. Exposure to ecclesiastical images affected only Christians; non-Christians' awards were unaffected by the prime. These findings show that polling locations can exert a powerful and precise influence on political attitudes and decision making.","Rutchick, Abraham M.",0,,1752
1761,The moderating role of extrinsic contingency focus on reactions to threat,"Over the last decade a number of theorists have advanced a multifaceted conceptualization of self-esteem. Central to this idea is the notion that self-esteem is less secure and more defensive when individuals are more focused on extrinsic contingencies. To test the hypothesis that individuals with high dispositional levels of extrinsic contingency focus ({ECF}) are insecure and respond defensively to threat, we developed a measure of {ECF} and conducted two validation studies. Study 1 showed that the extrinsic contingency focus scale ({ECFS}) was positively correlated with measures of defensiveness and was negatively correlated with measures of security and well-being. Study 2 showed that people with a high (vs. low) focus on extrinsic contingencies were more likely to defensively distance from a socially insensitive person following negative feedback about their own social sensitivity. Study 3 showed that when mortality (vs. dental pain) was salient, high {ECF} individuals responded more defensively toward a worldview violator than low {ECF} individuals. Discussion is focused on theoretical issues related to {ECF} and defensiveness.

They argue that religions have attributes that make them well suited to reduce feelings of self-uncertainty. According to uncertainty-identity theory, people are motivated to reduce feelings of uncertainty about or reflecting on self; and identification with groups, particularly highly entitative groups, is a very effective way to reduce uncertainty. All groups provide belief systems and normative prescriptions related to everyday life. However, religions also address the nature of existence, invoking sacred entities and associated rituals and ceremonies. They are entitative groups that provide a moral compass and rules for living that pervade a person's life, making them particularly attractive in times of uncertainty. The authors document data supporting their analysis and discuss conditions that transform religiosity into religious zealotry and extremism.","Hogg, Michael A. and Adelman, Janice R. and Blagg, Robert D.",0,,1755

1766,Exploring the roots of dehumanization: The role of animal-human similarity in promoting immigrant humanization,"Little is known about the origins of dehumanization or the mechanisms through which dehumanization impacts outgroup prejudice. We address these issues by measuring and manipulating animal-human similarity perceptions in a human intergroup context. As predicted, beliefs that animals and humans are relatively similar were associated with greater immigrant humanization, which in turn predicted more favorable immigrant attitudes (Study 1). Those higher in Social Dominance Orientation ({SDO}) or lower in Universal Orientation particularly rejected animal-human similarity beliefs, partially explaining their increased tendency to dehumanize and reject immigrants. In Study 2, perceptions of animal-human similarity were experimentally induced through editorials highlighting similarities between humans and other animals or emphasizing the human-animal divide. Emphasizing animals as similar to humans (versus humans as similar to animals, or the human-animal divide) resulted in greater immigrant humanization (even among highly prejudiced people). This humanization process facilitated more re-categorization (i.e., inclusive intergroup representations between immigrants and Canadians) and increased immigrant empathy, both of which predicted less prejudicial attitudes toward immigrants. Implications for research, theory, and interventions for dehumanization and prejudice are considered.","Costello, Kimberly and Hodson, Gordon",0,,1757
1767,The effects of mortality salience on political preferences: The roles of charisma and political orientation,"Research has shown that mortality salience ({MS}) heightens liking for certain political candidates. Yet the particular qualities that make candidates more appealing after {MS} has been subject to debate. This study tested three possibilities: {MS} increases liking for charismatic candidates independent of participants' or candidates' political orientation; {MS} increases liking for conservative candidates independent of participants' or candidates' political orientation; and {MS} increases liking only for charismatic candidates who support the individual's pre-existing political orientation, whether liberal or conservative. Following a {MS} manipulation, liberal and conservative participants evaluated two hypothetical gubernatorial candidates who differed both in their political orientation and level of charisma. {MS} heightened liking of charismatic candidates who shared the perceiver's political orientation, whether liberal or conservative. In contrast, {MS} reduced liking for uncharismatic and opposing-orientation candidates. Results thus indicated that {MS} heightens regard for same-political orientation charismatic candidates, rather than just any charismatic candidate or conservative candidates. Implications for the influence of death-related concerns on political preference are briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1768,On the Psychology of the Belief in a Just World: Exploring Experiential and Rationalistic Paths to Victim Blaming,"This article examines why people may blame innocent victims of robbery or sexual assault. We propose that in experiential mind-sets associative links are formed between the victim and the negative event. As the creation of such links is independent of explicit beliefs, people in experiential mind-sets produce negative reactions to the victim independent of their just-world beliefs. Rationalistic mind-sets, however, instigate propositional and consistency-based reasoning. For people who strongly endorse just-world beliefs (such as people who have strong predispositions to believe that the world is just or whose just-world beliefs have been threatened strongly), learning about an innocent victim creates a logically inconsistent system of beliefs. This inconsistency can be resolved by blaming the victim. For people who only weakly endorse just-world beliefs, there is no inconsistency in the first place and therefore no need to blame the victim. Two experiments support this line of reasoning.","van den Bos, Kees and Maas, Marjolein",0,,1759

1771,Effects of mortality salience aroused by threats against human identity on intergroup bias,"An experimental study on the effects of mortality salience aroused by threats against different components of the Self (personal, social and human identities) on intergroup bias is presented. It is hypothesised and found that the mortality salience per se does not inevitably led to increments of intergroup bias. This increment occurs when mortality salience is aroused by threats against personal or social identities. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.","Agustin, Echebarria-Echabe",1,,1762

In Study 1, participants in the {LTP} condition who were high in extrinsic value orientation ({EVC}) became less greedy in a raffle-ticket-taking task, making them as generous as intrinsic participants. Study 2 replicated this effect and demonstrated the effect was robust to alternative explanations. Study 3 examined value reports directly, finding that {LTP} participants evidenced reduced {EVO} and were less proself in a decomposed prisoner's dilemma. Results are considered via an integration of multiple lines of research including humanistic, life-span, social-cognitive, and existential perspectives, with the conclusion that a {LTP} can facilitate in certain individuals a reassessment and realignment of their value systems and behaviors.

Its individual, group and organizational aspects","This paper explorer psychological factors involved in terrorism and counterterrorism on individual, group and organizational levels of analysis. On the individual level, we describe attempts to understand terrorist behavior as a form of psychopathology, and/or as reflecting a unique constellation of personality traits. We also consider whether at the individual level there exists a uniform motivational basis for participating in terrorism. On the group level of analysis, we address the process of shared reality construction, social influence involved in recruitment of new members to terrorist organization, their indoctrination into terrorist ideology, and the use of language in creating terrorism warranting norms. On the organizational level we consider issuer of training, logistics and cost effectiveness as they apply to the decisions to launch terrorist activities, or abstain front their deployment. We conclude by considering the implications for our analysis for possible ways and means for countering terrorism.","Kruglanski, Arie W. and Fishman, Shira",0,,1764

1775,From psychology of terrorists to psychology of terrorism,"Terrorism as an act of violence involves a vast and multi-factorial network of sociopolitical causes. Yet this choice of action corresponds to another form of social violence. As psychologists, we can try to explain the consequences of terrorism, the reasons why terrorist groups always seem able to recruit new people for their purpose. It is also, perhaps, the link between these two issues which is even more interesting to explain. This paper offers a short review of past and contemporary hypotheses and research on terrorism in the field of psychology. More generally, this review considers international terrorism mainly perpetrated by radical Islamist fundamentalists. We will focus here on recent studies proposing that identity and, more specifically, social identity could be important factors in terrorism. Within these studies or reports, some point out the importance in contemporary terrorism of the threat that Western countries impute to Muslim and Arab identity As a conclusion, and in line with other authors, we introduce an integrative analysis framework for a vicious terror circle which begins with fear and threat, leads to the derogation of Muslim population in Western countries, and produces a fertile ground for the recruitment of terrorist sympathizers.","Arciszewski, Thomas and Verlhiac, Jean-Francois and Goncalves, Isabelle and Kruglanski, Abe",0,,1766
1776,Enemies Welcome: Personal Threat and Reactions to Outgroup Doves and Hawks,"Personal threat might hamper the resolution of intergroup conflicts involving terrorist violence by increasing stereotypic thinking towards outgroups associated with terrorism. This is indicated in research showing that existential personal threat elicits more positive evaluations of stereotype consistent and more negative evaluations of stereotype inconsistent outgroup members. In two experiments with Non-Muslim German participants we investigated the effects of both threats to existence and threats to control on reactions towards Muslim supporters (hawks, consistent with stereotype) and Muslim opponents of Islamist terrorism (doves, not consistent with stereotype). In line with our predictions we found decreased positive reactions towards doves following death salience in Study 1. Reduced positive evaluation of doves was also found as a tendency when lack of control was made salient in Study 2. In addition, salience of low control made negative reactions towards outgroup hawks less negative. The results illustrate a vicious circle of terrorist threat eliciting threats to personal life and control which in turn lead to the preservation of hostile outgroup stereotypes and thus intergroup conflict.","Fritsche, Immo and Koranyi, Nicolas and Beyer, Christiane and Jonas, Eva and Fleischmann, Beatrice",1,,1767

The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to this understudied research area. Drawing on related research and theory, we suggest that having influence over others serves five needs and/or goals-for accuracy, belongingness, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. Different types of social influence are compared and contrasted in the context of relevant dimensions of influence. We also make a number of suggestions for research to test this model.","Bourgeois, Martin J. and Sommer, Kristin L. and Bruno, Stefanie",0,,1768
1778,The life and death of creativity: The effects of mortality salience on self versus social-directed creative expression,"Research in terror management theory suggests that our connections to others function, in part, to provide protection from the anxiety associated with the awareness of inevitable death. The individuating nature of creative expression can potentially undermine these connections, making creativity particularly problematic when one is dealing with mortality concerns. Consistent with this, a number of findings have elucidated emotional consequences associated with creativity when mortality concerns are active. However, to date, research has not focused on how mortality awareness may impact levels of creativity. The present study assessed the hypothesis that mortality concerns will inhibit creative behavior that threatens social connections but will not undermine and may even facilitate creative behavior that bolsters social connections. The results showed that amplified concerns about mortality decreased creativity when the act was self-directed but not when it was community-directed. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.","Routledge, Clay and Arndt, Jamie and Vess, Matthew and Sheldon, Kennon M.",1,,1769

Study 1 found that people hold more favorable attitudes toward ingroup leaders (i.e. their own nation's leaders) when learning of negative actions of outgroup leaders (i.e. another nation's leaders). Study 2 replicated the finding, examining social identity strength as a moderator of this effect, and found that participants with strong national identification exhibit this intergroup leader-enhancement effect but participants with weak national identification do not. These data extend previous research on liking for leaders and are consistent with predictions derived from social identity theory.

1780,The nature of death and the death of nature: The impact of mortality salience on environmental concern,"According to terror management theory, individuals are motivated to distinguish themselves from the rest of nature because doing so facilitates the denial of human mortality. However, based on an integration of terror management and contingencies of self-worth perspectives, the present research hypothesized that existential insecurities about death may differentially influence environmental concern depending on whether or not an individual derives self-esteem from environmental action. Results demonstrated that heightened mortality awareness led to less concern for the environment among those not deriving self-esteem from an environmental domain, but fostered environmental concern among those who do acquire self-esteem from environmental action. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Vess, Matthew and Arndt, Jamie",1,,1771

Extensive research supporting this proposition has relied heavily on self-reports of group-based emotions. In three experiments, the authors provide converging evidence that group-based anger has subtle and less explicitly controlled consequences for information processing, using measures that do not rely on self-reported emotional experience. Specifically, the authors show that intergroup anger involves arousal (Experiment 1), reduces systematic processing of persuasive messages (Experiment 2), is moderated by group identification (Experiment 2, posttest), and compared to intergroup fear, increases risk taking (Experiment 3). These findings provide converging evidence that consistent with {IET}, emotions triggered by social categorization have psychologically consequential effects and are not evident solely in self-reports.","Rydell, Robert J. and Mackie, Diane M. and Maitner, Angela T. and Claypool, Heather M. and Ryan, Melissa J. and Smith, Eliot R.",0,,1772

Replicating findings from other East Asian samples, participants self-enhanced (i.e., regarded the self as superior to peers) more on collectivistic than individualistic attributes and assigned higher personal importance to the former than the latter. Moreover, better adjusted participants manifested a stronger tendency to self-enhance on personally important attributes. These data are consistent with the view that self-enhancement is a universal human motive that is expressed tactically and at odds with the assertion that self-enhancement is a uniquely Western phenomenon.","Gaertner, Lowell and Sedikides, Constantine and Chang, Kirk",0,,1773

The current research investigates the counterintuitive idea that people inhibit causal uncertainty immediately after its activation. We find that this inhibition weakens over time. Study I demonstrates this inhibition effect with self-report uncertainty. Study 2 demonstrates this effect with an implicit accessibility measure. Temporary inhibition of uncertainty may be a general response when uncertainty is activated. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1784,Identity motives and cultural priming: Cultural (dis)identification in assimilative and contrastive responses,"The present article explores whether effects of cultural primes are influenced by identity motives as well as by construct accessibility. The authors hypothesized that assimilative responses (shifting one's judgments toward the norm of the primed culture) are driven by identification motives, whereas contrastive responses (shifting away from this norm) are driven by disidentification motives. Evidence for this claim was attained in reanalyzes of past data sets and a new study of Chinese American biculturals, using improved measures of identification and disidentification motives. Consistent with the identity-motive hypotheses, assimilative responses to American-culture primes occurred for high (but not low) identifiers with American culture, and contrastive responses to Chinese-culture primes occurred for high (but not low) disidentifiers with Chinese culture. Results disconfirmed an alternative account predicting that contrast effects hinge on trait self-consciousness. Consistent with an accessibility saturation account, judgment patterns already heightened in accessibility by the task structure were not made more likely by priming. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Enhancement goals are likely to be more active in situations where intergroup competition or conflict is salient. If this is not the case, then a comprehension goal will predominate. In line with a why-determines-how logic, when mortality salience activates a comprehension goal, both positive and negative stereotyping occur. In contrast, the activation of an enhancement goal only increases negative stereotyping.","Renkema, Lennart J. and Stapel, Diederik A. and Maringer, Marcus and van Yperen, Nico W.",0,,1776

1788,A blast from the past: The terror management function of nostalgia,"According to terror management theory, people turn to meaning-providing structures to cope with the knowledge of inevitable mortality. Recent theory and research suggest that nostalgia is a meaning-providing resource and thus may serve such an existential function. The current research tests and supports this idea. In Experiments 1 and 2, nostalgia proneness was measured and mortality salience manipulated. In Experiment 1, when mortality was salient, the more prone to nostalgia participants were, the more they perceived life to be meaningful. In Experiment 2, when mortality was salient, the more prone to nostalgia participants were, the less death thoughts were accessible. In Experiment 3, nostalgia and mortality salience were manipulated. It was found that nostalgia buffered the effects of mortality salience on death-thought accessibility. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1789,Uncertainty and the influence of group norms in the attitude-behaviour relationship,"Two studies were conducted to examine the impact of subjective uncertainty on conformity to group norms in the attitude-behaviour context. In both studies, subjective uncertainty was manipulated using a deliberative mindset manipulation ({McGregor}, Zanna, Holmes, \& Spencer, 2001). In Study I (N = 106), participants were exposed to either an attitude-congruent or an attitude-incongruent in-group norm. In Study 2 (N = 83), participants were exposed to either a congruent, incongruent, or an ambiguous in-group norm. Ranges of attitude-behaviour outcomes, including attitude-intention consistency and change in attitude-certainty, were assessed. In both studies, levels of group-normative behaviour varied as a function of uncertainty condition. In Study 1, conformity to group norms, as evidenced by variations in the level of attitude-intention consistency, was observed only in the high uncertainty condition. In Study 2, exposure to an ambiguous norm had different effects for those in the low and the high uncertainty conditions. In the low uncertainty condition, greatest conformity was observed in the attitude-congruent norm condition compared with an attitude-congruent or ambiguous norm. In contrast, individuals in the high uncertainty condition displayed greatest conformity when exposed to either an attitude-congruent or an ambiguous in-group norm. The implications of these results for the role of subjective uncertainty in social influence processes are discussed.","Smith, Joanne R. and Hogg, Michael A. and Martin, Robin and Terry, Deborah J.",0,,1779

This phenomenon may occur in part as a means to justify, prior killing and so ease the threat of prior killing. In addition, this effect should arise particularly when a killer perceives similarity to the victims because similarity should exacerbate threat from killing. To examine these ideas, the authors developed a bug-killing paradigm in which the), manipulated the degree of initial bug killing in a ""practice task"" to observe the effects on subsequent self-paced killing during a timed ""extermination task. "" In Studies 1 and 2, for participants reporting some similarity to bugs, inducing greater initial killing led to more subsequent self-paced killing. In Study 3, after greater initial killing, more subsequent self-paced killing led to more favorable affective change. Implications for understanding lethal human violence are discussed.","Martens, Andy and Kosloff, Spee and Greenberg, Jeff and L and au, Mark J. and Schmader, Toni",0,,1780

Questionnaire measures demonstrated that people with stronger social ties had higher self-esteem, and that worldview validation did not account for this relationship. Further, belongingness and worldview validation were manipulated such that they pulled self-esteem in opposing directions, yet belongingness still influenced self-esteem. Participants had higher self-esteem after writing about social acceptance than rejection even though acceptance was accompanied by either failing to live up to an important value or having one's worldviews rejected. This latter effect was most pronounced among participants with high social anxiety. Results indicate that belongingness makes a unique contribution to self-esteem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

An Internet study (N = 1,529) and a laboratory experiment (N = 151) provide evidence for the hypothesis that salience of personal uncertainty concerns may lead people to react with more negative affective reactions toward extremely negative statements about religion, particularly when people are inclined to think of personal uncertainty as an emotionally threatening experience and when they are strongly religious.

This is done in an effort to distinguish cultural norms regarding social support (i.e., recognizing what counts as an effective message) from a sense of cultural efficacy in social support (i.e., the motivation to provide effective support) and furthermore, to link social support efficacy to individual differences associated with mental wellbeing and effective emotional management. Analyses indicate that evaluations of message sensitivity are predicted by cultural differences but not individual differences. In contrast, valuing specific interactive support goals was associated both with differences in distinction and belonging and the interaction between individual and cultural differences. The pattern of findings supports the conceptual distinctions between culturally appropriate and culturally efficacious dimensions of emotional support.","Mortenson, Steve and Liu, Meina and Burleson, Brant R. and Liu, Yan",0,,1786
1797,Looking to the future: How possible aged selves influence prejudice toward older adults,"Ageism is thought to be a unique form of prejudice due to the fact that humans change age group memberships as they age and grow old. The current research investigated how increasing the salience of their future aged selves would affect young adults' expressions of prejudice toward older adults. Taking a social identity approach, we hypothesized that young adults' identification with their current age group would moderate the effects of a future self exercise on ageism. In two studies, strongly identified young adults expressed less positive attitudes toward older adults after writing about themselves at 70, perhaps because thoughts of aged selves were threatening to them. Conversely, the future self exercise increased positive attitudes among weakly identified young adults in Study 2. Study 2 also demonstrated the effects of imagining a future self to be distinct from the effects of a perspective-taking exercise. The role of future social identity concerns in the expression of ageism is discussed.","Packer, Dominic J. and Chasteen, Alison L.",0,,1787

1799,Differences in Fear of Isolation as an explanation of Cultural Differences: Evidence from memory and reasoning,"Previous research suggests that members of East Asian cultures show a greater preference for dialectical thinking and sensitivity to context information than do Westerners. We suggest this difference is rooted in a greater chronic Fear of Isolation ({FOI}) in East Asians than in Westerners. To support this hypothesis, we manipulated {FOI} in a group of Westerners and assessed their relative preference for dialectical proverbs and sensitivity to context. For cross-cultural validation of our hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between chronic levels of {FOI} and dialectical reasoning in Koreans. Consistent with our proposal, both experimentally primed {FOI} (Experiment 1A and 2) and chronic levels of {FOI} (Experiment 1B) were positively related to relative preference for dialectical proverbs. This effect was independent of participants' level of negative mood (Experiment 2). A third experiment showed that sensitivity to context was affected by {FOI} in a manner consistent with previous studies of cultural differences (Experiment 3). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Terror management theory and close relationships seeking,"To cope with paralyzing terror awakened by thoughts of their own death people usually use two defense mechanisms: cultural worldview and self-esteem. Recent studies suggest that also close relationships may function as a death anxiety buffer. The present research explores this phenomenon in an experimental paradigm. One hundred sixteen undergraduates completed a self-esteem scale, attachment scale, and a scale tapping ideal mate characteristics. After experimental manipulation each participant talked shortly with six unknown students of the opposite sex and rated their attractiveness. The results showed no effect of self-esteem either in the experimental or control condition. As for the attachment styles, we obtained significant interaction of avoidance and condition (non-avoidant participants were more favorable under mortality salience), and simple effect of anxiety (anxious participants increased the assessments regardless of the condition).

1803,The meaning maintenance model: On the coherence of social motivations,"The meaning maintenance model ({MMM}) proposes that people have a need for meaning; that is, a need to perceive events through a prism of mental representations of expected relations that organizes their perceptions of the world. When people's sense of meaning is threatened, they reaffirm alternative representations as a way to regain meaning-a process termed fluid compensation. According to the model, people can reaffirm meaning in domains that are different from the domain in which the threat occurred. Evidence for fluid compensation can be observed following a variety of psychological threats, including most especially threats to the self such as self-esteem threats, feelings of uncertainty, interpersonal rejection, and mortality salience. People respond to these diverse threats in highly similar ways, which suggests that a range of psychological motivations are expressions of a singular impulse to generate and maintain a sense of meaning.","Heine, S.

In correspondence with predictions, two experiments show that reactions of people who have been informed about their intragroup status position (either low, average, or high) are influenced more strongly by voice as opposed to no-voice procedures than people who are not informed about their intragroup status. It is concluded that knowing where we stand in a group enhances reactions to procedural justice. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Van Prooijen, J. W. and Van den Bos, K. and Wilke, H. A.

We review diverse motivations that group membership may satisfy (e.g., the need for acceptance or ideological consensus) and attempt to link these particular needs to a global concern for self-worth. We then examine several factors hypothesized to influence an ingroup's utility in the eyes of its members. Attempting to unite our understanding of (a) why groups are needed and (b) what. kinds of groups are useful in meeting those needs, a proposed model of the ingroup as a social resource ({MISR}) suggests that the dimensions of perceived value, entitativity, and identification interact to determine the overall psychological utility of an ingroup.

Toward this end, the present studies examined whether increased fitness intentions could be used as both a direct defense against conscious concerns with death, but also as an indirect defense against unconscious death concerns among individuals for whom fitness is important to their self-esteem. In Study 1, both high and low fitness esteem participants responded to reminders of mortality with immediate exaggerated fitness intentions, relative to controls.

1809,"Terror management and the reactions to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001","How do we confront the finite nature of life? The paper is focussing on affective and cognitive consequences of the confrontation with death, especially on fear and anxiety. The recognition that extinction of my own existence can happen any time, is triggering off existential anxiety. Terror management theory of self-esteem is making predictions about the effects of the awareness of mortality. It is proposed that when mortality is made salient, individuals show positive reactions to those who support their cultural world views, and show negative reactions to those who threaten their beliefs. Own vulnerability and mortality was made salient to millions of people by the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington. Some public responses to the September 11th events will be described and explained from a terror management perspective.","Ochsmann, R.",0,,1798
1810,"I belong, therefore, I exist: Ingroup identification, ingroup entitativity, and ingroup bias","Merging insights from the intergroup relations literature and terror management theory, the authors conducted an experiment in which they assessed the impact of death-related thoughts on a series of ingroup measures. Participants in the mortality salience condition displayed stronger ingroup identification, perceived greater ingroup entitativily, and scored higher on ingroup bias measures. Also, perceived ingroup entitativily as well as ingroup identification mediated the effect of the mortality salience manipulation on ingroup bias. The findings are discussed in relation to theories of intergroup relations and terror management theory. A new perspective on the function of group belonging also is presented.","Castano, E. and Yzerbyt, V. and Paladino, M. P. and Sacchi, S.",0,,1799
1811,Proximal and distal defenses in response to reminders of one's mortality: Evidence of a temporal sequence,"The present study was designed to build on prim terror management research by testing the hypothesis that death-related thought first activates direct defenses to minimize the threat (proximal defense) and then later triggers symbolic cultural worldview defense (distal defense). After mortality salience, participants were either distracted from death-related thought or not and then completed either a measure of distal defense and then a measure of proximal defense or a proximal defense measure and then a distal defense measure. Results supported the authors' predictions. Proximal defense in the form of vulnerability denial emerged only when participants had immediately before been thinking about death, rn contrast, distal defense only emerged when participants were previously distracted from death-related thought. Discussion focuses on implications of these results for understanding the sequence of defenses initiated by mortality salience.","Greenberg, J. and Arndt, J. and Simon, L. and Pyszczynski, T. and Solomon, S.",0,,1800
1812,"Morality, family relations and mortality salience as determinants in the distribution of an estate",Terror management theory hypothesizes that when mortality is made salient Ss; would respond expecially negatively toward those who violate cultural values. Is this assumption also valid when a person leaves an inheritance to close relatives? In two methodically different experiments the prediction was tested that in this context mortality salience would reduce the relevance of moral behavior and enhance the importance of relationship. In both experiments Ss. were asked to put themselves in the position of a person who leaves an inheritance and to allocate ressources to two heirs. In the first experiment (N = 145) immoral behavior of male children by birth and male close relatives was punished less severely when mortality was made salient compared to a neutral condition. In the second experiment (N = 226) positive and negative moral behavior had no influence on the allocation to children by birth.;With nephews and nieces as potential heirs mortality salience reduced the otherwise large differences in allocations resulting from discrepancies in moral behavior.,"Bossong, B. and Kamkar, P.",0,,1801
1813,Anxiety in intergroup relations: A comparison of anxiety/uncertainty management theory and integrated threat theory,"In this article we review ,two theories in which anxiety and its relationship to intergroup relations play a central role: anxiety/uncertainty management ({AUM}) theory and the integrated threat theory ({ITT}) of prejudice. The antecedents and consequences of anxiety in each theory are presented and comparisons between the theories are drawn. {AUM} specifies a greater range of antecedents, while {ITT} specifies a greater range of threats. The theories differ in the conceptualizations of the effects of anxiety with {AUM} holding that anxiety typically has detrimental effects. {AUM} examines communication as the primary effect of anxiety whereas {ITT} focuses on prejudice. Possible reconciliations between the theories are discussed along with directions for future research. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.","Stephan, W. G. and Stephan, C.

1814,"Division of inheritances, moral behavior and facing mortality","The allocation of resources of a person who leaves an inheritance, e.g. by writing a will, leads to a confrontation with his or her mortality. Acording to Terror-Management-Theory this mortality salience should result in a harsher punishment of amoral behavior. But this leads to a conflict when the norm discrepant behavior is produced by children or close relatives, because thinking about them can also reduce death related anxiety. The study (N = 82 students and N = 162 Ss., 50 years and older) was designed to research how people are dealing with this conflict. Ss, were asked to put themselves into the position of a person who leaves an inheritance to two children and to rate 25 attributes (among them 6 amoral ones) to what extent they would lead to an increase oder decrease of the share. Mortality salience, compared to a neutral condition, produced a less severe punishment of amoral behavior but only among the elder Ss. The results support the assumption that in this context mortality salience can influence the relative weights of degree of relationship and amoral behavior.","Bossong, B.",1,,1803
1815,Perceived threat and authoritarianism,"There has been a long history of work on authoritarianism that has looked at the role of societal threat. Much of the empirical research in this tradition has relied on aggregate data to examine the relationship between societal threat and authoritarian attitudes and behaviors. Our analysis uses individual-level data and a range of perceived threat measures to better understand the dynamics of authoritarianism and threat. We also move beyond the hypothesis of a direct relationship between threat and authoritarianism, and hypothesize instead that the relationship involves interaction effects: societal threat activates authoritarian predispositions. As predicted, our analysis finds no evidence of a direct effect of societal threat but significant evidence of an interaction between authoritarian predispositions and perceived threat. We consider the implications of these, results for our understanding of authoritarianism.","Feldman, S. and Stenner, K.",0,,1804
1816,Predicting prejudice,"Three studies are reviewed that examine the correlates of prejudice. In the fir st two studies, it was hypothesized that prejudice toward national groups would be associated with an inner of stereotyping reflecting the strength and valence of the stereotypes of these groups. In both studies, the relationship between the stereotype/evaluation index and attitudes toward people from other countries supported this prediction. The third study examined the predictors of Americans' prejudice toward an immigrant group. In this study, it was found that realistic threats, value threats, and intergroup anxiety predicted prejudice toward Mexican immigrants. The findings from all three studies were integrated into a radial network model of intergroup cognitions and affect. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Stephan, W. G. and Stephan, C.

1817,{INDIVIDUAL}-{DIFFERENCES} {IN} {SENSITIVITY} {TO} {DISGUST} - A {SCALE} {SAMPLING} 7 {DOMAINS} {OF} {DISGUST} {ELICITORS},"We describe the development of a reliable measure of individual differences in disgust sensitivity. The 32-item Disgust Scale includes 2 true-false and 2 disgust-rating items for each of 7 domains of disgust elicitors (food, animals, body products, sex, body envelope violations, death, and hygiene) and for a domain of magical thinking (via similarity and contagion) that cuts across the 7 domains of elicitors. Correlations with other scales provide initial evidence of convergent and discriminant validity: the Disgust Scale correlates moderately with Sensation Seeking (r = -0.46) and with Fear of Death (r = 0.39), correlates weakly with Neuroticism (r = 0.23) and Psychoticism (r = -0.25), and correlates negligibly with Self-Monitoring and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Extraversion and Lie scales. Females score higher than males on the Disgust Scale. We suggest that the 7 domains of disgust elicitors all have in common that they remind us of our animality and, especially, of our mortality. Thus we see disgust as a defensive emotion that maintains and emphasizes the line between human and animal.","{HAIDT}, J. and {MCCAULEY}, C. and {ROZIN}, P.",0,,1806
1818,The Role of Death Anxiety and Self-Esteem in Suicide Attitudes,"The persistent stigmatization of suicide calls for a careful examination of the thought processes involved in perceptions of suicide. Hence, the present study is the first to apply terror management theory ({TMT}) and use experimental methods to examine whether reminders of death lead to increased stigma towards suicide and whether self-esteem moderates these stigmatized reactions. Consistent with the predicted effect of the death anxiety and self-esteem hypothesis, findings revealed that, for respondents with low self-esteem, thinking about their own death led to more stigma, less willingness to intervene, and allocated less money to a suicide prevention organization as compared to those who did not think about death. Findings from this study could have important implications for how we understand the psychological underpinnings of stigma and the role of death anxiety in hostile attitudes and decreased altruism - especially for mental health professionals working with individuals affected by suicide.","Kheibari, Athena and Cerel, Julie",1,,1807
1819,Journalistic Denial of Death during the Very First Traumatic Period of the Italian {COVID}-19 Pandemic,"Exactly one year ago, between February and March 2020, the {COVID}-19 infection went from an epidemic confined to China to a worldwide pandemic that was particularly lethal in Italy. This study examined the media accounts during that period by analysing the representation of death-related constructs in Corriere della Sera, the most widely read newspaper in Italy. A textual and thematic analysis of articles published between period A (epidemic: 23 January-22 February 2020) and period B (pandemic: 23 February-31 March 2020) was conducted using Nvivo-11. A total of 141 articles comprising 48,524 words were collected. The most utilised words and meanings linked to {COVID}-19 were computed. In the rank distribution, 'China' and 'virus' were the terms most frequently used in both periods. The terms 'death' and 'dead' were completely absent in period A and appeared in the 535th position in period B. The term 'dead' was used primarily to indicate the number of deceased. From a Terror Management Theory perspective, it is possible that the minimal reference to death-related issues was a reflection of death denial and a manifestation of efforts to deny death to manage terror. These findings highlight the ambiguities and ambivalence surrounding any issue pertaining to death; on the one side, undue alarmism may provoke exaggerated reactions, such as moral panic, while on the other denial-based messages that minimise references to mortality may reduce safe behaviour during a pandemic.","Solomon, Sheldon and Rostellato, Daniele and Testoni, Ines and Calabrese, Fiorella and Biasco, Guido",0,,1808
1820,"Examining the Complex Relation Among Religion, Morality, and Death Anxiety: Religion Can Be a Source of Comfort and Concern Regarding Fears of Death","This study examined the relationship among religiosity, morality, and fear of death. Students (n = 328, 75\% women, M-age = 18.9) completed measures of fear of death, frequency of immoral behavior, discrepancy between ideal and actual religious practices, strength of religious beliefs, views of God as punishing or forgiving, and behavior efficacy (the extent to which fate in the afterlife was perceived to be determined by behavior in this life). Frequency of immoral behavior was not related to fears of death, but both strength of religious views and behavior efficacy were negatively correlated with fears of death. In contrast, perceived failure to live up to religious standards was associated with more death anxiety, especially among those with punishing views of God. These findings support the idea that some aspects of religion can help protect people from death anxiety, whereas other aspects of religion can exacerbate fears of death.","Bassett, Jonathan F. and Bussard, Mel L.",0,,1809
1821,International mega-corruption Inc.: the structural violence against sustainable development,"Purpose This paper aims to determine the underlying structural foundations that explain why mega (large-scale) corruption exists in an ever-more sophisticated form and how and why the phenomenon remains an intractable threat to global socio-economic stability and sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach Post-colonial theory is used along with critical perspectives on corruption in international business. The paper privileges the decolonization of the current paradigm where ""hegemonic orthodoxy"" is maintained and enforced through domesticated criticism of corruption in academic literature and in the media. Findings The author explains the foundations of ""International mega-Corruption Incorporated"" ({ImC} Inc.) and conclude that apart from being the results of greed and criminal intent, it is a designed and weaponized violent instrument for undermining human progress. {ImC} Inc. occurs through resource control and the manipulation of institutions. Thus, the same theories, the same analyses and the same media exposes on the ""pandemic of {ImC} Inc."" are followed by the same inactions or lacklustre interventions that ignore the powerful international financial institutions serving as the major facilitators. Social implications The nature of {ImC} Inc. as an existential threat requires mass awareness about its historicity and deep-seated influence on institutions, in order for stakeholders to form a countervailing power to proactively disrupt it in its complexity and in contextually meaningful ways. Originality/value This paper provides useful clarifications about specific factors that determine how {ImC} Inc. exists and thrives in its current form and how to deploy sweeping, corrective and pre-emptive interventions rather than reactionary policies against {ImC} Inc.","Ahen, Frederick",0,,1810
1822,Memories of a Death Threat: Negative Consequences of Unconscious Thoughts About a Terrorist Attack on Attitudes Towards Alcohol,"Based on the terror management health model ({TMHM}), we examined the impact of terrorist attacks as reminders of death on implicit alcohol-related attitudes, including the moderating role of conscious death-related thoughts and alcohol-based self-esteem ({ABS}). With an online experiment (N = 487), we analyzed how thoughts and memories about a recent terrorist attack unconsciously (with a delay task) and consciously (without a delay task) affected implicit alcohol-related attitudes. We found that such thoughts increased the death-thought accessibility. While no main effect of the salience of the terrorist attack on alcohol-related attitudes existed, respondents with low {ABS} had more positive attitudes, when unconsciously thinking about the attack as compared to the control group. Respondents with high {ABS} in the delay task had lower alcohol-{IAT} scores. Overall, this study provides evidence that thoughts about terrorism that can be provoked through media affect alcohol-related attitudes. Such attitudes may cause negative health consequences through health-related decisions.","Pradel, Franziska and Sattler, Sebastian",1,,1811
1823,"""Out of the Depths Have I Called Thee"": Jewish Israeli Undertakers' Management of Death Anxiety","According to Terror Management Theory, there are three common buffers that minimize the anxiety of mortality salience: affirmation of one's cultural worldview, the self and one's personal values, and one's significance in the context of close personal relationships. The current study aimed to explore the manner by which Jewish Israeli undertakers manage their constant exposure to death and buffer against death anxiety. A deductive and inductive thematic analysis captured a dialectical movement between, and within, two conflicting worldviews participants were engaged in, in their attempt to manage the mortality salience effect they experience and buffer against death anxiety.","Mahat-Shamir, Michal",0,,1812

Death anxiety and psychological distress were examined in the context of work status. A sample of 478 from the general population voluntarily participated in the study. Findings revealed a significant moderating role of work status, illustrating the strong relationship between psychological distress and death anxiety for non-working participants. Therefore, psychological distress is related to more significant death anxiety among non-working than those who are working. This study highlights the importance of work as an anxiety buffering factor concerning mortality thoughts.","Shakil, Muneeba and Ashraf, Farzana and Muazzam, Amina and Amjad, Maryam and Javed, Saba",0,,1813
1825,I can see myself helping: The effect of self-awareness on prosocial behaviour,"Many studies indicate that increasing self-awareness leads to individuals reflecting on their values and ideals (Silvia \& Duval, 2001). This self-reflection appears to increase prosocial behaviour (Berkowitz, 1987). However, previously studies typically manipulated self-awareness in situations in which the individual may have felt pressure from the researcher to help. Thus, experimenter pressure to behave prosocially confounds the self-awareness explanation provided in past research. We used a novel experimental paradigm to manipulate self-awareness and remove the researcher's presence to decrease the likelihood that the participant would conform to experimenter demand. Participants were 36 college students (M-age = 19.52; 25 women). The results indicated a strong probability that the experimental condition participants were more prosocial than control condition participants. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that self-reflection increases prosocial behaviour, even without experimenter demands. These findings and the importance of studying objective self-awareness in light of the coronavirus are discussed.","Lewis, Jerome Anthony and Himmelberger, Zachary M. and Elmore, J. Dean",0,,1814
1826,"Memorable, Meaningful, Pleasurable: An Exploratory Examination of Narrative Character Deaths","The current manuscript presents a study that examines contextual factors that can explain two distinct types of viewer responses to death in narratives. Using procedures developed in past research, we explore why some narrative character deaths elicit poignant, eudaimonic responses while others elicit joyful, hedonic responses. We incorporate a control group to examine whether freely-recalled memorable deaths are more closely associated with feelings of meaning or pleasure. Results suggest that meaningful deaths lead to appreciation; befall liked, moral characters; and elicit mixed/negative affect, whereas pleasurable deaths lead to enjoyment; befall disliked, immoral characters, and elicit positive affect. In addition, freely-recalled character death is more closely aligned with meaningful death and its correlates than pleasurable death and its correlates. We conclude with a discussion of how the current findings can improve the use of mediated death in clinical settings, particularly as a strategy for approaching instances of disenfranchised grief.","Fitzgerald, Kaitlin and Francemone, C.

1827,Contrasting the Effects of Mortality Salience and Future Time Limitation on Goal Prioritization in Older {andYounger} Adults,"Objectives: This study aims at contrasting the effects of limited future time perspective and mortality salience on goal prioritization across adulthood. Socioemotional selectivity theory ({SST}) argues that people increasingly prioritize emotionally meaningful goals when they perceive future time as more limited. Terror management theory ({TMT}) suggests that mortality salience (i.e., the awareness of one's mortality) drives people to prioritize the goal of perpetuating own existence through affirming cultural worldview. Method: In this study, participants (N = 438) were randomly assigned to six conditions that primed (a) limited future time, (b) mortality salience, (c) death reflection, (d) both limited future time and mortality salience, (e) both limited future time, and death reflection, or (f) none. Results: Results showed that older adults allocated significantly more resources to emotionally close recipients who supported their cultural worldviews in conditions involving future time limitation and death reflection. They also allocated less resources to emotionally not close recipients who did not support their cultural worldviews in conditions involving future time limitation. Younger adults did not show these differences. Nor did mortality salience have any effect. Discussion: These results suggest that future time perspective and death reflection shift age-related goals more than mortality salience.","Fung, Helene H. and Chu, Steven Tsun-Wai and Jiang, Da and Chen, Amber Xuqian and Ng, Carson Chuen",1,,1816
1828,Exploring the Motivation Behind Discrimination and Stigmatization Related to {COVID}-19: A Social Psychological Discussion Based on the Main Theoretical Explanations,"The novel coronavirus ({COVID}-19), was first detected in Wuhan province in China during late December 2019 and was designated as being highly infectious. The World Health Organization ({WHO}) labeled it a ""pandemic"" on March 11, 2020. Throughout human history, experience has shown that prejudices and viruses spread simultaneously during a viral pandemic. Outgroup members have been associated with various diseases and non-human vectors of diseases. Some epidemics have been named according to various outgroups, just as the novel coronavirus has been referred to by some as the ""Wuhan virus"" or the ""Chinese virus."" Associating a virus with a sociodemographic group builds a false illusionary correlation, which can lead to stigmatization and discrimination. Pandemics can also stimulate violent xenophobic reactions. Besides the obvious harmful consequences for the individuals targeted, pandemic-related discrimination also affects the spread of the virus through its effect on public attitudes toward prevention and restriction, health service procurement, and in the establishment of health-related policies. It is important to first understand the relevant concepts and processes, and also to understand the underlying causes of discrimination in order to fight it. Social psychology offers multidimensional and comprehensive explanations of prejudice and discrimination. This review's primary aim was to examine the motivations behind {COVID}-19-related discrimination based on social psychological perspectives. In line with this aim, the review first defines discrimination in detail, plus the related concepts and main social psychological theories on prejudice and discrimination. Then, pandemic-related discrimination in light of past experiences is discussed and explanations put forward for the theoretical perspectives and inferences specific to {COVID}-19. Finally, recommendations are made in order to prevent and combat discrimination related to infectious diseases.","Demirtas-Madran, H. Andac",0,,1817
1829,Managing an existential threat: how a global crisis contaminates organizational decision-making,"Purpose The paper introduces a new model, the evolutionary-existential model of organizational decision-making. The purpose of the model is to provide an empirical framework for understanding the context for decision-making under conditions of existential threat to organizations, such as the global {COVID}-19 pandemic during the year 2020. Design/methodology/approach The model is built on an extensive interdisciplinary literature review, drawing from research in social psychology, management, behavioral economics, evolutionary psychology and consumer behavior. In general, the authors follow Bargal's (2006) call for action research in the spirit of Lewin (1951). Findings According to the model, organizational decision-making during the pandemic threat is influenced by (1) existential threat and (2) an unprecedented macroenvironmental context for decision-making. The authors argue that these psychological and macroenvironmental forces may lead to suboptimal decision-making, based on (1) their basic cognitive architecture and (2) specific evolutionary triggers activated by the pandemic. The authors highlight how the interaction between these inputs and the decision context manifest in various social psychological phenomena that are known to impact judgments and decisions. Practical implications Simply put, the magnitude and the urgency of the global pandemic call for new and integrative ways of understanding organizational decision-making. Originality/value The model is new. Although the authors draw on prior research and theory, the model is uniquely interdisciplinary; further, the authors are able to make specific and unique predictions about the inputs, decision context and their social-psychological consequences for decision-making.","Norris, J.

This field study was conducted in Malang, Indonesia. The findings disclose that both mortality salience and self-esteem increase materialism. Materialism is found to intensify consumers' sustainability attitudes of green concern and consumer social responsibility ({CnSR}). It is also found that religiosity strengthens the effect of mortality salience on materialism and that of materialism on {CnSR}. Contrarily, religiosity weakens the effects of materialism on green concern. However, there is no statistical support for the moderating effect of religiosity on the linkage between self-esteem and materialism.","Rahimah, Anni and Khalil, Shadab and Dang, Huu Phuc and Cheng, Julian Ming-Sung",1,,1819

Additionally, advertising increasingly depicts other controversial topics, such as sex and violence, but not death. Is death the last taboo in advertising? This qualitative study uses a grounded theory approach to explore death as a taboo topic in advertising through in-depth interviews with twenty consumers-purposively chosen so that half of the participants were aged in their 20 s and half were older than 65. Participants were shown six current, non-shocking ads containing death portrayals to understand how consumers think and feel about death portrayals in advertising. Differences in consumer interpretations based on age emerged. In addition, ad execution factors that helped consumers accept death portrayals included the use of humor, non-human characters, unrealistic situations, and evocative music.","Caulfield, Jane and Day, Michelle and Phillips, Barbara J.",0,,1820
1832,Just-World Beliefs Increase Helping Intentions via Meaning and Affect,"Our research examines the relationship between just-world beliefs and helping. Specifically, we pose that the belief in just world increases helping intentions via perceptions of meaning in life. Consistently, across two studies we found that higher levels of just-world beliefs corresponded with stronger helping intentions. In Study 1, individual differences in just-world beliefs correlated positively with helping intentions. In Study 2, experimentally induced higher (vs. lower) levels of just-world beliefs led to stronger intentions to help others. In both studies, we found that the presence of meaning in life mediated the effects of just-world beliefs on helping intentions, indicating that these prosocial effects of just-world beliefs are established through the impression that life is meaningful. We further found that positive affect plays a mediational role in these effects by linking the perceptions of meaning to helping intentions. This research provides insights into the socially desirable consequences of just-world beliefs by highlighting the crucial roles of existential appraisals and affective states.","Igou, Eric R. and Blake, Aidan A. and Bless, Herbert",0,,1821
1833,Nostalgia decreases green consumption: The mediating role of past orientation,"Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for one's past, can influence consumption behavior. The present research investigates how nostalgia affects green consumption. Specifically, we propose that high nostalgia, chronic or primed, can lower consumers' preference for green (vs regular) products. Results across four studies show that high-nostalgia consumers have lower preference for green products compared with low-nostalgia consumers. This effect is mediated by past orientation, such that high-nostalgia consumers tend to dwell on the past, which brings preference to the older products, usually regular rather than green ones that have future connotations, they grew up with. In addition, we find that mortality salience ({MS}) moderates the effect of nostalgia on green product preference, such that the negative effect of nostalgia on the preference for green products would be enhanced (vs mitigated) when {MS} is high (vs low). Implications for research and practice are discussed. {JEL} {CLASSIFICATION} M3","Wang, Xuehua and Chao, Chen-Ho",1,,1822
1834,"Between Conspiracy Beliefs, Ingroup Bias, and System Justification: How People Use Defense Strategies to Cope With the Threat of {COVID}-19","The current situation around coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) portrays a threat to us in several ways: It imposes uncertainty and a lack of control and reminds us of our own mortality. People around the world have reacted to these threats in seemingly unrelated ways: From stockpiling yeast and toilet paper to favoring nationalist ideas or endorsing conspiratorial beliefs. According to {theGeneral} Process Model of Threat and Defense, the confrontation with a threat - a discrepant experience - makes humans react with both proximal and distal threat responses. While the proximal response manifests in behavioral inhibition that leads to heightened anxious arousal and vigilance, distal responses seek to lower behavioral inhibition and the associated state of anxiety and vigilance through engaging in distal defenses. In the present research, we propose that the reactions to {COVID}-19 may represent distal defense strategies to the pandemic and, therefore, can be explained and forecasted by the model. Thus, we hypothesized increased perceived {COVID}-19 threat to lead to a proximal threat response in the form of heightened behavioral inhibition. This, in return, should enhance the use of distal defenses (i.e., several ingroup biases, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs) overlapping with the reactions observed as a response to {COVID}-19. This hypothesized mediated effect of increased perceived {COVID}-19 threat on distal defenses was tested in two preregistered studies: In Study 1 (N= 358), results showed perceived {COVID}-19 threat to be related to behavioral inhibition and, in turn, to be associated with increased distal defenses (i.e., higher entitativity, control restoration motivation, passive party support). In Study 2 (N= 348), we manipulated {COVID}-19 threat salience and found results suggesting the distal defenses of ingroup entitativity, system justification, and conspiratorial beliefs to be mediated by the proximal threat response. The results of the present research hint toward a common mechanism through which the seemingly unrelated reactions to {COVID}-19 can be explained. The results might help to predict future behavior during the {COVID}-19 pandemic and to design measures to counteract the detrimental effects of the pandemic.","Jutzi, Chiara A. and Willardt, Robin and Schmid, Petra C. and Jonas, Eva",0,,1823
1835,For the Greater Good? The Devastating Ripple Effects of the Covid-19 Crisis,"As the crisis around Covid-19 evolves, it becomes clear that there are numerous negative side-effects of the lockdown strategies implemented by many countries. Currently, more evidence becomes available that the lockdowns may have more negative effects than positive effects. For instance, many measures taken in a lockdown aimed at protecting human life may compromise the immune system, and purpose in life, especially of vulnerable groups. This leads to the paradoxical situation of compromising the immune system and physical and mental health of many people, including the ones we aim to protect. Also, it is expected that hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger and postponed medical treatments. Other side effects include financial insecurity of billions of people, physical and mental health problems, and increased inequalities. The economic and health repercussions of the crisis will be falling disproportionately on young workers, low-income families and women, and thus exacerbate existing inequalities. As the virus outbreak and media coverage spread fear and anxiety, superstition, cognitive dissonance reduction and conspiracy theories are ways to find meaning and reduce anxiety. These behavioral aspects may play a role in the continuance of lockdown decisions. Based on theories regarding agnotology (i.e., the ways ignorance or doubt about certain topics is created by means of withholding or presenting information in a certain way), social influence, superstition and stress and coping, I seek to explain the social and behavioral aspects of human behavior in times of crises. Both the Covid-19 crisis itself as well as the resulting economic and (mental) health crisis are global problems that may require global solutions. I present a model of drivers and outcomes of lockdown behaviors and offer suggestions and a tool to counteract the negative psychological effects by means of online life crafting therapeutic writing interventions.","Schippers, Michaela C.",0,,1824
1836,Caught in the crossfire: reactions to persistent mortality salience,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to draw on terror management theory ({TMT}) to explore the impact of pervasive mortality cues on consumer behaviour as a result of residing in a community ravaged by escalating violence. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative analysis of 27 in-depth interviews of consumers living in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico during the height of the Mexican drug war provides insight into their coping strategies and consumption. Findings Living under such conditions results in unrelenting mortality salience ({MS}), as well as the adoption of consumption-related coping strategies that can conflict with cultural worldviews and threaten self-esteem. The normalization of coping strategies severely strains worldviews. Consumers manage their ensuing intrapersonal evaluative tension by developing consumption safe havens and through identity fragmentation. Moreover, permanent proximal defences result from persistent {MS}. Research limitations/implications Although cross-sectional and idiosyncratic to the Mexican culture, the findings broaden {TMT} by suggesting that consumers facing relentless {MS} experience altered brand meanings and social interactions, as they were reluctant to acquire prestige brands, while indicating an increase in the value placed on relationships over possessions. Practical implications Marketers can help consumers alleviate their death-related anxiety by eliminating telemarketing campaigns, promoting online shopping, using unique customer identification numbers and investing in visible security measures such as gates, security cameras, and guards. Originality/value This exploratory study provides a preliminary theoretical framework for consumers' reactions to persistent {MS}.","Jimenez, Fern and o R. and Ramirez, Edward and Diaz, Art",0,,1825
1837,Terror Management Theory and the {COVID}-19 Pandemic,"Terror management theory is focused on the role that awareness of death plays in diverse aspects of life. Here, we discuss the theory's implications for understanding the widely varying ways in which people have responded to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We argue that regardless of whether one consciously believes that the virus is a major threat to life or only a minor inconvenience, fear of death plays an important role in driving one's attitudes and behavior related to the virus. We focus on the terror management theory distinction between proximal defenses, which are activated when thoughts of death are in current focal attention and are logically related to the threat at hand, and distal defenses, which are activated when thoughts of death are on the fringes of one's consciousness and entail the pursuit of meaning, personal value, and close relationships. We use this framework to discuss the many ways in which {COVID}-19 undermines psychological equanimity, the diverse ways people have responded to this threat, and the role of ineffective terror management in psychological distress and disorder that may emerge in response to the virus.","Pyszczynski, Tom and Lockett, {McKenzie} and Greenberg, Jeff and Solomon, Sheldon",0,,1826
1838,Impact of the perceived threat of {COVID}-19 on variety-seeking,"The {COVID}-19 pandemic has significantly influenced our daily and social lives as well as our consumption patterns. This paper focuses on the relationship between the {COVID}-19 threat and variety-seeking. Based on several theories, including reactance theory and terror management theory, we predict that the perceived threat of {COVID}-19 will increase the tendency to choose more and different options in multiple choice settings. Firstly, two empirical studies demonstrate that variety-seeking in food and stationery choices is enhanced as people's perceived threat from the disease increases. Study 3 further suggests the boundary conditions of the above pattern in that the type of decision (i.e., multiple option selections across different brands vs. within the same brand) will moderate the impact of the perceived threat on variety-seeking. Specifically, when the decision involved choice across different brands, participants showed higher variety-seeking under high (vs. low) perceived threat. However, the opposite pattern was true when the decision involved choice within the same brand. This research offers a deeper understanding of how variety-seeking can be changed by the perceived threat of {COVID}-19. (C) 2020 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.

1839,Improving Evacuation Compliance through Control: Implications for Emergency Management Policy and Disaster Communications,"Federal and local emergency management agencies and policymakers often ask: Why do individuals refuse to leave their homes when emergency evacuations are mandated during life-threatening natural disasters? In three experimental studies, the current research establishes that during a natural disaster, individuals become aware of their mortality. Existential anxiety is high and a need for control is instantiated. This makes following the directive to evacuate relatively less appealing. If, however, individuals can meet their need for control while in the process of making the evacuation decision (e.g., choice of shelter), the likelihood of evacuating increases. In light of increasing concerns related to global climate change, terrorist threats, pandemics, and other natural disasters, calls for more interdisciplinary work in understanding human decision-making in emergency situations have been made. The current work has timely implications for emergency management agencies, policymakers, and those required to communicate during natural disasters.","Atalay, A.

1840,Benefits of heroes to coping with mortality threats by providing perceptions of personal power and reducing unhealthy compensatory consumption,"Mortality threats are among the strongest psychological threats that an individual can encounter. Previous research shows that mortality threats lead people to engage in unhealthy compensatory consumption (i.e., overeating), as a maladaptive coping response to threat. In this paper, we propose that reminders of heroes when experiencing mortality threat increases perceptions of personal power, which in turn buffers the need to engage in unhealthy compensatory consumption. We test and find support for our predictions in a series of four studies that include real-world Twitter data after a series of terrorist attacks in 2016-2017, and three experimental studies conducted online and in the field with behavioral measures after Day of the Dead and during {COVID}-19 pandemic. These findings advance the literature on compensatory consumption, mortality threats, and the psychological functions of heroes.","Ulqinaku, Aulona and Sarial-Abi, Gulen and Kinsella, Elaine L.",1,,1829
1841,In the Valley of the Shadow of Death: Insecurity and Miraculous Experiences,"Experiencing a miracle is often assumed to be predicated on a lack of rational, scientific explanations of phenomena as measured with education or class. Existential threat theories would predict religious experiences are not directly related to these measures of modernization, but rather the economic and political stability that accompanies modernization. Those who experience threats to their existence are more likely to experience miracles. I investigate the prevalence of miracles in Latin American using a 2013 Pew survey of religious beliefs and experiences. Looking at 15,400 respondents from 16 separate countries, I analyze the extent to which experiencing miracles is correlated with education, {SES}, financial insecurity, cultural traditionalism, and several religious variables. I find education and {SES} have little correlation with the number of miracles experienced, financial insecurity is positively correlated with experiencing miracles, and Protestants have more divine encounters than Catholics. This suggests that both religious socialization and existential threat explain why individuals experience miracles.","Eschler, Edwin",0,,1830
1842,Educational Applications of Buddhist Meditations on Death,"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ({MBSR}) is applied in various fields such as medicine, cognitive science, business, and education. The mindfulness of Buddhism is at the center of {MBSR}, and this means that Buddhist meditation has a great effect on modern society. For Buddhist meditations on death, {theAnguttara} Nikayasuggests mindfulness of death (mara?asati), referring to ten methods of mindfulness and meditation on impurity (asubhanupassin), which are expounded in {theDigha} Nikaya. In this article, I explore two meditations on death that could have a positive effect if applied to an area of education like {MBSR}. Through numerous experiments, terror management theory ({TMT}) has proved that many positive psychological changes occur when human beings contemplate death. {TMT} argues that when mortality salience is triggered, psychological changes occur, such as considering internal values, such as the meaning of life and happiness, or increasing the frequency of carrying out good deeds for others, rather than focusing on external values (e.g., wealth, fame, and appearance). The educational application of Buddhist meditations on death is used in the same context and has a similar purpose to {TMT}. In addition, I discuss that meditations on death also have the effect of cultivating ""the power of acceptance for death"", which is gained by everyone, including those who practice and their loved ones. For educational applications of meditations on death, the mindfulness of death is related to death and temporality, and meditation on impurity can be applied by using death-related images. Moreover, based on the duration of a session and the training time per session, I note that these methods can be applied only to meditation or mixed with the content of death-related education, for example, the meaning of death, the process of dying, near-death experiences, and grief education.","Moon, Hyun Gong",0,,1831
1843,"Examining Belief in a Just World, Religious Worldviews, and Self-Esteem Within the Framework of Terror Management Theory: Mortality Salient and Nonmortality Salient Organizations","To sustain their lives has always been the main motivation of all the creatures, especially human beings. Just as there is always beginning of life, there is also an end of it for all living species. Human being is the only species that is aware of their mortality. According to terror management theory ({TMT}), this awareness causes some sort of anxiety. Human being, by their nature, do not want to be worried and want to cope with the anxiety in different ways. This study aims to test belief in a just world, religious worldviews, and self-esteem within the framework of {TMT} hypotheses in both mortality salient (n = 104) and nonmortality salient (n = 102) organizations. In each organization, half of the participants were reminded about death (experimental condition) and the other half about toothache (control condition). The required data for this study were collected by utilizing Life Satisfaction Scale, The Multidimensional Mortality Awareness Measure, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Belief in a Just World Scale, Self-Esteem Scale, Religious Worldviews Scale, and personal information form. Results indicated that there are no significant differences for self-esteem and religious worldviews between mortality salient and nonmortality salient samples, whereas there are significant mean differences for personal/general belief in a just world. The findings of this study are discussed within the framework of {TMT} literature.","Bulut, Meryem B.",0,,1832
1844,"An Integrated Review of Recent Research on the Relationships Between Religious Belief, Political Ideology, Authoritarianism, and Prejudice","Religious ideology and extremism have had an increasing influence on political agendas in the United States and much of the developed world in the past 60 years, with right-wing ideology becoming more prevalent this decade. This article serves as a review of studies investigating the correlations between political ideology, religiosity, right-wing authoritarianism, ingroups/outgroups, and prejudice in an attempt to describe and understand the well-established links between these dimensions. We discuss several group-level theories including Terror Management Theory, Social Identity Theory, Realistic Group Conflict Theory among others to frame the intercorrelations of these constructs in an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms that drive individuals to embody religious and political beliefs. We then discuss individual-level cognitive and psychological differences such as intelligence, cognitive flexibility, and specific biological and neurological limitations of brain function that may influence people to adopt certain religious and political beliefs. Through a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of religious and political extremism, we may be better equipped to assuage the fear and denigration that is associated with many of these beliefs.","Cuevas, Joshua A. and Dawson, Bryan L.",0,,1833

A total of 462 Israeli adults, average age 57 years, completed scales measuring subjective nearness-to-death, negative attitudes toward people with disability, and attachment patterns. High levels of subjective nearness-to-death were associated with negative attitudes toward people with disability, and attachment patterns were significant moderators. Findings point to the theoretical importance of both perceptions of death and personal resources for coping with subjective nearness-to-death in relation to attitudes toward individuals with disabilities.","Koren, Ela and Shrira, Amit and Bodner, Ehud and Bergman, Yoav S.",0,,1834
1846,The Role of Religious Orientation in Worldview Conflict,"Worldview conflict is a regular part of life. We typically encounter information that disagrees with or disconfirms the way we understand and make sense of the world. People usually respond negatively to such experiences; however, do responses depend, in part, on people's individual religious beliefs or orientations? We tested whether religious orientation (i.e., intrinsic, quest, religious fundamentalism) and religious involvement moderated the effects of worldview disagreement. Employing an experience sampling design, participants (N = 328) from three institutions across two countries completed responses five times per day for three days. They indicated whether or not they had experienced any religious or political worldview disagreement and completed indicators of their emotional responses, well-being, and humanity-esteem. Results indicated that across most indicators, religious orientation does not moderate the effects of worldview disagreement. Rather, regardless of religious orientation, people responded similarly. We discuss implications and suggestions for future research.","Van Tongeren, Daryl R. and Kubin, Emily and Crawford, Jarret T. and Br and t, Mark J.",0,,1835

We conducted two studies using a lexical decision task to measure death-thought accessibility. Results showed that older people primes lead to stronger facilitation of death-related compared, with negative words. Such a facilitation is not observed with young people primes (Study 1). Moreover, the automatic association between the representation of older people and death was stronger when participants and older people primes were of the same sex (Study 2). Implications of these findings with respect to ageism are discussed.","Boudjemadi, Valerian and Posner, Alex and ra and Bastart, Jennifer",0,,1836

Data were collected using the Templer Death Anxiety Scale ({TDAS}) and the Herth Hope Index ({HHI}). Results: The results of current study indicated that higher economic status, having one's main source of income from friends, increased age, increased religious belief, and increased hope were associated with lower death anxiety. Conclusion: These results highlight that improving hope, and religiosity among cardiac patients may be an effective means by which to reduce their death anxiety.","Soleimani, Mohammad Ali and Bahrami, Nasim and Zarabadi-Pour, Simin and Motalebi, Seyedeh Ameneh and Parker, Averil and Chan, Yiong Huak",0,,1837
1849,The effect of death education on fear of death amongst Italian adolescents: A nonrandomized controlled study,"This study describes the psychological effects of death education in reducing the fear of death in a large cohort of Italian adolescents. Following the constructs of ""distal defenses"" and ""mortality salience"" of Terror Management Theory, this research intervention also evaluated the proposition that spirituality and belief in an afterlife could provide an effective buffer against fear of death. Five hundred thirty-four Italian high school students participated in a school-based death education program with an experimental group and a nonrandomized control condition. Using a pre/post-course design, we assessed fear of death, alexithymia, and representations of death and spirituality for both groups. Results confirmed that the course reduced death fears and the representation of death as annihilation while also enhancing spirituality. In particular, the older participants in the death education course increased their spirituality and decreased their fear of death, whereas females reduced their conviction that death was an absolute annihilation. Finally, the structural model suggested that alexithymia mediates the relationships among fear of death and spirituality; in particular, fear of death predicted more alexithymia and more alexithymia predicted lower spirituality.","Testoni, Ines and Ronconi, Lucia and Cupit, Illene Noppe and Nodari, Elisa and Bormolini, Guidalberto and Ghinassi, Annagiulia and Messeri, Deborah and Cordioli, Claudia and Zamperini, Adriano",1,,1838
1850,Fear of death unaffected by intensity or type of afterlife belief in a Jewish population,"We investigate the relationship between religious afterlife belief and fear of death in a Jewish population. Functionalist theories of religion often assert that afterlife belief serves as a buffer for death anxiety. Accordingly, those who attest to stronger, more orthodox, beliefs in an afterlife ought to indicate lower rates of death anxiety than those who do not have strongly held afterlife beliefs. From a wide-ranging survey of attitudes and experiences with death, we show that specific beliefs, intensity of belief, and orthodoxy of held beliefs play no significant role in the self-reported level of death anxiety in a Jewish population.","Moreman, Christopher M. and Kerr, Joshua",0,,1839
1851,Desensitizing Effect of Frequently Witnessing Death in an Occupation: A Study With Turkish Health-Care Professionals,"This study aimed to investigate anxiety and fear of death created by the consciousness of death in professionals who frequently witness death and to determine variables related to the dimensions of mortality awareness. Data were gathered from 212 health-care employees, primarily those in emergency medicine and intensive care. Variance analysis was used to assess sex and experience groups using the Bonferroni post hoc test. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to determine the predictive relationships. Health-care employees' fear of death decreased with experience. No significant difference was observed between the experience groups in terms of conservatism values such as conformity, tradition, and security in the theory of basic human values. Empathy level was determined to be significantly predictive of the mortality awareness dimensions. These findings indicate a desensitization effect of witnessing the death, contrary to that predicted by the terror management theory.","Baykan, Necmi and Arslanturk, Gokhan and Durukan, Polat",1,,1840
1852,Religiosity and Death Anxiety: A Study of Muslim Dars Attendees,"Dars is usually considered a religious lecture or activity where attendees spend much time in search of Islamic information, which often keeps the attendees away from negative thinking. Religious directions, belief salience, spiritual activities and practices are significant assets for dealing with difficult situations and odds of life. Death anxiety can increase the vulnerability of development of any psychological illness. Therefore, it is vital to study whether religiosity can serve as a buffering agent to death anxiety. The objective of our study was to examine the relationship between religiosity and death anxiety among Muslim dars attendees. We also aimed to investigate the gender-based differences in religiosity and death anxiety among Muslim dars attendees. A purposive sample of 200 adults (male n = 100 and female n = 100) with the age range of 20-60 years participated in the present study. The sample was collected from informal religious gatherings (dars) from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The information was gathered through self-reporting questionnaires, death anxiety scale and index of religiosity. The questionnaires were in Urdu (native language) for ease and convenience of the respondents. Variable correlation analysis and t test was applied statistically through {SPSS} 21 version. The findings of the study indicate that there is a significant negative relationship between religiosity and death anxiety. Results also revealed that there is insignificant difference in religiosity between male and female Muslim adults. Results also specified that the level of death anxiety is higher in female than in male Muslim adults. Religiosity has a significant inverse relationship with death anxiety, and this can be helpful in reducing the anxiety-related features. Being a trans-diagnostic construct, measures can be taken to control death anxiety in order to enhance the mental well-being of masses. The present research also puts forward that the development of religious beliefs and interventions can help people to better adjust in life.","Saleem, Tamkeen and Saleem, Shemaila",0,,1841
1853,"Relationship between Attitudes to Global Rsks, Fears of Personal Death, and Proactive Coping: an Empirical Study","The article examines the fears of personal death and attitudes to global risks. It presents the results of the study conducted on the sample of Russian students (N = 521), and explores the relationship between fears of death, attitudes to global risks and proactive coping strategies. In accordance with the terror management theory (Solomon et al., 2001), it is shown that attitudes toward death make the greatest contribution to the orientation towards a return to traditional religious values and citizens' responsibility to prevent a global catastrophe. The adaptive attitudes toward death (neutral acceptance of death, fear of the loss of self-fulfillment and fear of the consequences for family) reinforce the belief in the need for cooperation to anticipate and prevent global risks, as well as the willingness to participate in disaster prevention. The maladaptive and defensive attitudes toward death (escape acceptance of death, death avoidance, fear of the loss of social identity, fear of self-annihilation) reinforce apocalypticism and fatalistic ignoring of global risks. The attitudes to global risks associated with resilience and proactive coping are highlighted: optimism about the global future, orientation towards cooperation to predict and prevent global threats, belief in the need to return to traditional religious values, as well as willingness to participate in the prevention of global risks and to protect oneself and the loved ones from them. Supporting radical solutions to prevent catastrophes, apocalypticism and fatalistic disregard for the threat are destructive from the point of view of the individual resilience. The data obtained indicate that the reminder of death in the news about global risks can shift public opinion towards conservative attitudes, reduce the readiness to search for solutions to prevent global catastrophes.","Nestik, T.

1854,The Influence of Mortality Salience on Attitudes towards Other Countries: The Role of Right-Wing Authoritarianism,"In line with the Terror Management Theory, recognition of the inevitability of death induces the paralyzing fear. To reduce this fear, people use psychological defences. They demonstrate more positive attitudes towards those who are similar to them, and more negative towards those who are different. Mortality salience influences on attitudes towards individuals and social groups. The goal of the study was to analyse the effect of mortality salience on attitudes towards ""hostile-oriented"" and ""friendly-oriented"" outgroups. To examine the effect of mortality salience, we conducted the experimental research. Students from two Russian universities (N = 80) participated in the study. Participants completed the online questionnaires to indicate the level of {RWA} and perceived threat from other countries. A week later, they arrived at the laboratory to take part in a two-factor experiment: 2 (mortality salience) x 2 (type of country). They watched videotapes with reminders of death or without it and, thereafter, demonstrated the level of sympathy, trust, and readiness to interact with inhabitants of the country. The results showed that mortality salience negatively influenced on attitudes towards ""hostile-oriented"" than towards ""friendly-oriented"" country. This difference was moderated by {RWA}. After reminders of death, people with low {RWA} demonstrated the same positions towards ""friendly"" and ""hostile-oriented"" countries. At the same time, people with high {RWA} showed more positive attitudes towards inhabitants of ""friendly-oriented"" country, whereas more negative towards people from ""hostile-oriented"" country.","Prusova, I.

1855,"Unfairness and Radicalization - Annual Review of Psychology, Vol 71","This article reviews the relationship between people's perceptions of unfairness and their tendencies to think, feel, and act in radicalizing ways. Various theories of radicalization processes are reviewed that examine key aspects of the psychology of perceived unfairness. The review shows that experienced group deprivation and perceived immorality are among the core judgments that can drive Muslim radicalization, right-wing radicalization, and left-wing radicalization. Symbols of injustice, the legitimization of revolutionary thought, and the experience of unfair treatment can also increase radicalization. The review also examines core moderators (e.g., uncertainty and insufficient self-correction) and mediators (e.g., externally oriented emotions) of the linkage between perceived unfairness and core components of radicalization (e.g., rigidity of thoughts, hot-cognitive defense of cultural worldviews, and violent rejection of democratic principles and the rule of law). The review discusses how the study of unfairness and radicalization contributes to a robust and meaningful science of psychology.","van den Bos, Kees",0,,1844
1856,Life Crafting as a Way to Find Purpose and Meaning in Life,"Having a purpose in life is one of the most fundamental human needs. However, for most people, finding their purpose in life is not obvious. Modern life has a way of distracting people from their true goals and many people find it hard to define their purpose in life. Especially at younger ages, people are searching for meaning in life, but this has been found to be unrelated to actually finding meaning. Oftentimes, people experience pressure to have a ""perfect"" life and show the world how well they are doing, instead of following up on their deep-felt values and passions. Consequently, people may need a more structured way of finding meaning, e.g., via an intervention. In this paper, we discuss evidence-based ways of finding purpose, via a process that we call ""life crafting."" This process fits within positive psychology and the salutogenesis framework - an approach focusing on factors that support human health and well-being, instead of factors that cause disease. This process ideally starts with an intervention that entails a combination of reflecting on one's values, passions and goals, best possible self, goal attainment plans, and other positive psychology intervention techniques. Important elements of such an intervention are: (1) discovering values and passion, (2) reflecting on current and desired competencies and habits, (3) reflecting on present and future social life, (4) reflecting on a possible future career, (5) writing about the ideal future, (6) writing down specific goal attainment and ""if-then"" plans, and (7) making public commitments to the goals set. Prior research has shown that personal goal setting and goal attainment plans help people gain a direction or a sense of purpose in life. Research findings from the field of positive psychology, such as salutogenesis, implementation intentions, value congruence, broaden-and-build, and goal-setting literature, can help in building a comprehensive evidence-based life-crafting intervention. This intervention can aid individuals to find a purpose in life, while at the same time ensuring that they make concrete plans to work toward this purpose. The idea is that life crafting enables individuals to take control of their life in order to optimize performance and happiness.","Schippers, Michaele C. and Ziegler, Niklas",0,,1845
1857,Minds of gods and human cognitive constraints: socio-ecological context shapes belief,"What believers say about gods' thoughts, concerns, and dispositions reflects both the minds of believers and the societies in which they live. A review of the psychology of religion literature reveals a paradox: individuals benefit from belief in divine benevolence, while groups benefit from belief in divine punishment. We propose that a resolution to this paradox lies in the combination of cognitive systems and culturally-transmitted social norms. We suggest that, as access to reflective thinking capacity is depleted, unreflective thinking driven by culturally-transmitted decision rules that are themselves shaped by local environments (e.g., norms, schemas, and scripts) play a central role in shaping beliefs about the minds of gods. We first review the psychological literature and examine how cognition and social norms might combine to favor certain patterns of beliefs around what gods know, care about, and do. We use a cultural evolutionary lens to indicate ways that various beliefs about gods' minds may confer adaptive benefits to individuals or groups across various socio-ecological contexts, focusing on three cultural strategies: honor, face, and dignity. Along the way, we draw from existing data to predict what shapes gods' minds may take and suggest ways to test predictions drawn from this review.","{McNamara}, Rita A. and Purzycki, Benjamin Grant",0,,1846
1858,Basic Tenets of Separation Theory,"This article outlines the basic tenets of separation theory, including the fantasy bond and the voice process. The fantasy bond is a unifying concept explaining how human beings seek security in fantasies of fusion in an attempt to heal the fracture related to interpersonal trauma compounded by death anxiety. Painful elements in parent-child interactions are incorporated in the form of a negative thought process or ""voice,"" creating a division in the personality between the self and the anti-self. My colleagues and I developed a methodology called ""voice therapy"" to expose and contend with people's destructive attitudes and attacks on themselves. The article also describes the evolution of a group of more than 100 associates and friends who have lived in close proximity and shared their innermost feelings in an ongoing group experience for more than 40 years. These people contributed significantly to the evolution of separation theory. Together, we developed an implicit set of values based on understanding factors that hurt people in their psychological development. The article specifies the concepts learned from observing the reference population and delineates findings from research in the neurosciences, attachment theory, and terror management theory that validate the key concepts of separation theory.","Firestone, Robert W.",0,,1847
1859,The impact of mortality anxiety on attitude toward product innovation,"Threatening environmental stimuli, such as terror attacks, armed conflicts and death imagery in advertising, have been shown to positively affect consumer attitudes and behaviors toward products. This article calls into question the generalizability of this effect to innovative products by showing that mortality anxiety, i.e., individuals' fear of their own mortality, leads to product innovation resistance. Drawing from the literature on innovation adoption and mortality anxiety, four experimental studies provide evidence that while mortality anxiety has a positive impact on the evaluation of noninnovative products, it negatively affects the evaluation of innovative products. When faced with mortality anxiety, consumers are more likely to experience state nostalgia, a temporary backward-looking mindset, in contrast with the forward-looking mode necessary to favor product innovation adoption. This process is confirmed by the positive impact of mortality anxiety on attitude toward innovative products that trigger feelings of nostalgia, or retro-innovation.","Boeuf, Benjamin",0,,1848
1860,Effects of Death Anxiety on Perceived Stress in Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis and the Role of Self-Transcendence,"Stress is a commonly reported concern of individuals with chronical diseases, including multiple sclerosis ({MS}). This study sought to investigate the relationships between self-transcendence, death anxiety, and perceived stress among individuals with {MS} from Iran. A second aim of the study was to assess the buffering effect of self-transcendence in the relationship between death anxiety and perceived stress. Two hundred and fifteen participants with {MS} from four hospitals completed measures assessing self-transcendence, death anxiety, and perceived stress. Using structural equation modeling, death anxiety was found to be positively related to perceived stress. In addition, there was a negative relationship between self-transcendence and perceived stress. Results of the study suggest that self-transcendence is a buffer in the link between death anxiety and perceived stress for individuals with {MS}. The findings demonstrate the importance of self-transcendence in decreasing the effects of death anxiety on perceived stress and have clinical implications for health professionals.","Abdollahi, Abbas and Panahipour, Hannaneh and Allen, Kelly A. and Hosseinian, Simin",0,,1849

Three hundred and fifty-eight participants, mainly undergraduates, responded to a series of vignettes that described a {MOD} (suicide, accident, or stroke) counterbalanced with three {AODs} (younger, middle-aged, and older). Overall, ratings of sympathy, empathy, and tragedy declined as {AOD} increased; however, the effect of {AOD} was not consistent across all {MODs}.

1862,"Disasters, hope and globalization: exploring self-identification with global consumer culture in Japan","Purpose An unconscious concern regarding one's inevitable death, known as mortality salience, may affect consumers' brand choices in the aftermath of disastrous events, such as earthquakes. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of self-identification with global consumer culture ({IDGCC}) in global brand purchase intention in response to disasters that heighten mortality salience. The roles of materialism, consumer ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism and hope in this this process are also explored. Design/methodology/approach An online experiment was conducted with a large sample of Japanese consumers. Japan was selected because it had recently suffered from a series of devastating earthquakes. Participants' mortality salience was primed with an earthquake scenario. All measures were adapted from prior research. The authors used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses and validate the model. Findings The results reveal that {IDGCC} is a direct predictor of global brand purchase intention when mortality salience is high. It appears that identifying with global consumer culture and buying global brands enhances self-esteem and reduces anxiety for those with high {IDGCC}. As predicted, materialism and cosmopolitanism positively influence {IDGCC}, whereas consumer ethnocentrism does not impede {IDGCC}. Hope directly and positively affects global brand purchase intention. Originality/value This study is one of the first to address traumatic events and hope, relating these concepts to {IDGCC} and global brand purchase intention in an international marketing context.","Okazaki, Shintaro and Taylor, Charles R. and Vargas, Patrick and Henseler, Jorg",0,,1851

1864,Evidence for indirect loss of significance effects on violent extremism: The potential mediating role of anomia,"Psychological research suggests that violent extremism (e.g., terrorism) stems partly from existential motives, such as individuals' need to achieve significance in life after experiencing failure, ostracism, or humiliation (Significance Quest Theory; {SQT}). Parallel investigations from sociology and criminology established similar findings by linking anomia-a syndrome including feelings of meaninglessness, powerlessness, isolation, self-estrangement, and normlessness-with violent behavior. In line with {SQT}, this contribution tested if anomia could mediate Loss of Significance effects on violent extremism. Accordingly, three studies conducted in France highlight indirect effects of exposure to discrimination on legitimation of political violence (Study 1, cross-sectional, minority population sample, N = 110), violent behavioral intentions (Study 2, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 249), and support for {ISIS} fighters (Study 3, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 221) through anomia. A subsequent study shows this indirect effect to be robust when controlled for Social Dominance Orientation and Political Extremism (Study 4, cross-sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 279). A final investigation re-analyzing data collected in Turkey highlights a reverse effect when the independent variable tapped into social inclusion (rather than exclusion; Study 5, cross-sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 321). This indirect effect was also robust to Political Extremism and Intolerance as control variables. These results support the usefulness of considering anomia as a proximal predictor of violent extremism in a {SQT} perspective.","Troian, Jais and Baidada, Ouissam and Arciszewski, Thomas and Apostolidis, Themistoklis and Celebi, Elif and Yurtbakan, Taylan",0,,1853
1865,"Emotions, deliberations, and end-of-life products","Death is inevitable; yet, not all consumers prepare for death by purchasing end-of-life ({EOL}) products. Using the theory of reasoned action ({TRA}) and the dual-process model framework, this study aims to examine the role of emotions and cognitions in influencing consumers' decisions to engage in planning for death. A mixed methodology design was used. Study 1, a qualitative study, uncovered positive and negative emotions and deliberative reasoning that comprise consumers' {EOL} purchase decision process. Study 2, a quantitative study, confirmed that emotions and deliberations independently and jointly influenced consumers' {EOL} attitude and behavior and that emotions affected deliberations for both prepaid funerals and wills. Subjective norms outperformed attitude in predicting both products' purchase behavior. These finding supported the dual-process model of behavior and the {TRA} in the {EOL} research context and contributed to the {EOL} literature by investigating the effects of emotions and deliberations concurrently; thus validating the important role of emotions in influencing {EOL} planning and purchase. In light of our findings, marketers could, after due cognizance of the morbidity and sensitivity of the topic, develop actionable promotional and segmentation strategies for {EOL} products and other emotion-laden, unsought products and service.","Sheng, Xiaojing and Simpson, Penny M. and Siguaw, Judy A.",0,,1854
1866,"The relation between mortality salience, traffic locus of control, and risky driving behavior","This study evaluated the direct relationships between mortality salience ({MS}), traffic locus of control (T-{LOC}), and risky driving behavior. The sample included 170 drivers. They completed scales measuring T-{LOC}, then they were randomly divided into one of the three condition groups: {MS} condition, traffic accidents {MS} condition, and the control condition. At the end, the participants completed a scale for measuring risky driving behavior. The results showed that {MS} interacts with the relevance of driving for self-esteem and with external T-{LOC} in determining risky driving. The implications of these results for safety and future research are discussed.","Mairean, Cornelia and Havarneanu, Corneliu-Eugen",1,,1855
1867,Mindfulness of Death as a Tool for Mortality Salience Induction with Reference to Terror Management Theory,"In this article, I argue that mindfulness of death (mara?asati) can be a tool to induce mortality salience and can have a positive psychological impact. The mindfulness of death is described in detail in the early Buddhist texts A?guttara Nikaya and Visuddhimagga. The texts stress that death should be consciously connected with temporality and mindfulness. Here, I look at the mindfulness of death in relation to the mortality salience of terror management theory. Mortality salience is a term proposed in terror management theory that means the state of conscious activation of the thoughts of death. In addition, after conscious activation of the thought of death, I examine the psychological changes, such as the increase of pro-social attitudes which emphasizes ethics and morality, and the emphasis on the intrinsic value of life due to the operation of a cultural worldview and self-esteem. In this paper, I conclude that mindfulness of death can be an effective tool to induce mortality salience.","Moon, Hyun Gong",0,,1856
1868,Interpersonal Duty as a Tool for Managing Uncertainty: Uncertainty Threat Changes Negative Affect Reaction Toward Duty Adherence/Violation,"We investigated changes in negative affect reactions toward interpersonal duty violation/adherence under uncertainty which we refer to as uncertainty threat. One's feelings of duty and obligation toward the partner may induce him/her to act in accordance to the partner's expectations, and this functions to free the relationship of uncertainty. However, if the partner fails to conform to his/her duty, we may become uncertain about the future of the relationship, and consequently, experience negative affect, including anger, contempt, and disappointment. We hypothesized that uncertainty threat leads to such negative affective arousal. Uncertainty threat motivates individuals to reduce uncertainty, and hence make them more sensitive toward the source of uncertainty, above and beyond the specific context in which it poses a threat. A series of three experiments were conducted, in which we manipulated uncertainty threat through priming and a distractor task. Participants then read a short scenario in which duty violation or adherence were described, and rated negative affect toward it. Results generally indicated significant interaction effects across the experiments. The effects of scenario manipulation on negative affect reaction were more acute under uncertainty threat than when no threat was present. The present study indicated that duty was not only beneficial for social coordination, but also vital to mask uncertainty and insecurity regarding relationships.","Terashima, Yuto and Takai, Jiro",0,,1857
1869,"""Jesus, take the wheel': the appeal of spiritual products in satiating concerns about randomness","Why are consumers drawn to spiritual products? Leveraging theorising regarding the psychological need to perceive the world as orderly and non-random, we posit that products imbued with religious/spiritual significance help manage concerns about randomness and uncontrollability (e.g. when a product is unreliable or exposes the consumer to random uncontrollable processes). When randomness concerns were salient, religious consumers showed increased desire to attach religious significance to secular objects (e.g. having item blessed, physically attaching a religious symbol). For spiritual consumers, spiritual products (vs. non-spiritual physically equivalent products) were seen as having (i) non-material efficacy (i.e. efficacy not bound to the purely material world) and (ii) unfalsifiable efficacy (i.e. efficacy that is immune to contrary evidence). Evidence is found across a variety of religious and spiritual contexts.","Shepherd, Steven and Kay, Aaron C.",0,,1858
1870,Memento Mori: The development and validation of the Death Reflection Scale,"Despite its potential for advancing organizational behavior ({OB}) research, the topic of death awareness has been vastly understudied. Moreover, research on death awareness has predominantly focused on the anxiety-provoking aspect of death-related cognitions, thus overlooking the positive aspect of death awareness, death reflection. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of a valid research instrument to measure death reflection. To address this issue, we offer a systematic conceptualization of death reflection, develop the Death Reflection Scale, and assess its psychometric properties across four studies. Further, using a sample of 268 firefighters, we examine whether death reflection buffers the detrimental impact of mortality cues at work on employee well-being and safety performance. Results provide strong support for the psychometric properties of the Death Reflection Scale. Further, moderation analysis indicates death reflection weakens the negative effect of mortality cues on firefighters' safety performance. Overall, these findings suggest the newly developed Death Reflection Scale will prove useful in future research on death-related cognitions.","Yuan, Zhenyu and Baranik, Lisa E. and Sinclair, Robert R. and Sliter, Michael T. and R and , Kevin L. and Salyers, Michelle P.",0,,1859
1874,Atheist primes reduce religiosity and subjective wellbeing,"In recent years, atheism has grown in popularity, partly inspired by the rise to prominence of a group of public intellectuals called the ""New Atheists"" who argue against religion in public fora. What are the social consequences of this development? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to atheist arguments affects self-reported and implicit religiosity, subjective wellbeing, and self-reported tolerance of different social groups. We find a significant negative effect of emotional arguments against religion on both self-reported and implicit measures of religiosity, especially among men, but no effect of scientific appeals. Subjective wellbeing is strongly reduced after emotional atheist messages, again especially among men, suggesting that emotional atheist arguments may have a wellbeing cost. We find no effects of atheism messages on self-reported tolerance. Together, these results suggest that emotional atheist arguments reduce religiosity and subjective wellbeing, especially among men.","Haushofer, Johannes and Reisinger, James",0,,1860
1875,A Functional Model of Kitsch and Art: Linking Aesthetic Appreciation to the Dynamics of Social Motivation,"With the advent of modernity, change and novelty have become the core values of artistic production. At the same time the derogatory term ""kitsch"" was coined to contrast truly ground-breaking artistic achievements. In this article, we argue that kitsch and avant-garde art ideally represent two complementary types of aesthetic experience: a fluent one that allows for immediate emotional gratification (kitsch) and a disfluent one that requires cognitive elaboration (art). We make a case that preferences for the one or the other are dynamically related to a set of conflicting needs which constitute the basic dilemma of human attachment behavior: needs for safety and intimacy versus needs for arousal and autonomy. Based on the Zurich Model of Social Motivation we hypothesize that social distance regulation and aesthetic liking are synchronized via notions of self-efficacy and autonomy: Whenever we feel safe and self-sufficient, an appetence for arousal (curiosity) is likely to arise that increases our interest in unfamiliar conspecifics as well as in innovative, cognitively challenging aesthetic stimuli (art). By contrast, when we feel vulnerable and dependent, a longing for safety and relatedness (nostalgia) attracts us not only to familiar and trustworthy individuals but also to conventional aesthetic stimuli charged with positive emotions (kitsch). This theoretical framework offers an integrative perspective on dynamics of aesthetic liking in that it unites a wide variety of phenomena from anthropology, developmental, and cognitive psychology with concepts and findings from art history, sociology of art, and empirical aesthetics.","Ortlieb, Stefan A. and Carbon, Claus-Christian",0,,1861

Objective: This article aims to distinguish adaptive, maladaptive and defensive attitudes toward death from the characteristics of individual time orientations, balanced time perspective and hardiness. Materials: the sample comprises 967 students from various cities of Russia (457 males, 503 females, 7 undefined, age 17-37, M=20, {SD}=1.97). Methods: Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, Hardiness Survey, short versions of Death Attitudes Profile Revised and Fear of Personal Death Scale. Results: the {DBTP} index (deviation from balanced time perspective) and general index of Hardiness contribute significantly into all parameters of death attitudes and fears, and determined from 1.2\% of dispersion (for the ""fear of consequences for personality"") to 15.8\% (for the ""escape acceptance of death""). More detailed regression analysis, which considered specific time perspectives and indices of hardiness allowed to determine the input of these values into the studied constructs more precisely: from 3.6\% of dispersion (for ""neutral acceptance of death"") 18.6\% (for ""escape acceptance of death""). Qualitative analysis of the regression models allowed to distinguish adaptive, maladaptive and defensive attitudes toward death in young adults. The adaptive ones were ""fear of consequences for personality"", ""fear of consequences for family and friends"", ""neutral acceptance of death"": the maladaptive were ""escape acceptance of death"", ""fear of being forgotten""; ""fear of death"", ""death avoidance"" and ""approach acceptance of death"", as well as ""fear of transpersonal consequences"", ""fear of consequences for body"" were categorized as defensive attitudes. Conclusions: Adaptive, maladaptive and defensive ways to think of own death were found from the perspective of self-continuity. Such systematization of death attitudes and fears serves to help the practitioners in the domain of suicidology to find the vector of psychological correction: which fears of the patients are worth normalizing, and for which special attention is needed in order to alleviate their magnitude through changes in relation to patients' own personal history.","Chistopolskaya, K.

1877,The Dynamics of Public Opinion Following Terror Attacks: Evidence for a Decrease in Equalitarian Values From Internet Search Volume Indices,"The tendency of terror attacks to generate increased right-wing attitudes is a direct prediction from the motivated cognition approach to political ideology (lost, 2017). However, due to methodological and theoretical problems, evidence for this 'right-shift' hypothesis is currently mixed. To address these issues, we introduce for the first-time search volume indices ({SVI}) analysis to the study of public opinion dynamics by assessing the effects of exposure to the 2015 Paris terror attacks, with a focus on equalitarian values related searches in the French cyberspace. Consistent with the 'right-shift' hypothesis, we demonstrate that online collective threat salience ({SVI} for the word 'terror attack') predicts significant decreases in equalitarian values {SW} (e.g. 'equality') 6 weeks later, but not in non-equalitarian values {SVI} (e.g. 'liberty'). Mixed-model analyses of {SVI} for the period 2012-2017 confirmed these results by showing both decrease in equalitarian values {SW} and no change in non-equalitarian values {SW} after 2015. These findings corroborate the 'right-shift' hypothesis at the societal level using ecological-behavioural measures of public opinion and demonstrate the value of {SVI} analysis for theory-testing in political psychology.","Troian, Jais and Arciszewski, Thomas and Apostolidis, Themistoklis",0,,1863
1878,Mortality Salience Effects on Evaluations of Foreign Brands: Evidence from India,"This article uses the lens of terror management theory to investigate mortality salience effects on the evaluation of a brand from a developed country among consumers in a developing country. A survey was conducted among Indian consumers in which mortality was made salient for certain participants. Mortality salience showed positive correlation with favorable evaluations of the brand from the developed country indicating the effect of mortality salience on country-of-origin evaluations. Results suggest positive evaluations of brands from developed countries may augment self-esteem of consumers. This study highlights that, in emerging markets, consumers aware of mortality salience may not always evaluate a foreign brand negatively. The findings provide managers guidance for positioning foreign brands, emphasizing the prestige associated with these brands.","Banerjee, Shubhomoy and Ghosh, Abhijit and Kagan, Albert and Chatterjee, Soumi",0,,1864

Results from multivariate regression models indicate: (1) Combat casualty exposure was positively associated with sleep disturbance; (2) religious salience both offset and moderated (i.e., buffered) the above association; and (3) religious attendance offset but did not moderate the above association.

1880,Linked oppression: Connecting animal and gender attitudes,"Ecofeminists and animal rights advocates have posited a connection between the oppression of women and the oppression of animals. Although male/female comparisons regarding attitudes toward animals have frequently been considered, only limited research has focused on gender roles and animal attitudes. We therefore examined the relation between gender roles and animal attitudes with undergraduate students (260 males, 484 females) at a public university in Texas. Participants responded to an online Qualtrics survey that assessed their attitudes toward animals, gender norms, and several forms of sexism. The survey also presented participants with questions about their justifications for meat consumption. As hypothesized, pro meat-eating justifications were positively related to sexist attitudes as well as traditional gender roles and negatively related to gender role transcendent attitudes. On the other hand, pro-animal attitudes were positively correlated with gender role transcendent attitudes and negatively correlated with benevolent/hostile sexism and traditional gender attitudes. Our results empirically supported ""the linked oppression thesis,"" that gender and animal attitudes are connected.","Allcorn, Ashley and Ogletree, Shirley M.",0,,1866
1881,Shared reality in interpersonal relationships,"Close relationships afford us opportunities to create and maintain meaning systems as shared perceptions of ourselves and the world. Establishing a sense of mutual understanding allows for creating and maintaining lasting social bonds, and as such, is important in human relations. In a related vein, it has long been known that knowledge of significant others in one's life is stored in memory and evoked with new persons - in the social-cognitive process of 'transference' - imbuing new encounters with significance and leading to predictable cognitive, evaluative, motivational, and behavioral consequences, as well as shifts in the self and self-regulation, depending on the particular significant other evoked. In these pages, we briefly review the literature on meaning as interpersonally defined and then selectively review research on transference in interpersonal perception. Based on this, we then highlight a recent series of studies focused on shared meaning systems in transference. The highlighted studies show that values and beliefs that develop in close relationships (as shared reality) are linked in memory to significant-other knowledge, and thus, are indirectly activated (made accessible) when cues in a new person implicitly activate that significant-other knowledge (in transference), with these shared beliefs then actively pursued with the new person and even protected against threat. This also confers a sense of mutual understanding, and all told, serves both relational and epistemic functions. In concluding, we consider as well the relevance of co-construction of shared reality n such processes.","Andersen, Susan M. and Przybylinski, Elizabeth",0,,1867
1882,"Dead-Survivors, the Living Dead, and Concepts of Death","The author introduces and critically analyzes two recent, curious findings and their accompanying explanations regarding how the folk intuits the capabilities of the dead and those in a persistent vegetative state ({PVS}). The dead are intuited to survive death, whereas {PVS} patients are intuited as more dead than the dead. Current explanations of these curious findings rely on how the folk is said to conceive of death and the dead: either as the annihilation of the person (via the secular conception of death), or that person's continuation as a disembodied being (via folk dualism). The author argues that these two conceptions are incompatible and inconsistent with each other and the evidence. Contrariwise, the author argues that the folk intuition about dead-survivors and the living dead are more easily explained by appealing to cross-culturally established concepts: the folk biological concept of death the existential (metaphorical) concept of death, and the concept of social death.","Hodge, K.

1883,Understanding green purchase behavior through death anxiety and individual social responsibility: Mastery as a moderator,"This research proposes a framework to explore green consumption behavior from the perspective of the anxiety of death and individual social responsibility. Research data are collected from a sample of 280 consumers in Taipei, Taiwan. The findings reveal that consumers' anxiety of death affects consumers' green purchase attitude and then ultimately green purchase intention through the mediating variables of environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior. On a similar line, individual social responsibility is found to act as a precursor in increasing consumer's concern for the environment and, eventually, green purchase attitude and intention. Mastery is found to invigorate the effect of death anxiety on green concern and pro-environmental behavior, while it enervates the relationship between individual social responsibility and environmental concern.","Rahimah, Anni and Khalil, Shadab and Cheng, Julian Ming-Sung and Tran, Mai Dong and Panwar, Vinod",0,,1869
1884,Putting Your Money Where Your Mouth Is: An Experimental Test of Pro-Environmental Spillover From Reducing Meat Consumption to Monetary Donations,"Psychological studies testing behavioral spilloverthe notion that behavior change resulting from an intervention affects subsequent similar behaviorshas resulted in conflicting findings in the environmental domain. This study sought to further demarcate the spillover process by asking participants to engage in a difficult first pro-environmental behavior, reducing red meat consumption, for either health or environmental reasons. Evidence of spillover was tested via a subsequent monetary donation to an environmental organization. While there was no evidence of spillover for those in the green behavior condition, those in the health behavior condition were less likely to donate relative to controls. There was evidence that pro-environmental behavior led to an increase in environmental concern. In turn, environmental concern was associated with an increased likelihood of donating. Environmental concern may, thus, be one route to positive spillover in some subsets of the population.","Carrico, Am and a R. and Raimi, Kaitlin T. and Truelove, Heather Barnes and Eby, Brianne",0,,1870
1885,Keep calm and eat satay: Indonesia's consumption-themed signals of defiance against terrorism,"Many have noted the unique response of the Indonesian society to the bombing attacks that happened in Jakarta in January 2016. Whereas other societies have shown a variety of responses ranging from displaying regional solidarity to counter-aggression, Indonesians took to social media with irreverent, consumption-themed messages against the perceived terrorist agenda. We used symbolic interactionism as a lens to frame an analysis of Indonesian social media and news articles following the attacks to investigate the underlying factors influencing the gestation of this unique response. We found the interplay of various Indonesian cultural characteristics were influential in the collective negotiation of identity against the worldview threats of terrorism. This research is thought to be the first to investigate a phenomenon where the idea of consumption itself is used as an instrument of social resilience.

1886,Both the Survival Scenario and the Death Scenario Improve Memory Recall Regardless of the Processing/Priming Paradigm,"Memory researchers have suggested human's memory system can help us remember adaptive information conducive to survival and avoiding death. However, in previous studies, the ""survival-"" orienting task and the ""death-"" orienting task were adopted in different paradigms. Specifically, the survival-related task was adopted in a processing paradigm, in which participants were instructed to process words in terms of its relevance of survival value, while the death-related task was adopted in a priming paradigm, in which participants were first placed in a death-salient state, and then rated the pleasantness of each word without encoding its death value. The current study aimed to explore whether death scenarios improve recall as much as survival scenarios regardless of the processing/priming paradigm. In Experiment 1, we compared a survival scenario, a death scenario and a control scenario in both processing and priming paradigms. Our results showed that: (a) both survival-related thoughts and death-related thoughts could improve memory recall, both in processing and in priming paradigms; and (b) participants' proportion of correct recall did not show difference between the survival and the death conditions. In Experiment 2, we used a more detailed control scenario and showed that both the death scenario and the survival scenario yielded higher recall than the control scenario in the priming paradigm. Together, our results suggest that both survival and death scenarios have a similar effect on memory recall regardless of the processing/priming paradigms.","Zhao, Xiaolin and Li, Hao and Zhang, Xinxin and Yang, Juan",0,,1872
1887,Monetary Intelligence and Behavioral Economics Across 32 Cultures: Good Apples Enjoy Good Quality of Life in Good Barrels,"Monetary Intelligence theory asserts that individuals apply their money attitude to frame critical concerns in the context and strategically select certain options to achieve financial goals and ultimate happiness. This study explores the bright side of Monetary Intelligence and behavioral economics, frames money attitude in the context of pay and life satisfaction, and controls money at the macro-level ({GDP} per capita) and micro-level (Z income). We theorize: Managers with low love of money motive but high stewardship behavior will have high subjective well-being: pay satisfaction and quality of life. Data collected from 6586 managers in 32 cultures across six continents support our theory. Interestingly, {GDP} per capita is related to life satisfaction, but not to pay satisfaction. Individual income is related to both life and pay satisfaction. Neither {GDP} nor income is related to Happiness (money makes people happy). Our theoretical model across three {GDP} groups offers new discoveries: In high {GDP} (rich) entities, ""high income"" not only reduces aspirations-""Rich, Motivator, and Power,"" but also promotes stewardship behavior-""Budget, Give/Donate, and Contribute"" and appreciation of ""Achievement."" After controlling income, we demonstrate the bright side of Monetary Intelligence: Low love of money motive but high stewardship behavior define Monetary Intelligence. ""Good apples enjoy good quality of life in good barrels."" This notion adds another explanation to managers' low magnitude of dishonesty in entities with high Corruption Perceptions Index ({CPI}) (risk aversion for gains of high probability) . In low {GDP} (poor) entities, high income is related to poor Budgeting skills and escalated Happiness. These managers experience equal satisfaction with pay and life. We add a new vocabulary to the conversation of monetary intelligence, income, {GDP}, happiness, subjective well-being, good and bad apples and barrels, corruption, and behavioral ethics.","Tang, Thomas Li-Ping and Sutarso, Toto and Ansari, Mahfooz A. and Lim, Vivien Kim Geok and Teo, Thompson Sian Hin and Arias-Galicia, Fern and o and Garber, Ilya E. and Chiu, R and y Ki-Kwan and Charles-Pauvers, Brigitte and Luna-Arocas, Roberto and Vlerick, Peter and Ak and e, Adebowale and Allen, Michael W. and Al-Zubaidi, Abdulgawi Salim and Borg, Mark G. and Canova, Luigina and Cheng, Bor-Shiuan and Correia, Rosario and Du, Linzhi and Garcia de la Torre, Consuelo and Ibrahim, Abdul Hamid Safwat and Jen, Chin-Kang and Kazem, Ali Mahdi and Kim, Kilsun and Liang, Jian and Malovics, Eva and Manganelli, Anna Maria and Moreira, Alice S. and Mpoyi, Richard T. and Nnedum, Anthony Ugochukwu Obiajulu and Osagie, Johnsto E. and Osman-Gani, {AAhad} M. and Ozbek, Mehmet Ferhat and Costa Pereira, Francisco Jose and Pholsward, Ruja and Pitariu, Horia D. and Polic, Marko and Sardzoska, Elisaveta Gjorgji and Skobic, Petar and Stembridge, Allen F. and Tang, Theresa Li-Na and Urbain, Caroline and Trontelj, Martina and Chen, Jingqiu and Tang, Ningyu",0,,1873

Based on terror management theory ({TMT}), we show that this register can be counterproductive in generating consumer choices that run counter to pro-environmental logics. In particular, we report the results of an experiment (N=132) testing the influence of the type of communication (anxiogenic vs informative) on consumer choices (pro-materialistic vs pro-environmental). The results reveal that people's consumption choices depend on their cultural worldviews (i.e. materialistic vs environmentalist) and the type of communication used. The effectiveness of communication strategies on climate change is then discussed in terms of people's cultural worldview.","Akil, Hussein and Robert-Demontrond, Philippe and Bouille, Julien",1,,1874

Results across seven studies demonstrate that when the concept of God is salient, consumer compliance and persuasion in response to fear appeals is dampened. Importantly, the results suggest that one reason for this persuasion-dampening effect of God salience is the fact that consumers associate the concept of God with the idea of unlimited support. Consistent with this, the results reveal that when God is not associated with the idea of support, the dampening effect of God salience on fear appeal compliance is eliminated.","Wu, Eugenia C. and Cutright, Keisha M.",0,,1875
1890,Dining alone? Solo consumers' self-esteem and incidental similarity,"Purpose Though social trends are driving consumers toward solo consumption of various services, many are reluctant to do so. There is little guidance for service providers as to how to effectively induce solo consumption. This study aims to examine the joint effect of self-esteem and an incidental similarity cue (e.g. a person's initials) on anticipated satisfaction with with a solo consumption experience to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach This study used a two-factor (incidental similarity cue and self-esteem) quasi-experimental design to test the hypotheses. The respondents read a scenario depicting a solo service consumption experience and completed scales that measured perceived fit with the service context and anticipated satisfaction with the experience. Findings Results indicate that, in the absence of an incidental similarity cue, self-esteem has a positive effect on solo consumers' perceived fit. In the presence of such a cue, however, self-esteem has a minimal impact on perceived fit. Furthermore, perceived fit mediates the effect of self-esteem on anticipated satisfaction when the cue is absent. Originality/value The authors' findings suggest that promoting incidental similarities with consumers may not be an efficient strategy to attract solo consumers. Conversely, service providers wishing to induce solo consumption may benefit from situationally increasing self-esteem among potential solo consumers. The current research advances the authors' understanding of the effect of an incidental similarity cue and self-esteem in the context of a growing social trend of solo consumption.","Shin, Joongwon and Hwang, Yoohee and Mattila, Anna S.",0,,1876
1892,"{EXAMINING} {THE} {RELATIONSHIP} {BETWEEN} {DEATH} {ANXIETY} {AND} {SELF}-{ESTEEM}, {RELIGIOUS} {WORLDVIEWS}, {PURPOSE} {IN} {LIFE}","Death is an inevitable fact for all living beings. Differently from other living beings, human beings are aware of the reality of death. The subject of this study is examining the relationships between death anxiety and self-esteem, religious worldviews, purpose in life of college students. In this respect, it is assumed that death anxiety has negative relationships with self-esteem, religious worldviews and purpose in life. Living with the reality and inevitability of death is a source of anxiety for human beings (Solomon, et al., 1991). This is explained by Terror Management Theory of Social Psychology. According to this theory, people focus on increasing their self-esteem levels to reduce this anxiety since self-esteem acts as a buffer against possible anxiety caused by the awareness of human mortality (Rosenblatt, et al., 1989). Self -esteem is the attitude of an individual towards him- / herself that also gives information about the individual (Mruk, 2006). Religious worldviews is the belief of an individual in spirituality, supernatural, purpose in life, the existence of another life and the creator (Henze, 2006). Death takes a large part in Islamic religion. It is interpreted not as an annihilation but a transformation (Yildiz, 2014). Religion includes economic, political, social and cultural areas; ethical rules, values and practices that affects all aspects of life (Marshall \& van Saanen, 2007). Religion is a worldview and creates a value system (Mehmedoglu, 2013). The purpose in life is described as a feeling that both the present and the past have a meaning (Ryff, 1989). If an individual has no meaning in life and no specific purpose in life, this creates anxiety (Yalom, 1999). The most important goal of an individual is the search for meaning in life which is also the fundamental motivational sources of an individual (Frankl, 2000). The suppression or inhibition of the search for meaning in life creates anxiety (Burrow, et al., 2014). In total of 711 (64.1 \% women and 35.9 \% men) college students from different departments of a state university in Middle Anatolian region voluntarily participated in this study. Data were collected utilizing Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), Religious Worldviews Scale (Goplen \& Plant, 2015), Purpose of Life Scale (Crumbaugh \& Maholick, 1964), Death Anxiety Scale (Thorson \& Powell, 1992) and personal information form which is developed by the authors of this study. Self -esteem scale was developed by Rosenberg (1965) and adapted to Turkish language by Cuhadaroglu (1986). This scale consists of 10 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,84 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,80. The religious worldviews scale was developed by Goplen \& Plant (2015) and adapted to Turkish language by Kusat \& Bulut (2016). This scale consists of 19 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,88 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,86. The purpose of life scale was developed by Crumbaugh \& Maholick (1964, 1969) and adapted to Turkish language by Kirac (2015). This scale consists of 16 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,90 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,85. The death anxiety scale was developed by Thorson \& Powell (1992) and adapted to Turkish language by Karaca \& Yildiz (2001). This scale consists of 25 items. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient is 0,86 and split -half reliability coefficient is 0,83. In analyzing the data, quantitative analyses techniques were used. Means and standard deviations of descriptive statistical techniques were applied. In comparing two independent groups: t-test for independent groups, in comparing more than two groups: variance analysis, in examining the relationships between the variables: correlation analysis and in examining the explained variance in death anxiety: hierarchical regression analysis from inferential statistical techniques were used. Data were analyzed by {SPSS} 23 statistical package program. According to the findings of this study, in mean scores self-esteem, religious worldviews and purpose in life variables have 'high' and death anxiety has 'medium' score. Independent groups t - test results showed that women's self-esteem, religious worldviews, purpose in life and death anxiety scores are significantly higher than men's scores. {ANOVA} results showed that there are statistically significant differences in religious worldviews and purpose in life scores between faculties and differences in religious worldviews scores between classes. There are no statistically significant relationships between death anxiety and self-esteem, religious worldviews, purpose in life. Lastly, according to the hierarchical regression analysis results, gender explains the variance significantly in death anxiety. The findings were discussed on the basis of relevant literature and some suggestions were made","Bulut, Meryem Berrin and Kusat, Ali",0,,1877
1893,Reading Islamophobia in Hegemonic Neoliberalism Through a Discourse Analysis of Donald Trump's Narratives,"This paper uses the Wittgensteinian method of discourse analysis to analyze the narratives of Islamophobia in Donald Trump's speeches and interviews. Theoretically, the analysis is informed by hegemonic neoliberal ideology. It argues that to sustain itself, hegemonic neoliberalism must contrast itself against other belief systems that it unilaterally denounces as inferior. After having done so, hegemonic neoliberalism then seeks to neoliberalize those belief systems. In this vein, this paper contends that hegemonic neoliberalism has an Islamophobic face because it otherizes Islam and Muslims in order to justify its neoliberalization of Islam and Muslims. Thus, this paper defines neoliberal Islamophobia as the conceptualization of Islam and Muslims as antithetical to neoliberal values. In all, Trump's speeches and interviews contain five Islamophobic narratives: (1) radical Islam is the sole cause of terrorism; (2) radical Islamic terrorism is a global existential threat; (3) Muslim refugees and immigrants are a threat to American security; (4) the proposal to suspend entry of Muslim refugees and immigrants to the {US}; and (5) the faux humanitarian policy of establishing safe zones for Muslim refugees in Syria. The paper concludes with policy implications.","Waikar, Prashant",0,,1878
1894,"Death, quest, and self-esteem: re-examining the role of self-esteem and religion following mortality salience","Terror management theory suggests that when mortality concerns are salient, religion can serve as a defence in order to boost self-esteem and shield against the potential for anxiety. The current study examined whether individual differences in religious orientation (i.e., quest) interacted with reminders of death to influence well-being. To the extent that religiosity buffers against mortality awareness on defensiveness, the present results demonstrated that individuals high in quest orientation, in comparison to low-quest-orientated individuals, reported lower well-being (i.e.,self-esteem) following reminders of death. These results add to the existing body of literature suggesting that thoughts of death can serve to decrease well-being, but that this effect is influenced by individual differences, namely trait quest religiosity.","Arrowood, Robert B. and Coleman, Thomas J. and Swanson, Sally B. and Hood, Ralph W. and Cox, Cathy R.",1,,1879
1895,Modelling terror management theory: computer simulations of the impact of mortality salience on religiosity,"This article outlines the development - and reports on the experimental findings - of two computational models designed to simulate the dynamic systems and behavioural patterns identified and clarified by research on terror management theory. The causal architectures of these models are informed by empirical research on the effects of mortality salience on ""religiosity"" (and vice versa). They are also informed by research on the way in which perception of personal and environmental hazards activate evolved cognitive and coalitional precautionary systems that can intensify anxiety-alleviating behaviours such as imaginative engagement with supernatural agents postulated within a religious coalition. The capacity of the models to produce emergent patterns and behaviours that are similar to the results of other empirical studies supports the plausibility of their causal architectures. After tracing some of the literature that supports the causal dynamics of our models, we present the two models, describe the experiments, and report the results. We conclude by discussing the importance of the findings, the limitations of the models, and directions for future research.","Shults, F. {LeRon} and Lane, Justin E. and Wildman, Wesley J. and Diallo, Saikou and Lynch, Christopher J. and Gore, Ross",0,,1880
1896,Concern and death anxiety during an ongoing terror wave: The moderating role of direct vs. indirect exposure,"The current study examined whether emotional concern over one's security situation is connected with death anxiety during an ongoing terror wave, and whether type of exposure (media exposure vs. contact with witnesses) moderates this connection. A total of 345 individuals, aged 18-70, were sampled during an ongoing wave of terror in Israel and filled out scales measuring death anxiety, concern over security situation, and type of exposure. Results indicated that increased concern was connected with enhanced death anxiety. Moreover, this connection was more pronounced among individuals exposed to the events through the media, in comparison with individuals who had first-hand contact with witnesses.","Mahat-Shamir, Michal and Hamama-Raz, Yaira and Ben-Ezra, Menachem and Pitcho-Prelorentzos, Shani and Zaken, Adi and David, Udi Y. and Bergman, Yoav S.",1,,1881
1897,Openness to experience predicts intrinsic value shifts after deliberating one's own death,"Individual differences that might moderate processes of value shifting during and after deliberating one's own death remain largely unexplored. Two studies measured participants' openness and relative intrinsic-to-extrinsic value orientation ({RIEVO}) before randomly assigning them to conditions in which they wrote about their own death or dental pain for 6 days, after which {RIEVO} was assessed again up to 12 days later. When participants confronted thoughts about their own death over a sustained period, high openness to experience helped them shift toward intrinsic values. Implications for understanding openness' role in value reorientation from existential deliberation processes are discussed.","Prentice, Mike and Kasser, Tim and Sheldon, Kennon M.",1,,1882
1899,{WHEN} {DOES} {CORPORATE} {SOCIAL} {RESPONSIBILITY} {REDUCE} {EMPLOYEE} {TURNOVER}? {EVIDENCE} {FROM} {ATTORNEYS} {BEFORE} {AND} {AFTER} 9/11,"This study places important boundary conditions on the generally accepted notion that {CSR} will reduce turnover. Our primary argument is that {CSR} will be most effective at reducing turnover that is motivated by a preference for more meaningfulness at work. We find empirical support for this idea using microdata on attorneys employed by large law firms. We find that firms with higher levels of {CSR} have moderately lower rates of turnover to startup law firms and turnover through occupation changes, moves which are more likely to be motivated by a preference for meaningfulness than moves to nonstartup law firms. Strikingly, the retention benefits of {CSR} are much stronger after attorneys experience mortality-related shocks that likely cause them to reevaluate their jobs (i.e., for New York City-born attorneys following the 9/11 terror attacks). To our surprise, we also find that firms with higher levels of {CSR} experience higher turnover rates to nonstartup law firms. In addition to our arguments about the importance of meaningfulness, the study provides two important extensions to work examining {CSR} and turnover: (1) it may be useful to view the {CSR}-turnover relationship through a risk-management lens, and (2) investments in {CSR} may increase employee departures from organizations under certain conditions.","Carnahan, Seth and Kryscynski, David and Olson, Daniel",0,,1883
1900,Uncertainty Increases the Reliance on Affect in Decisions,"How do psychological states of uncertainty influence the way people make decisions? We propose that such states increase the reliance on affective inputs in judgments and decisions. In accord with this proposition, results from six studies show that the priming of uncertainty (vs. certainty) consistently increases the effects of a variety of affective inputs on consumers' judgments and decisions. Primed uncertainty is shown to amplify the effects of the pleasantness of a musical soundtrack (study 1), the attractiveness of a picture (study 2), the appeal of affective attributes (studies 3 and 4), incidental mood states (study 6), and even incidental states of disgust (study 5). Moreover, both negative and positive uncertainty increase the influence of affect in decisions (study 4). The results additionally show that the increased reliance on affective inputs under uncertainty does not necessarily come at the expense of a reliance on descriptive attribute information (studies 2 and 5), and that the increased reliance on affect under uncertainty is distinct from a general reliance on heuristic or peripheral cues (study 6). The phenomenon may be due to uncertainty threatening the self, thereby encouraging a reliance on inputs that are closer to the self and have high subjective validity.","Faraji-Rad, Ali and Pham, Michel Tuan",0,,1884
1901,"Some guidelines for surfing the edge of chaos, while riding dangerously close to the black hole of trauma","The political scene in the {USA} has changed dramatically with the election of Donald Trump, and antidemocratic forces appear to be gaining momentum in other countries as well. Using a post-traumatic lens to view these political forces, the author summarizes social psychology research on authoritarianism, terror management theory, and obedience studies to illustrate some of the challenges that lie ahead for citizens who want to restore Enlightenment values to their rightful position and, in doing so, defeat the antidemocratic, authoritarian and antiscientific forces that are on the rise. Then, drawing upon the growing knowledge base about the power of organizational culture and the change process, the author emphasizes the importance for any group aiming at progressive ideals to embrace a shared knowledge base, a set of shared values, a shared language and an array of shared tools for practical application in a group.","Bloom, S and ra L.",0,,1885
1902,From Threat to Relief: Expressing Prejudice toward Atheists as a Self-Regulatory Strategy Protecting the Religious Orthodox from Threat,"We claim that religious orthodoxy is related to prejudice toward groups that violate important values, i.e., atheists. Moreover, we suggest that expressing prejudice may efficiently reduce the threat posed by this particular group among people who hold high levels, but not low levels, of orthodox belief. We tested these assumptions in an experimental study in which, after being exposed to atheistic worldviews (value-threat manipulation), high and low orthodox participants were allowed (experimental condition) or not (control condition) to express prejudice toward atheists. Threat was operationalized by cardiovascular reactivity, i.e., heart rate ({HR}); the higher the {HR} index, the higher the threat. The results found that people who hold high (vs. low) levels of orthodox belief responded with increased {HR} after the threat manipulation. However, we observed decreased {HR} after the expression of prejudice toward atheists among highly orthodox participants compared to the control condition. We did not find this effect among people holding low levels of orthodox belief. Thus, we conclude that expressing prejudice toward this particular group may be an efficient strategy to cope with the threat posed by this group for highly orthodox people. The results are discussed in light of previous findings on religious beliefs and the self-regulatory function of prejudice.","Kossowska, Malgorzata and Szwed, Paulina and Czernatowicz-Kukuczka, Aneta and Sekerdej, Maciek and Wyczesany, Miroslaw",0,,1886
1903,"Does the pursuit of meaning explain the initiation, escalation, and disengagement of violent extremists?","Researchers have uncovered an array of conditions, characteristics, and cognitions that can ignite, escalate, or reverse the radicalization of individuals. Because a multitude of events and circumstances determine the likelihood that people gravitate to violent extremism, practitioners cannot readily ascertain which individuals are most susceptible to this pathway. This paper explicates and explores a theory, derived from the meaning maintenance model and the socio-ernotional selectivity theory, that integrates previous insights into a cohesive framework. According to this theory, to foster meaning in life, individuals are motivated to cultivate four conditions: a just and supportive environment, unambiguous standards, enduring values, and extensive capabilities. Violent extremism offers some individuals the opportunity to cultivate these conditions temporarily, galvanizing radicalization. Yet this pursuit can also impede these conditions, provoking the motivation to disengage from this endeavor. We presented a case study that illustrates this premise. In short, the motivations that can attract people to violent extremism can also promote disengagement as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Ali, Rosleenda B.

1904,Death anxiety and visual oculomotor processing of arousing stimuli in a free view setting,"The main goal of this study was to determine how death anxiety ({DA}) affects visual processing when confronted with arousing stimuli. A total of 26 males and females were primed with either {DA} or a neutral primer and were given a free view/free choice task where eye movement was measured using an eye tracker. The goal was to identify measurable/observable indicators of whether the subjects were under the influence of {DA} during the free view. We conducted an eye tracking study because this is an area where we believe it is possible to find observable indicators. Ultimately, we observed some changes in the visual behavior, such as a prolonged average latency, altered sensitivity to the repetition of stimuli, longer fixations, less time in saccadic activity, and fewer classifications related to focal and ambient processing, which appear to occur under the influence of {DA} when the subjects are confronted with arousing stimuli.","Wendelberg, Linda and Volden, Frode and Yildirim-Yayilgan, Sule",0,,1888
1905,Many faces of dogmatism: Prejudice as a way of protecting certainty against value violators among dogmatic believers and atheists,"In this article, we suggest that dogmatic beliefs, manifested as strong beliefs that there is no God (i. e., dogmatic atheism) as well as strong beliefs in God (i. e., religious orthodoxy), can serve as a cognitive response to uncertainty. Moreover, we claim that people who dogmatically do not believe in religion and those who dogmatically believe in religion are equally prone to intolerance and prejudice towards groups that violate their important values. That is because prejudice towards these groups may be an efficient strategy to protect the certainty that strong beliefs provide. We tested these assumptions in two studies. In Study 1 and Study 2, we demonstrated that dogmatic beliefs mediate the relationship between intolerance to uncertainty and both, religious orthodoxy and dogmatic atheism. In addition, in Study 2 we showed that both the religiously orthodox and dogmatic atheists become prejudiced towards groups that violate their values and that these effects are especially strong under experimentally induced uncertainty. In this study, we focused on atheists and homosexuals as groups that pose a threat to Christian's religious worldviews, and Catholics and pro-life supporters as groups that pose a threat to the values of atheists. The results are discussed in relation to past research on dogmatism and religion, as well as with reference to what this means for the study of prejudice.","Kossowska, Malgorzata and Czernatowicz-Kukuczka, Aneta and Sekerdej, Maciej",0,,1889
1906,A {COMMENTARY}: {FEARLESSNESS} {ABOUT} {DEATH} - A {STATIC} {OR} A {DYNAMIC} {QUALITY}?,"Introduction: The work by T. Teismann et al. on the fearlessness about death raises a question: is it a static and stable quality? Is it possible that it changes during life in one way or another because of some events? Objectives: The objective of this article is to explore these problems. Methods: The article includes the results of three studies on attitudes and fears of death. Two studies explored these questions in students (2012-2015, N=944, 451 males, 493 females, national sample, and 2016, N=221, 50 males, 171 females, M=19,7, {SD}=1,19, Cheboksary), and one study addressed these issues in people in acute postsuicide, administered to the Sklifosovsky Emergency Research Institute, male and female departments of toxicology (N=185, 65 males, 120 females of 18-25 years of age, M=21,3, {SD}=2,42) in comparison with the sample of students from the State University of Management (N=156, 39 males, 117 females, M=19,9, {SD}=2,85). In the study of suicidals we used following instruments: Death Attitude Profile-Revised, Fear of Personal Death Scale, Experience in Close Relationships-Revised, Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, Hardiness Survey, Beck Depression Inventory. We present the results from Death Attitude Profile Revised, Fear of Death scale from the national study. From Cheboksary study we give the results on Self-Compassion Scale, Future Self Scale and Death Attitude Profile Revised and Reasons for Living Scale. Results: Our studies show that though male university students (M=3,7, {SD}=1,37) differ from female students (M=4,06, {SD}=1,46) in fear of death: t(942) =-3,989,p{\textless}0,0001 (d(Cohen)=0,254, low practical significance), suicidals (both male and female) after an unsuccessful attempt fear death more than people in normal conditions, while people with suicidal thoughts (before the attempt) are characterized by relative fearlessness. The logistic regression showed that people in acute postsuicide, both males and females, differ from the normative sample. They exhibit higher fears of consequences of death for personality, avoidance of death in ordinary life, and depression, as well as higher negative past and lower approach-acceptance of death (belief in the afterlife): classification accuracy 78,3\% with the cutoff 0,5; R-Cox(2)=0,36, R-Nagelkerke(2)=0,48. Besides, analysis of differences of people with the denial of suicidal attempt (N=43), with one (N=105) and several suicidal attempts (N=37) and norm (N=156) with {ANOVA} Games-Howell post-hoc test showed a gradual escalation of negative time perspective, anxious style of attachment and depression, and decrease of hardiness with the raise of suicidal experience. Fears of death were elevated in all categories of suicidal patients, but in people with one suicidal attempt they were the most prominent, while acceptance of death was the most pronounced in people with several attempts. Moreover, results of a new study is provided (2016): there is a negative correlation of self-compassion with fear of death and fear of suicide. Conclusion: These facts suggest that fearlessness about death is a labile characteristic, a transient feeling, it's not permanent, but is dependent on other personal qualities and life events. One should consider this result in screenings along with the fearlessness of death in people with suicidal ideation, but without actual attempts. Non-suicidological questionnaires need to be included into screenings, as they can reveal general psychological ill-being and provide vectors for psychological correction. The last study also confirms the necessity to acknowledge the raise of the death fears in suicidal dynamics.","Chistopolskaya, K. A. and Enikolopov, S. N. and Nikolaev, E. L. and Magurdumova, L.

Objectives: To construct short Russian versions of Death Attitude Profile-Revised and Fear of Personal Death Scale. Method: A consolidated sample of 967 students of medical, technical and social sciences (457 males, 503 females, 7 undefined) from the cities of Moscow, Cheboksary, Ryazan and Tula, aged 16 - 37 (M=20.04, {SD}=1.87). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis was performed, on the basis of which short Russian versions of the questionnaires were constructed ({CFI}=.945, {SRMS}=.052, {RMSEA}=.054 for {DAP}-R, 18 items; {CFI}=.943, {SRMS}=.045, {RMSEA}=.060 for {FPDS}, 21 items). Norms for male and female students were calculated. Gender differences (t-test) of low and average statistical significance (Cohen's d) were found for most scales of both questionnaires. Females were higher in fears and acceptance of death (d(Cohen) from .233 to .556), except for Neutral Acceptance of Death, which was somewhat more pronounced in males (d(Cohen) = -.146). On the basis of correlation analysis the most benign scales were defined: Neutral Acceptance of Death, Fear of Consequences for Family and Friends; as well as the most adverse: Fear of Death, Escape Acceptance of Death, Fear of Consequences for Body, Fear of Being Forgotten. Conclusion: The article generalizes foreign and Russian research with the use of Death Attitude Scale-Revised and Fear of Personal Death Scale. Short Russian versions of the questionnaires are formed; their reliability, validity and internal consistency are confirmed.","Chistopolskaya, K. A. and Mitina, O. V. and Enikolopov, S.

1908,What is the causal relationship between death anxiety and religious belief?,"The virtues of Hilbert's mathematical problems - or, at least, the best of them - were that they were simply and unambiguously stated, enticingly difficult, and generated yet more advances in mathematics than just the solution of the problems themselves. In the spirit of Hilbert, albeit in empirical mode, we pose the following question to scholars of religion: What is the causal relationship between death anxiety and religious belief? This question we decompose into four sub-questions: Do people fear death? Does religiosity covary systematically with death anxiety? Does death anxiety cause or enhance religious belief? Does religious belief mitigate death anxiety? On the face of it, this focus on the fear of death seems parochial; it is indeed narrow in scope, but so were most of Hilbert's mathematical problems. Besides getting at a prominent intuition among laypeople and academics alike - that people are religious because they fear death - the route to answering our question will require scholars of religion to work together across disciplines, clarify our terms, design better measures and manipulations, and conduct cross-cultural research. Thus, as Hilbert put it, we believe that ""the gain which science obtains from the problem"" will be great.","Jong, Jonathan and Halberstadt, Jamin",0,,1892
1909,"Terminating a Child's Life? Religious, Moral, Cognitive, and Emotional Factors Underlying Non-Acceptance of Child Euthanasia","Is opposition to child euthanasia motivated only by ideology, or also by other personality characteristics and individual differences? In Belgium, the first country to legalize child euthanasia (in 2014), we investigated religious, moral, emotional, and cognitive factors underlying the (dis)approval of this legalization (N = 213). Disapproval was associated with religiousness, collectivistic morality (loyalty and purity), and prosocial dispositions, in terms of emotional empathy and behavioral generosity, but not values (care and fairness). It was also associated with low flexibility in existential issues and a high endorsement of slippery slope arguments, but not necessarily low openness to experience. A regression analysis showed that in addition to religiousness, low flexibility in existential issues and high empathy and generosity distinctly predicted opposition to child euthanasia. Whereas most of the findings parallel those previously reported for adult euthanasia, the role of prosocial inclinations in predicting moral opposition seems to be specific to child euthanasia.","Deak, Csilla and Saroglou, Vassilis",0,,1893

Results demonstrated that respondents displayed a moderate level of death anxiety. Multiple regression analysis further revealed that females, non-Caucasians and those who demonstrated to be less religious, indicated a higher level of loneliness, scored lower on the purpose in life scale, expressed dissatisfaction with their self-image, and reported a higher socio-economic status were found to exhibit a higher level of death anxiety.","Chow, Henry P.

1911,The Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model: How self-discrepancies drive consumer behavior,"Consumer goods and services have psychological value that can equal or exceed their functional value. A burgeoning literature demonstrates that one source of value emerges from the capacity for products to serve as a psychological salve that reduces various forms of distress across numerous domains. This review systematically organizes and integrates the literature on the use of consumer behavior as a means to regulate self-discrepancies, or the incongruities between how one currently perceives oneself and how one desires to view oneself (Higgins, 1987). We introduce a Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model to explain the psychological consequences of self-discrepancies on consumer behavior. This model delineates five distinct strategies by which consumers cope with self-discrepancies: direct resolution, symbolic self-completion, dissociation, escapism, and fluid compensation. Finally, the authors raise critical questions to guide future research endeavors. Overall, the present review provides both a primer on compensatory consumer behavior and sets an agenda for future research. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1912,"Functional and Dysfunctional Religious/Spiritual Beliefs in Psychotic Disorders - Processes of Believing: The Acquisition, Maintenance, and Change in Creditions","Many of religious/spiritual belief processes (as a possible form of ""creditions"") have been constantly demonstrated as being positively related to parameters of mental health, as well as to indicators of subjective well-being and personality factors. It has also been suggested that a religious/spiritual dimension might play an important role in coping with mental diseases. In particular, religion and spirituality were shown to be protective against addictive behaviours and suicide attempts. However, despite such findings, there have also been numerous instances of a religious person suffering from delusions and hallucinations. Furthermore, there is some evidence that dysfunctional religious/spiritual beliefs might have an aggravating effect, especially in neurotic, as well as psychotic, disorders. Currently, relevant empirical evidence is sparse and more research is needed in order to characterize the role of the religious/spiritual belief system more clearly as it may be part of the disease as well as part of the cure, or, indeed, simply irrelevant for its etiology. We aim to contribute to this ongoing discussion based on a synoptic review of recent findings, by focusing on the relationship between religious/spiritual belief processes and psychotic disorders.","Unterrainer, Human-Friedrich",0,,1896
1914,"Accessibility, priming, and political judgment","Classic and contemporary approaches to understanding political judgment implicitly acknowledged the role of chronic accessibility. Contemporary models also emphasize that situationally primed knowledge structures influence citizens' political attitudes and opinions. Priming effects are evident when specific concepts are primed (e.g., an issue, the American Flag, terrorism), and when media frames activate narratives that prime specific aspects of a political event. Metaphoric media frames (e.g., the presidential campaign is a horserace) can prime or highlight specific aspects of a political event (e.g., candidate electability) and thereby influence the public's attitudes and opinion (e.g., attitudes toward a political candidate). The immediate context in which political judgments are reported also produces priming effects on political judgment.","Ottati, Victor and Wilson, Chase and Lambert, Alan",0,,1897
1915,Primes as hidden persuaders,"Priming can increase the likelihood of retrieval from memory, facilitate the processing of encountered brands, determine product categorization, the encoding, and the weighting of the product attributes. Priming may also induce motivational, affective and cognitive states, which in turn affect product preferences. Primes can come in form of verbal or pictorial material, sounds, music, colour, or odours. They can be presented sub-liminally or supraliminally. Outside of the research lab they can be presented as part of the shopping environment, product communication or even as product-inherent features.","Waenke, Michaela",0,,1898
1916,Choosing Variety for Joint Consumption,"Consumers often make choices for joint consumption with committed relationship partners, and these choices may include more or less variety. When planning a weekend for oneself and one's spouse, for example, a person could choose more varied activities (e.g., going out to dinner, to a movie, and to a concert) or less varied activities (e.g., seeing several different movies). What might affect how much variety people choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption with the specific relationship partner. The findings demonstrate that variety preferences depend not just on personal or situational factors but also on aspects of consumers' social relationships.","Etkin, Jordan",0,,1899
1917,"I am not an animal but I am a sexist: Human distinctiveness, sexist attitudes towards women, and perceptions of meaning in life","Existential concerns relating to human physicality influence cultural worldviews and norms regarding women. When people are striving to bolster perceptions of meaning, they respond negatively to the aspects of the female body that serve as reminders that humans are animals. In the present research, we sought to further explore whether attitudes about human animality relate to attitudes about women. Specifically, we examined the association between beliefs about human-animal continuity and sexist attitudes. Since women serve as potent reminders that humans are biological creatures, we predicted that greater desire to perceive humans as distinct from other animals would be associated with higher levels of hostile and benevolent sexism among male participants. Results supported this hypothesis. We also tested and found support for the assumption that the belief that humans are distinct from and superior to other animals is associated with greater perceptions of meaning in life.","Roylance, Christina and Abeyta, Andrew A. and Routledge, Clay",0,,1900

1919,Belief in Foreign Supernatural Agents as an Alternate Source of Control When Personal Control Is Threatened,"Across four studies (N = 460), we examined whether foreign supernatural agents (i.e., ones outside one's own religious tradition) can serve as sources of secondary control (by hearing and responding to requests) and compensatory control (by imbuing the world with order and structure) when personal control is threatened. In Study 1, non-Buddhist control-threat participants believed in the Buddha as a source of secondary control more than nonthreat participants. In Study 2, control-threat participants believed in the Buddha as a source of compensatory control, but this effect was found only among those indicating a religious affiliation. Studies 3 and 4 clarified this finding, demonstrating that religious individuals with a strong quest orientation responded to control threat with greater belief in the Buddha (Study 3) and Shamanic ancestral spirits (Study 4) as sources of both secondary and compensatory control. We discuss discrepancies between our findings and extant research and offer directions for future research.","Boucher, Helen C. and Millard, Mary A.",0,,1902
1921,The effects of religion on consumer behavior: A conceptual framework and research agenda,"This article provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of religion on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research at the intersection of these two topics. We delineate religion as a multidimensional construct and propose that religion affects consumer psychology and behavior through four dimensions beliefs, rituals, values, and community. For each dimension of religion, we offer definitions and measures, integrate previous findings from research in the psychology, consumer behavior, marketing, and religion literatures, and propose testable future research directions. With this conceptual framework and research agenda, we challenge consumer researchers to ask deeper questions about why religious affiliation and level of religiosity may be driving previously established differences in consumer behavior, and to uncover the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects. This framework complements and extends previous literature and provides a new delineated framework for considering research on the effects of religion on consumer behavior.

1922,Taming Power: Generative Historical Consciousness,"Power is a necessary dimension of all human enterprises. It can inspire and illuminate, but it can also corrupt, oppress, and destroy. Therefore, taming power has been a central moral and political question for most of human history. Writers, theorists, and researchers have suggested many methods and mechanisms for taming power: through affiliation and love, intellect and reason, responsibility, religion and values, democratic political structures, and separation of powers. Historical examples and social science research suggest that each has some success, but also that each is vulnerable to being hijacked by power itself. I therefore introduce generative historical consciousness ({GHC}) as a concept and measure that might help to secure the benefits of power while protecting against its outrages and excesses. I conclude by discussing the role that {GHC} may have played in the peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.","Winter, David G.",0,,1904
1923,The relationships between family functioning and attachment orientations to post-traumatic stress symptoms among young adults who were evacuated from Gaza Strip settlements as adolescents,"Background and Objectives: This study examined post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) symptoms among young adults that were evicted from their residences in Gaza settlements (Gush Katif) as adolescents and actively participated in the resistance events. Furthermore, we examined the moderating role of exposure to forced relocation on the association between attachment orientations and family functioning and {PTSD} symptoms. Design: We conducted a correlative, cross-sectional study in 2013. Methods: Participants were Israeli evicted residents ({ER} group; N = 102), comparison groups of evicted nonresidents ({ENR} group; N = 27), and nonevicted nonresidents ({NENR} group; N = 53). All participants completed a battery of self-reported questionnaires. Results: The {ER} group reported a higher number of {PTSD} symptoms as compared to the comparison groups. However, {ER} participants did not differ from {ENR} and {NENR} participants in their perception of family functioning. Importantly, the group ({ER} vs. {NENR}) moderated the association between attachment-anxiety and {PTSD} symptoms and between family adaptability and {PTSD} symptoms. Conclusions: Nine years after the forced relocation from Gaza settlements, young adults that were evicted from their residences as adolescents suffer from {PTSD} symptoms that are more related to the relocation itself than the stress entailed in the resistance events.","Zerach, Gadi and Tam, Elkanor",0,,1905

In three studies, we evaluated the extent to which humility attenuates negative attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behaviors toward religious out-group members. In Study 1 (N=159), humility regarding religious beliefs was associated with positive attitudes toward religiously different individuals. In Study 2 (N=149), relational and intellectual humility were associated with less aggressive behavioral intentions in a hypothetical situation in which their cherished beliefs were criticized. In Study 3 (N=62), participants implicitly primed with humility administered significantly less hot sauce (a behavioral measure of aggression) to a religious out-group member who criticized their cherished views relative to participants in the neutral prime condition. We highlight the importance of humility in promoting positive attitudes and behaviors toward religious out-group members.","Van Tongeren, Daryl R. and Stafford, Joshua and Hook, Joshua N. and Green, Jeffrey D. and Davis, Don E. and Johnson, Kathryn A.",0,,1906
1925,Do I Fear Death? The Effects of Mortality Salience on Anti-Consumption Lifestyles,"How are individuals who voluntarily resist consumption affected by death thoughts? We looked at the impact of mortality salience ({MS}) on anticonsumption lifestyles. We found that high anticonsumption individuals were equally unlikely to consume in the control and {MS} conditions. However, low anticonsumption individuals were more likely to consume after death was made salient. Finally, anticonsumption lifestyles did not correlate with self-esteem, a known buffer of the effects of {MS}. Because {MS} did not change the consumption-related behaviors of high anticonsumption individuals, our findings suggest that consumption is not a relevant method for such individuals to recover their self-esteem. The findings also suggest that the adoption of an anticonsumption lifestyle buffers the effect of {MS} on participants' consumption-related behaviors.","Nepomuceno, Marcelo Vinhal and Laroche, Michel",1,,1907
1926,You Are the Real Terrorist and We Are Just Your Puppet: Using Individual and Group Factors to Explain Indonesian Muslims' Attributions of Causes of Terrorism,"The current study investigates the role of individual and intergroup factors in predicting Muslims' tendency to attribute domestic terrorism in Indonesia to an external cause (i.e., The West) or an internal cause (i.e., radical Islamist groups). The results (N = 308) showed that intergroup factors of symbolic threat and realistic threat directly increased the external attribution and conversely decreased the internal attribution. Within the context of the current research, symbolic threat refers to Muslims' perception that the norms and values of the West undermine Islamic identity. Realistic threat denotes Muslims' perception that the economy and technology of the West undermine Islamic power. The individual factor of Islamic fundamentalism, which has to do with Muslims' belief in the literal interpretation of and strict guidelines to Islamic doctrines, indirectly predicted both external attribution and internal attribution of terrorism as hypothesized, via the extent to which Muslims perceived the West as posing a symbolic threat, but not a realistic threat to Islamic existence. Uncertainty avoidance, a cultural dimension that describes the extent to which people view clear instructions as a pivotal source of concern to deal with societal problems, also significantly increased perceived symbolic threat and realistic threat, and this cultural dimension mediated the effect of Islamic fundamentalism on each of the intergroup threats. Finally, we found that the level of Islamic fundamentalism was dependent upon cognitive response, but not emotional response to mortality salience. The cognitive response to mortality salience denotes what Muslims are thinking about in coping with their own death whereas the emotional response denotes what Muslims are feeling about such issue. In particular, we found the cognitive response, but not the emotional response to mortality salience significantly gave rise to Muslims' Islamic fundamentalism. These findings shed light on the importance of combining individual factors and group factors in explicating the dynamics of Muslims' tendency to make attributions of causes of domestic terrorism. We discuss theoretical implications and study limitations, as well as practical actions policy makers could conduct to deal with Muslims' Islamic fundamentalism and reduce the extent to which this particular group perceives the West as threatening their existence.","Mashuri, Ali and Akhrani, Lusy Asa and Zaduqisti, Esti",1,,1908
1927,Emotional Responses to Images of Death: A New Category of Emotional Processing ?,"In the context of emotional states occurring during end-of-life processes, an understanding of emotional processing when facing stimuli associated with death would inform the study of whether these stimuli constitute a specific emotion schema whose adaptive value differs from the adaptive value of other negative and unpleasant stimuli. We investigated emotional processing when facing images of death and characterized this emotional processing according to the two-dimensional model of Peter Lang. For this purpose, a set of images of death was built and characterized along the dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance. The degree of suffering portrayed in each image was also categorized as high, medium, or low. We found that images of death cause an emotional response that differs from the response to other types of unpleasant images and that such processing depends on the degree of suffering portrayed in the image.","Marti-Garcia, Celia and Paz Garcia-Caro, M. and Cruz-Quintana, Francisco and Schmidt-{RioValle}, Jacqueline and Perez-Garcia, Miguel",0,,1909
1928,"Boosting Belligerence: How the July 7, 2005, London Bombings Affected Liberals' Moral Foundations and Prejudice","Major terrorist events, such as the recent attacks in Ankara, Sinai, and Paris, can have profound effects on a nation's values, attitudes, and prejudices. Yet psychological evidence testing the impact of such events via data collected immediately before and after an attack is understandably rare. In the present research, we tested the independent and joint effects of threat (the July 7, 2005, London bombings) and political ideology on endorsement of moral foundations and prejudices among two nationally representative samples (combined N = 2,031) about 6 weeks before and 1 month after the London bombings. After the bombings, there was greater endorsement of the in-group foundation, lower endorsement of the fairness-reciprocity foundation, and stronger prejudices toward Muslims and immigrants. The differences in both the endorsement of the foundations and the prejudices were larger among people with a liberal orientation than among those with a conservative orientation. Furthermore, the changes in endorsement of moral foundations among liberals explained their increases in prejudice. The results highlight the value of psychological theory and research for understanding societal changes in attitudes and prejudices after major terrorist events.","Van de Vyver, Julie and Houston, Diane M. and Abrams, Dominic and Vasiljevic, Milica",0,,1910
1929,"Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji","Threat of supernatural punishment can promote prosociality in large-scale societies; however, its impact in smaller societies with less powerful deities is less understood. Also, while perceived material insecurity has been associated with increasing religious belief, the relationships between insecurity, supernatural punishment beliefs, and prosocial behavior are unclear. In this study, we explore how material insecurity moderates the supernatural punishment beliefs that promote different expectations about distant, anonymous strangers among a sample of villagers living in Yasawa, Fiji. We examined this relationship by employing an economic game designed to measure local recipient favoritism vs. egalitarian, rule-following behavior. Using indices of three different punishing agents - the Christian God (Bible God), the deified ancestors (Kalou-vu), and the police - we find that increased belief in Bible God punishment predicts less local recipient favoritism at low and moderate but not high material insecurity. Punishing Kalou-vu also predicts less favoritism at low and moderate insecurity, but more favoritism at high insecurity. Police punishment poorly predicts favoritism, suggesting that secular authority has less impact on isolated communities. We discuss implications for understanding how different kinds of supernatural and secular agent beliefs impact prosocial behavior.","{McNamara}, Rita Anne and Norenzayan, Ara and Henrich, Joseph",0,,1911

Adolescents living in an attacked town (n = 259; M age = 16.19years, {SD} = 0.74years) and adolescents living in a not attacked town (n = 281; M age = 16.14years, {SD} = 0.69years) were studied longitudinally at 3weeks and 1year after the attack. Family identification promoted {SL} concurrently and {PSE} concurrently and longitudinally in both groups.

Logistic regression of survey responses from 2,299 participants from the United States (n=1,249) and the Netherlands (n=1,050) supported findings from previous research suggesting that homonegativity is more likely to occur in the United States than in the Netherlands, and that negative attitudes toward persons with {AIDS} and immigrants predicted homonegativity in both countries. Predictors of homonegativity in the United States included being male and being unemployed; in the Netherlands, being unhappy predicted homonegativity. How these findings inform social work policy and practice related to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ({LGBT}) population, as well as suggestions for future research, are discussed.","Haney, Jolynn L.",0,,1913
1938,"Materialistic Values and Goals - Annual Review of Psychology, Vol 67","Materialism comprises a set of values and goals focused on wealth, possessions, image, and status. These aims are a fundamental aspect of the human value/goal system, standing in relative conflict with aims concerning the well-being of others, as well as one's own personal and spiritual growth. Substantial evidence shows that people who place a relatively high priority on materialistic values/goals consume more products and incur more debt, have lower-quality interpersonal relationships, act in more ecologically destructive ways, have adverse work and educational motivation, and report lower personal and physical well-being. Experimentally activating materialistic aims causes similar outcomes. Given these ills, researchers have investigated means of decreasing people's materialism. Successful interventions encourage intrinsic/self-transcendent values/goals, increase felt personal security, and/or block materialistic messages from the environment. These interventions would likely be more effective if policies were also adopted that diminished contemporary culture's focus on consumption, profit, and economic growth.","Kasser, Tim",0,,1914
1940,{DIVINE} {FORGIVENESS} {AND} {HUMAN} {SUPPORT} {FOR} {STATE}-{SANCTIONED} {PUNISHMENT},"Laurin et al. 2012b found that beliefs in powerful Gods (both in general and when made salient) reduce people's endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment. Here we investigate whether the specific manner in which a powerful God responds to moral infractions (via forgiveness or punishment) influences people's endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment. Across four studies, we explored whether endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment is increased a) when participants are primed with the notion of a forgiving (cf. punitive) God (Studies 1 \& 2) and b) when beliefs in a forgiving God are made salient (Studies 3a \& 3b). A forgiving God might lead people to view punishment as their responsibility rather than one to be outsourced to God. Our results revealed no evidence for effects of for-giving God primes or salient forgiving God beliefs on endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment. However we did find that both forgiving and punishing God beliefs, when salient, were significant predictors of endorsement of state-sanctioned punishment in response to a victim-directed transgression. We discuss the implications of these findings for extant theories of religious prosociality. In particular, we suggest that existing accounts of human prosociality and cooperation have underestimated the role of divine forgiveness in favour of a focus on divine punishment.","O'Lone, Katherine M. and Mckay, Ryan T.",0,,1915
1941,Motivation for aggressive religious radicalization: goal regulation theory and a personality x threat X affordance hypothesis,"A new set of hypotheses is presented regarding the cause of aggressive religious radicalization ({ARR}). It is grounded in classic and contemporary theory of human motivation and goal regulation, together with recent empirical advances in personality, social, and neurophysiological psychology. We specify personality traits, threats, and group affordances that combine to divert normal motivational processes toward {ARR}. Conducive personality traits are oppositional, anxiety-prone, and identity-weak (i.e., morally bewildered). Conducive threats are those that arise from seemingly insurmountable external forces and frustrate effective goal regulation. Conducive affordances include opportunity for immediate and concrete engagement in active groups that are powered by conspiracy narratives, infused with cosmic significance, encouraging of moral violence, and sealed with religious unfalsifiability. We propose that {ARR} is rewarding because it can spur approach motivated states that mask vulnerability for people whose dispositions and circumstances would otherwise leave them mired in anxious distress.","{McGregor}, Ian and Hayes, Joseph and Prentice, Mike",0,,1916
1942,Living with terrorism or withdrawing in terror: Perceived control and consumer avoidance,"Terror attacks targeting civilians are becoming more frequent and affecting more places around the globe. Given the increasing intensity of terrorism and the threat of terrorism, consumer behavioral manifestations may occur. We conducted three studies with diverse methodologies and populations to explore how concerns with terrorism affect individuals' behavior. Two studies were conducted in Israel, a Western country that in the last decade experienced frequent terror attacks targeted at civilians. Results show that concerns with frequent terrorism increase people's desire for control and may lead to avoidant behaviors. The extent of the avoidance response depends on consumers' perceptions of whether they have some control over the odds of becoming a casualty should a terror attack occur. When individuals perceive their control to be low (but not high), they exhibit more avoidant behavior, changing their preferences and consumptions. We further find that individuals' general desire for control increases when they are primed with terrorist activities compared with general mortality.

1943,The Moderating Role of Personal Need for Structure on the Evaluation of Incrementally New Products versus Really New Products,"Previous literature about the impacts of product newness on consumers' acceptance of new products pointed out that consumers are more prone to purchase incrementally new products ({INPs}) than really new products ({RNPs}). This study investigated the moderating role of individual difference in personal need for structure ({PNS}) on consumers' evaluation of {INP} versus {RNP}. The inverted-U evaluation pattern of the schema congruity effect was predicted to be left-skewed for high-{PNS} consumers and right-skewed for low-{PNS} consumers as regards their evaluations of {INP} versus {RNP}. The results of Study 1 showed that low-{PNS} consumers evaluated {RNPs} higher than {INPs}. High-{PNS} consumers evaluated {INPs} higher than {RNPs} consistent with the prediction; however, the result was not significant. Relative to this issue, the moderating role of {PNS} on consumers' evaluation of {INP} versus {RNP} may have been affected by consumers' product category knowledge. The results of Study 2 verified the left- and right-skewed inverted-U hypotheses and showed that the moderating effect of {PNS} was evident only for novice consumers. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications from the results of the studies are discussed. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Kim, Jun San and Hahn, Minhi and Yoon, Yeosun",0,,1918
1944,The comfort of approach: self-soothing effects of behavioral approach in response to meaning violations,"People maintain systems of beliefs that provide them with a sense of belongingness, control, identity, and meaning, more generally. Recent research shows that when these beliefs are threatened a syndrome of negatively valenced arousal is evoked that motivates people to seek comfort in their ideologies or other personally valued beliefs. In this paper we will provide an overview of this process and discuss areas for future research. Beginning with the neural foundations of meaning violations, we review findings that show the anterior cingulate cortex is responsible for detecting inconsistencies, and importantly, that this is experienced as aversive. Next, we evaluate the evidential support for a psychophysiological arousal response as measured by cardiography and skin conductance. We discuss how current theorizing proposes that subsequent behavioral approach ameliorates the negative arousal and serves as an effective, well-adapted coping response, but we also aim to further integrate this process in the existing threat-compensation literature. Finally, we speculate on whether approach motivation is likely to result when one feels capable of handling the threat, thereby incorporating the biopsychosocial model that distinguishes between challenge and threat into the motivational threat-response literature. We believe the current literature on threat and meaning has much to offer and we aim to provide new incentives for further development.","Sleegers, Willem W. A. and Proulx, Travis",0,,1919

1948,From experiential psychology to consumer experience,"We comment on Gilovich and colleagues' program of research on happiness resulting from experiential versus material purchases, and critique these authors' interpretation that people derive more happiness from experiences than from material possessions. Unlike goods, experiences cannot be purchased, and possessions versus experiences do not seem to form the endpoints of the same continuum. As an alternative, we present a consumer-experience model that views materialism and experientialism as two separate dimensions whose effects on consumer happiness, both in the form of pleasure and in the form of meaning, depend on the type of brand experiences evoked. Thus, a good life in a consumerist society means integrating material and experiential consumptions rather than shifting spending from material to experiential purchases.

1949,The Ultimate Resistance,"Although resistance takes many forms, this article elucidates the primary source of resistance in psychotherapy as well as the fundamental resistance to leading a fulfilling life. The ultimate resistance to change, in both cases, originates in the anticipatory fear of arousing existential angst. To varying degrees, most individuals retreat from life and adopt defense mechanisms in an attempt to avoid reawakening suppressed feelings of terror and dread they experienced as children in early separation experiences, and, in particular, when they first learned about death. As clients dismantle their defenses during therapy and move toward increased individuation and self-fulfillment, these unconscious fears threaten to emerge into conscious awareness, and core resistances come into play. Certain events and circumstances, both positive and negative, arouse or intensify latent death anxiety, whereas other circumstances and defenses relieve it. There are numerous defenses that help ameliorate the core anxiety including the fantasy bondan illusion of connection or fusion with another person, persons, groups, or causesaddictions, microsuicidal behavior, and literal and symbolic methods of denying one's eventual demise. Although these defenses provide a measure of security and a sense of immortality, they adversely affect one's psychological adjustment, emotional well-being, and interpersonal relationships.","Firestone, Robert W.",0,,1923

The first is an analysis of culture and civilization as immortality projects, means by which to deny death. The second, which overlaps with the first, is a characterization of religion-as-practiced (e. g., by adherents of the world religions) as a particularly effective immortality project vis-a-vis death anxiety. The third is less social scientific and more theological; Becker argues for a view of God that is in the tradition of Soren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich (and, arguably, Pseudo-Dionysius, Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas). Focusing on the second of these projects-as much has already been written on the first, and little can be said about the third-this article evaluates Becker's claims about religion-as-practiced in light of recent developments in social cognitive psychology.","Jong, Jonathan",0,,1924

As predicted by Optimal Distinctiveness Theory, the intervention served to worsen evaluations of an in-group target vis-A -vis a control group that was not exposed to the intervention, and especially when applied on individuals possessing lower amounts of the in-group bias in question, ageism. Moreover, although age-based stereotyping and in-group bias against an older applicant was demonstrated, the intervention was found to have no effect in changing evaluations of an older target relative to the control group.

1952,The Calm before the Storm: Examining Emotion Regulation Consumption in the Face of an Impending Disaster,"In the midst of the physical damage and collective stress created by natural disasters, individuals come to terms with their utter lack of control. In the process, a myriad of emotions are experienced, with many of them being negative in nature. Research suggests that during moderately challenging situations individuals experiencing negative emotions may engage in coping attempts to improve their emotional state. Consumption has been one strategy used by individuals to mitigate negative emotions. This research extends previous research by exploring whether such emotion regulation processes occur in extreme conditions such as natural disasters. Specifically, it examines the emotions experienced by individuals, the antecedents of these emotions, as well as how individuals regulate their emotions through consumption. A conceptual model is proposed and tested in Study 1 and findings are once again corroborated in a follow-up study. Implications for mitigating negative emotions and improving subjective well-being during extreme crisis situations are discussed.","Kemp, Elyria and Kennett-Hensel, Pamela A. and Williams, Kim H.",0,,1926

1954,A Meaning-Based Approach to Humility: Relationship Affirmation Reduces Worldview Defense,"Humans are notoriously resistant to changing their longstanding beliefs and often act defensively when they encounter individuals holding divergent beliefs. We introduce a meaning-based approach to humility (e.g., reduced defensiveness) with the claim that the desire for meaning motivates individuals to ardently defend their central beliefs. We propose that affirming meaning prior to encountering attitudinally-dissimilar individuals should reduce defensiveness (e.g., less negative attitudes toward those who challenge their beliefs). Christian undergraduates (N = 79) were randomly assigned to a relationship affirmation, self-affirmation, or neutral priming condition, and then received negative feedback from an ostensibly antireligious individual (i.e., outgroup member) after writing an essay explicating their beliefs about an important social or cultural topic. Relationship affirmation reduced defensiveness via more positive ratings of the individual who derogated their beliefs, providing initial evidence for our theoretical approach. Implications for a meaning-based approach to humility are discussed.","Van Tongeren, Daryl R. and Green, Jeffrey D. and Hulsey, Timothy L. and Legare, Cristine H. and Bromley, David G. and Houtman, Anne M.",0,,1928
1955,'In the Way of Righteousness Is Life': Symbolic Death Transcendence in Proverbs 10-29,"While the book of Qohelet expresses significant anxiety over the prospect of death, the sages of Proverbs 10-29 scarcely exhibit a trace of death anxiety. Research in experimental social psychology suggests that such psychological equanimity about death is not accidental. Scholars often argue that Proverbs 10-29 envisions death as a 'universal fate' that encounters both the righteous and the wicked in the same way, but examining the text through the lens of Robert Lifton's work on symbolic death transcendence shows that a distinction is made between the post-mortem fates of the righteous and the wicked: the wicked are viewed as being utterly terminated by death while the righteous remain connected to life in multiple symbolic ways, primarily in the biological and creative modes. As a result, Proverbs 10-29 appears to function as an effective buffer against death anxiety, providing its adherents with the symbolic resources to face death with equanimity.","Williamson, Robert",0,,1929
1956,{ISLAMOPHOBIA} {AND} {EMPIRICAL} {REVISIONISM}: A {CRITIQUE} {OF} {BUKAY} {AND} {BOSTOM},"The end of the Cold War saw the Western media, the Christian right, and the pseudo-intellectuals working stridently to project a specific image of Islam - both repulsive and retrogressive in nature - in the consciousness of the West. This leads to a form of Islamophobia in which pseudo-intellectuals write about Islam, aiming to obscure its positive attributes, amplify its supposedly repressive values, and capitalize on those areas of civilizational incompatibility and conflict with the Judeo-Christian West. An objective analysis of this hype provides two interesting revelations. One, a deliberate attempt to rubbish Islam through exaggerated lies and distortion of historical reality. Two, create and perpetuate fear about Islam in the consciousness of the West which ultimately breeds the desire for exterminating Muslims due to the existential threat which they pose to the West. In this review, we critique the assertions embedded in this type of discourse using the books of David Bukay and Andrew Bostom. We also discuss the specific Islamophobic frame through which most of these writings that fall short of intellectual rigor. In the final analysis, we show that, owing to this failure to adhere to the basic principles of scientific research, these writings are intended to misinform rather than enrich the current discourse on Islam.","Abdelsalam, Elfatih A. and Katsina, Aliyu Mukhtar",0,,1930
1957,When bad gets worse: the amplifying effect of materialism on traumatic stress and maladaptive consumption,"Our research explores the amplifying effect of materialism on the experience of traumatic stress and maladaptive consumption via both an Israeli field study and a U.S. national survey. Our field study assesses the moderating impact of materialism upon both traumatic stress and maladaptive consumption among participants from an Israeli town under terrorist attack vs. participants from an Israeli town not exposed to hostilities. Our survey examines the possible underlying processes behind these effects among a nationally representative sample of Americans. The Israeli study reveals that, when faced with a mortal threat such as a terrorist attack, highly materialistic individuals report higher levels of post-traumatic stress, compulsive consumption, and impulsive buying than their less materialistic counterparts. Our U. S. study suggests that these effects are likely due to the fact that materialistic individuals exhibit lower levels of self-esteem, which reduces their ability to cope with traumatic events. Thus, our results indicate that, in addition to its well-documented harmful direct effect on psychological well-being, materialism also exerts an indirect negative effect by making bad events even worse.","Ruvio, Ayalla and Somer, Eli and Rindfleisch, Aric",0,,1931

Several evolutionary frameworks model the conditions under which prosocial behavior is evolutionarily viable, yet no unifying treatment exists of the psychological decision-making processes that result in prosociality. Here, we provide such a perspective in the form of the sociocultural appraisals, values, and emotions ({SAVE}) framework of prosociality. We review evidence for the components of our framework at four levels of analysis: intrapsychic, dyadic, group, and cultural. Within these levels, we consider how phenomena such as altruistic punishment, prosocial contagion, self-other similarity, and numerous others give rise to prosocial behavior. We then extend our reasoning to chart the biological underpinnings of prosociality and apply our framework to understand the role of social class in prosociality.","Keltner, Dacher and Kogan, Aleks and r and Piff, Paul K. and Saturn, Sarina R.",0,,1933

1964,The Two Dimensions of Motivation and a Reciprocal Model of the Creative Process,"Past research investigating the role of motivation in creativity has closely examined the role of intrinsic (i.e., process-focused) and extrinsic (i.e., outcome-focused) motivation. Results from this literature have shown that the effects of social factors on creativity (e.g., social inhibition or facilitation effects) are at least partially explained by their effect on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The present review seeks to broaden the scientific understanding of the role of motivation in creativity by proposing that a second dimension of motivation needs to be taken into account. In addition to creators' locus of motivation (i.e., whether they focus on the intrinsic process and/or extrinsic outcomes), creative behavior also appears to be driven by its intended beneficiaries (i.e., the self and/or others). Supporting the importance of this second dimension, recent empirical research has begun to investigate the relationship between prosocial motivation (i.e., the desire to contribute to other people's lives) and creativity. Thus, a combined look at research on these two dimensions of motivation highlights the bidirectional nature of the social processes at play in creativity: While studies investigating creators' locus of motivation have examined the influence of others on creators, recent studies considering creators' intended beneficiaries have stressed the importance of also understanding how creators wish to affect others in return. To integrate these two perspectives, we propose a reciprocal model of the creative process in which creators' general motivational orientations (falling along the dimensions outlined above) are translated into specific motivational goals, and we review possible psychological mechanisms explaining how motivation may guide creative cognition.","Forgeard, Marie J.

1965,The Existential Function of Intrinsic Religiousness: Moderation of Effects of Priming Religion on Intercultural Tolerance and Afterlife Anxiety,"Managing existential concerns is theorized to be a key function of religion. We posit that priming religion should be related to greater existential security for those high in intrinsic religiosity. In Experiment 1, priming religion increased intercultural tolerance among individuals who were highly intrinsically religious but decreased it for those low in intrinsic religiousness. In Experiment 2, intrinsic religiousness again moderated the effects of the prime, suggesting that priming religion resulted in attenuated afterlife anxiety for intrinsically religious individuals but greater anxiety for individuals low in intrinsic religiousness. Religious reminders appeared to provide existential securityevidenced by tolerance and reduced death anxietyonly to those high in intrinsic religiousness and can be threatening to those low in intrinsic religiousness. Existential outcomes are a specific case in which intrinsic religiousness can moderate the effects of religious primes, suggesting that religion plays a different existential role for different people.","Van Tongeren, Daryl R. and Raad, Jennifer M. and {McIntosh}, Daniel N. and Pae, Jessica",0,,1937
1966,"Perceived Primal Threat, Stress, and Health: Further Examination of the Role of Perceived Primal Threat in the Stress Process","The general aim of the two studies presented here was to further examine the role of Perceived Primal Threat ({PPT}) in the stress process. {PPT} refers to threats against a four-component set of interdependent primal needs: self-preservation, social integration, personal identity and growth, and personal worldview. These threats are suggested to represent a pathway through which stress affects health. The first study (cross-sectional) was conducted in a sample of 216 healthy adults, while the second (prospective) in a sample of 137 chronically ill outpatients. The findings of both studies underlined the incremental and discriminant validity of {PPT} in relation to other stress-related variables. Furthermore, they provided support to the hypotheses that {PPT} is independently related to well-being and also mediates the relation of the stressful condition to well-being. Overall, the two studies underlined the important role of {PPT} in the stress process and indicated that {PPT} represents a promising research area.","Karademas, Evangelos C. and Nikolaou, Pariana and Mermiga, Smaro and Psaroudakis, Alexios and Garipi, Christiana",0,,1938
1967,Using Motivation Theory to Develop a Transformative Consumer Research Agenda for Reducing Materialism in Society,"Materialism represents a pervasive value in contemporary society and one that is associated with multiple negative consequences. Although a considerable amount of research has documented these consequences, little research has examined how materialism levels might be reduced. This article presents a research agenda for reducing materialism. The authors begin with an overview of the motivation theory of materialism, a humanistic perspective that holds that materialism is often an outward manifestation of deeper unmet psychological needs and insecurities. Thus, research that contributes to reducing materialism should do so by addressing these more fundamental inadequacies. To this end, the authors outline three emergent research areas that have potential to reduce materialism by enhancing self-esteem-namely, experiential consumption, prosocial giving, and healthy social development in children. The authors review research in each area, consider its relevance to the materialism question, and propose future research directions. They also present the public policy implications of these discussions.","Burroughs, James E. and Chaplin, Lan Nguyen and P and elaere, Mario and Norton, Michael I. and Ordabayeva, Nailya and Gunz, Alex and Dinauer, Leslie",0,,1939
1968,Religiosity and Fear of Death: A Theory-Oriented Review of the Empirical Literature,"Do religious people fear death more or less than those who are nonreligious? According to two theories, religiosity and fear of death should be inversely correlated. A third theory suggests that moderately religious persons should be more fearful than those who are extremely religious or nonreligious. Yet a fourth theory predicts that religiosity and fear of death should be positively correlated. Eighty-four studies were located in which pertinent findings have been presented, several of which reached more than one conclusion based on different definitions of religiosity. Overall, 40 studies provided findings supporting the conclusion that religiosity and fear of death are inversely correlated, nine supported a curvilinear relationship, 27 supported a positive correlation, and 32 indicated that no significant relationship exists between religiosity and fear of death. Chi square analyses of several features of these conflicting studies suggest that there is probably a modest negative correlation between religiosity and fear of death among persons who are at least modestly religious. However, when nonreligious individuals are sampled alongside those who are both moderately and extremely religious, the overall relationship shifts to being curvilinear, and possibly even positive, depending on the aspect of religiosity being assessed. The implications of these conclusions for the four theories are discussed.","Ellis, Lee and Wahab, Eshah A.",0,,1940
1969,The effect of macroeconomic threats on brand value and ranking: Insights from 10 years of fluctuations,"This empirical study analyzes the evolution of international brands over a decade, in a quest to understand which type of macroeconomic event changes overall brand value and performance. The article extends earlier {IB} literature (Suder et al; Johansson and Dimofte, inter alia), and literature that links brand performance to macroeconomic phenomena, including financial crises, terrorism and warfare; it aims to provide a complementary means for formulating long-term corporate strategy in this field. The largest 100 brands are classified as one particular measure of international corporations 'global reach. Earlier studies employing this methodology found that ranking and value alterations in these brands raised crucial questions for {US}/non-{US} brand strategy. Today, more than a decade after 09/11 and in the midst of global financial turmoil, a longitudinal sample allows for extended analyses: these reveal the role of major geopolitical events and present crucial indications of an even greater impact on brands than those of financial crises.","Suder, Gabriele and Suder, David",0,,1941
1970,Aging and Attentional Bias for Death related and General Threat-related Information: Less Avoidance in Older as Compared With Middle-Aged Adults,"Objectives. The aging literature suggests that life satisfaction and affective well being stabilizes or even increases during the aging process, and that death anxiety would decrease with aging. Experimental psychology literature shows that emotions play a critical role in information processing. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether death related versus nondeath-related threat words would lead to differential attentional processing in middle aged versus older adults. Method. Twenty-seven older adults between 74 and 90 year and 31 middle-aged adults between 40 and 50 years participated in the study. We used questionnaires to asses death anxiety and an exogenous cueing task to measure attention toward death related versus general threat words. Results. Our results showed no age-related differences in self-reported death anxiety, but less attentional avoidance of threat in older adults. We failed to demonstrate differences between general and death-related threat. Discussion. This is the first study investigating attentional processing of both death- and threat-related information in older versus younger adults. Less avoidance from threat suggests that with aging, death becomes less of a concern, which might be indicative of acceptance of the own finiteness at old age.","De Raedt, Rudi and Koster, Ernst H.

1971,Self-Affirmation through the Choice of Highly Aesthetic Products,"Just as good looks bestow an unconscious ""beauty premium"" on people, high aesthetics bestows an unrecognized benefit on consumer goods. Specifically, choosing a product with good design affirms the consumer's sense of self. Choice of a highly aesthetic product was compared with choice of products superior on other attributes including function, brand, and hedonics to show that only aesthetics influences a consumer's personal values. In study 1 a prior self-affirming task leads to a decrease in choice share of a highly aesthetic option. Studies 2 and 3 mimic prior research on self-affirmation with, however, choice of a highly aesthetic product replacing a traditional self-affirmation manipulation. Choosing a product with good design resulted in increased openness to counter-attitudinal arguments and reduced propensity to escalate commitment toward a failing course of action. There are numerous implications of this form of self-affirmation, from public policy to retail therapy.","Townsend, Claudia and Sood, Sanjay",0,,1943
1972,"{RETRACTED}: Effects of Messiness on Preferences for Simplicity (Retracted article. See vol. 39, pg. {NIL}\_257, 2012)","This research examines the effect of experiencing messiness, induced by a messy environment or by priming the concept of messiness, on consumers. We propose that messiness is an aversive state and that consumers are motivated to attenuate this state by seeking simplicity in their cognitions, preferences, and choices. Six experiments support our theorizing. Experiments 1A-1C (conducted in the laboratory) and experiment 2 (conducted in the field) demonstrate that when messiness is salient, consumers form simpler product categorizations, are willing to pay more for a T-shirt with a simple picture, and seek less variety in their choices. Experiment 3 brings additional evidence for the underlying role of the need for simplicity by showing that when the need for simplicity is satiated, the effects of messiness disappear. A final experiment shows a boundary condition of the messiness effect: political conservatives are more susceptible to messiness primes compared to liberals.","Liu, Jia and Smeesters, Dirk and Trampe, Debra",0,,1944
1973,museums and mortality mark o'neill,"This article applies the idea that culture is a response to human awareness of mortality to museums through the lens of two contrasting approaches to understanding death and dying: Terror management theory ({TMT}), based on the work of Ernest Becker; and The Social History of Dying by Allan Kellehear. A composite theory is constructed and used to review some aspects of museum history and policy. An important factor in the origin of museums was ""death planning"" among private collectors who pressured the state to create institutions which could assure their afterlife through the preservation of their collections. While much contemporary theory sees museums primarily as hegemonic institutions, this suggests that they are only effective instruments of power if they carry out the primary cultural task of creating meaning in the face of mortality. Many recent museum policies claim that showing a range of cultures promotes understanding and tolerance. If, however, museums trigger unconscious awareness of death, these displays are as likely to generate intolerance. A recent development in the theory transcendence management however, suggests that, depending on how death awareness is triggered, the responses can be creative and open-minded rather than defensive or hostile. An important implication for recent controversies about the social impact and value of museums is that these effects can be the subject of experiment, and not just of speculation.","O'Neill, Mark",0,,1945
1974,The material and immaterial in conflict: Spirituality reduces conspicuous consumption,"Many spiritual leaders have argued that materialistic pursuits are incompatible with following a spiritual life. Consistent with this view, we found that higher levels of spirituality correspond to a decreased desire to consume material goods in a conspicuous manner. Study I was correlational, and found that people who reported having spiritual experiences reported a decreased desire to spend lavishly for visible consumer goods, such as a cell phone. Study 2 was experimental, and found that participants assigned to recall a spiritual event also demonstrated a decreased desire to consume conspicuously, relative to participants assigned to recall an enjoyable event.

1975,The preference for experiences over possessions: Measurement and construct validation of the Experiential Buying Tendency Scale,"There is growing support that money spent on experiential items increases an individual's happiness. However, there is minimal research on the causes and long-term consequences of the tendency to make experiential purchases. Given the importance of experiential buying for improving well-being, an understanding of the preference for experiential purchasing is imperative. Thus, we developed the Experiential Buying Tendency Scale ({EBTS}) to measure habitual experiential purchasing. Across eight samples (n=9634), the {EBTS} was developed, and shown to be reliable, valid, and predictive of consumer behavior and psychological well-being. An experiential purchasing tendency was related to higher extraversion, openness, empathic concern, and reward seeking. Further, non-materialistic values predicted a preference for experiential purchasing, which led to increased psychological need satisfaction, and, ultimately, increased subjective well-being. The discussion proposes that experiential purchasing may be a function of one's sensitivity to rewards, emotional responsiveness to events, and appreciation of the world's beauty.","Howell, Ryan T. and Pchelin, Paulina and Iyer, Ravi",0,,1947
1976,Revisiting the Salafi-jihadist Threat in Xinjiang,"The fear of a burgeoning Salafi-jihadism in Xinjiang has been a public driving factor in Chinese policies in the region. This menace is exaggerated. Though there may be Salafi-jihadist elements among the larger, discontented Uyghur population, it is not a mass movement posing an existential threat to the Chinese political order in Xinjiang. Nationalism fuels this Sino-Uyghur conflict while Islam functions as a pragmatic weapon. Uyghur Islam, Uyghur identity, and the history of Uyghur rebellions in the twentieth century, all undergird this conclusion. The form of Islam-Hanafi, Sufi, and indigenous customs-commonly practiced by Uyghurs is antithetical to Salafism and the state imposes constraints on religious praxis. A Muslim identity is only one among several competing identities that comprise the ethnic idea of a Uyghur. The character of Uyghur rebellions, even ones that blatantly declare jihad, demonstrates the primacy of nationalism, the absence of Salafi-jihadism, and the malleability of Uyghur identity. These three evidences bolster the case to revisit the question of Salafi-jihadism in Xinjiang and find a more complex socio-religious perspective.","Kuo, Kendrick T.",0,,1948
1979,"It's Only a Matter of Time: Death, Legacies, and Intergenerational Decisions","Intergenerational decisions affect other people in the future. The combination of intertemporal and interpersonal distance between decision makers in the present and other people in the future may lead one to expect little intergenerational generosity. In the experiments reported here, however, we posited that the negative effect of intertemporal distance on intergenerational beneficence would be reversed when people were primed with thoughts of death. This reversal would occur because death priming leads individuals to be concerned with having a lasting impact on other people in the future. Our experiments show that when individuals are exposed to death priming, the expected tendency to allocate fewer resources to others in the future, as compared with others in the present, is reversed. Our findings suggest that legacy motivations triggered by death priming can trump intergenerational discounting tendencies and promote intergenerational beneficence.","Wade-Benzoni, Kimberly A. and Tost, Leigh Plunkett and Hern and ez, Morela and Larrick, Richard P.",0,,1949

An extensive literature search, where 2,564 publications on terrorism were screened, resulted in 38 articles which were subject to further analysis. The results showed that while most of the theories and processes linked to Moghaddam's model are supported by empirical evidence, the proposed transitions between the different steps are not. These results may question the validity of a linear stepwise model and may suggest that a combination of mechanisms/factors could combine in different ways to produce terrorism.","Lygre, Ragnhild B. and Eid, Jarle and Larsson, Gerry and Ranstorp, Magnus",0,,1950

1982,The Chain of Being: A Hierarchy of Morality,"For centuries, philosophers, theologians, and scientists have used the idea of the Great Chain of Being to rank all beings, from demons to animals, humans, and gods, along a vertical dimension of morality. Although the idea of a chain of being has largely fallen out of academic favor, we propose that people still use an embodied vertical moral hierarchy to understand their moral world. This social cognitive chain of being ({SCCB}) encapsulates a range of research on moral perception including dehumanization (the perception of people as lower on the {SCCB}), anthropomorphism (the perception of animals as higher and the perceptions of gods as lower on the {SCCB}), and sanctification (the perception of people as higher on the {SCCB}). Moral emotions provide affective evidence that guide the perception of social targets as moral (e.g., elevation) or immoral (e.g., disgust). Perceptions of social targets along the {SCCB} enable people to fulfill group and self-serving, effectance, and existential motivations. The {SCCB} serves as a unifying theoretical framework that organizes research on moral perception, highlights unique interconnections, and provides a roadmap for future research.","Br and t, Mark J. and Reyna, Christine",0,,1952
1983,"Leaks, Lumps, and Lines: Stigma and Women's Bodies","Women's bodies have often been positioned in art and popular culture as monstrous or defiled and women's bodily products (e.g., menstrual fluid, breast milk) as disgusting. This framing has led to the stigmatization of aspects of women's bodies (e.g., leaking fluids, lumps of fat, and lines in the skin that indicate aging), especially those aspects that are perceived as threats to culture and society. In this article, the author draws on feminist theory, stigma theory, and terror management theory to explain the positioning of menstruating, fat, and old women as threatening and stigmatized. Evidence for the stigma is discussed, as are the effects of stigma on the stigmatized and the stigmatizers. Ways of resisting, reframing, and coping with stigma are suggested.","Chrisler, Joan C.",0,,1953
1984,Self-Regulatory Strength and Consumers' Relinquishment of Decision Control: When Less Effortful Decisions Are More Resource Depleting,"Using the self-regulatory strength model and prior research on self-esteem threats, the authors predict and show that delegating decisions to surrogates (e.g., financial advisors, physicians) depletes consumers' limited self-regulatory resources more than making the same decisions independently, thus impairing their subsequent ability to exercise self-control. This is the case even though decision delegation actually requires less decision-making effort than independent decision making (Study 1). However, the resource-depleting effect of decision delegation vanishes when consumers have an opportunity to affirm their belief in free will (Study 2). Moreover, when people remember a past decision that they delegated, their self-control is impaired more than when they remember a decision made independently (Studies 3 and 4). The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","Usta, Murat and Haeubl, Gerald",0,,1954
1985,The Postself and Terror Management Theory: Reflecting on After Death Identity Buffers Existential Threat,"In contemporary secular societies, ideas of an afterlife have become quite diverse, ranging from secular to religious and spiritual conceptions. In this article, an experimental study is reported in which the postself, a person's imagination of an after-death reputation, is tested as a protective buffer against mortality salience effects within a largely secular sample of participants. Before inducing mortality salience, the postself was affirmed or not affirmed. Results show that this reflection on personal continuity after death eliminates the effects of mortality salience on the accessibility of death-related thoughts. The discussion focuses on how the postself (the self will succeed death) relates to the more general concept of symbolic immortality (the self is part of a cultural worldview that will succeed death). Moreover, the relation between the postself and religiosity is discussed, and suggestions for future research are provided.","Wojtkowiak, Joanna and Rutjens, Bastiaan T.",1,,1955
1986,Mortality Salience and Positive Affect Influence Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Peers with Physical Disabilities: Terror Management and Broaden and Build Theories,"Attitudes toward teenagers with and without physical disabilities, and their social acceptance, were examined from the perspective of terror management theory and the broaden and build theory. Participants (n=390, aged 13-17) were divided into 3 experimental conditions: positive emotions, mortality salience, and control. Then, they were shown either a picture depicting an adolescent sitting on a regular chair or in a wheelchair and were asked to assess the characteristics of the person in the picture and their willingness to be in his or her company. The findings suggest that both types of manipulations enhanced the personality assessment and social acceptance of adolescents with disabilities compared to adolescents without disabilities and compared to the control condition. Girls reported more favorable attitudes toward another adolescent than boys did. The study indicates that seemingly contradictory manipulations may lead to social acceptance of adolescents with disabilities.","Taubman-Ben-Ari, Orit and Eherenfreund-Hager, Ahinoam and Findler, Liora",1,,1956

1988,The need to believe: a neuroscience account of religion as a motivated process,"Religious belief has been shown to offer substantial benefits to its adherents, including improved well-being and health. We suggest that these benefits might be explained, at least in part, from a ''motivated meaning-making'' perspective. This model holds that people are motivated to create and sustain meaning (i. e., a sense of coherency between beliefs, goals, and perceptions of the environment, which provides individuals with the feeling that the world is an orderly place), and that religious beliefs buffer the distress associated with disruptions to meaning, thus leading to decreases in distress. We further propose that religion's palliative attributes can be measured at the level of the brain, specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), which produces a ''distress signal'' upon the detection of errors, conflict, and expectancy violation. Using a social neuroscience paradigm, we investigate four main predictions that arise from this model: (1) religion should be associated with activation in the {ACC}; (2) religion should decrease activation in the {ACC}; (3) this attenuation of {ACC} activity should be related to religion's ability to buffer bodily states of distress, and not to decreases in motivation, attention, or control; (4) religion should have these effects because it provides meaning and thus buffers people from uncertainty. All predictions were supported, thus providing evidence, at the neural level, for the motivated meaning-making model's account of the salutary properties of religion.","Inzlicht, Michael and Tullett, Alexa M. and Good, Marie",0,,1958

In the present study, 123 Midwestern University undergraduates were reminded of their mortality and then asked to give their judgment of forgiveness in 10 different hypothetical scenarios. Individuals higher on intrinsic religiosity exhibited more forgiveness when reminded of their mortality than when they were not. This effect of mortality salience was not evident among those lower on intrinsic religiosity. These results extend the generality of a previous finding regarding forgiveness and existential anxiety and demonstrate forgiveness as a religious value for the intrinsically religious Christian. They also replicate findings that mortality salience can, in some circumstances, lead to an increase in prosocial behavior and attitudes.","Wilson, Keith M. and Bernas, Ronan",0,,1959

Of particular recent interest have been the correlates of materialism and their relationship to each other. This study examined the relationship between individual values, demographics, and materialism. Both self-enhancement and self-transcendence values were examined using data from a telephone survey with a random sample of 303 U.S. respondents. It was hypothesized that self-enhancement is positively related to materialism and self-transcendence is negatively related. The results suggest that the relationship between values and materialism is more complex than believed previously. Analysis of variance revealed several interactions that were of potential importance for both public policy and marketing strategy.

We discuss how people can utilize their relationships to organizations to craft their legacies. Further, we elucidate how the legacy motive can enhance business ethics, incorporating theory and empirical findings from research on intergenerational decision making, generativity, and terror management theory to develop the legacy construct and to outline the psychological underpinnings of motivations to leave a positive legacy. We discuss the ways in which legacies can provide a link between life-meaning and pro-social motivation, and we consider the ways in which individuals' social environments can moderate the intensity of the legacy motive and can impact legacy-building behavior by determining the types of legacies that are valued. Finally, we highlight the implications of these ideas for ethical behavior and sustainable decision making in business contexts.","Fox, Matthew and Tost, Leigh Plunkett and Wade-Benzoni, Kimberly A.",0,,1961
1992,Integrating the most unintuitive empirical observations of 2007 in the domain of personality and social psychology into a unified framework,"Two obstacles impede the development of productive theories in personality, social, and organizational psychology. First, the distinct frameworks are seldom integrated; the various theories sometimes yield incompatible implications. Second, because many findings in these fields seem intuitive, these observations do not augment the validity of these theories. To override these issues, this paper integrates the 70 most unintuitive findings of 2007 into a unified framework, derived from personality systems interaction theory. Specifically, 10 participants extracted the most unintuitive observations from 17 scholarly journals. These findings were reconciled within a single framework that generates 41 testable propositions. The framework assumes that an associative self system, underpinned by a vast network of schemas, governs behavior as well as enhances intuition, engagement, creativity, and cooperation. When individuals experience a threat, this system is inhibited, unless the requisite defense mechanisms to accommodate potential hazards have been developed. Furthermore, individuals attempt to distance themselves from unassailable threats, which activate an analytical system that formulates plans that could accommodate future contingencies. These plans are retained in memory or executed if individuals have acquired sufficient confidence. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1994,"Death, Life, Scarcity, and Value: An Alternative Perspective on the Meaning of Death","That the scarcity of objects enhances their value is a widely known principle in the behavioral sciences. In addition, research has demonstrated that attaching high value to an object produces biased perceptions of its scarcity. Three studies applied this bidirectional link between scarcity and value to the meaning of death, testing the prediction that death represents the scarcity of life. In Study 1, reminders of death led to enhanced evaluations of life. In Studies 2 and 3, the monetary (Study 2) and psychological (Study 3) value of life were manipulated. In both studies, when human life was highly valuable, the concept of death was more accessible, as predicted from the association between value and scarcity. Previous theoretical treatments of the meaning of death have shared the notion that death is essentially a threat requiring psychological defenses. The present results suggest that, from an informational perspective, death represents the scarcity of life.","King, Laura A. and Hicks, Joshua A. and Abdelkhalik, Justin",0,,1963

1996,On Being Rejected A Meta-Analysis of Experimental Research on Rejection,"This article presents the first meta-analysis of experimental research on rejection, sampling 88 studies. The results are consistent with a needs account, which states that rejection frustrates basic psychological needs, but not with a numbness account, which states that rejection causes physical and emotional numbness. Rejection moderately lowers mood (d = -0.50) and self-esteem (d = -0.70), but does not decrease arousal or flatten affect. Both belonging (d = 0.69) and control (d = 1.16) are frustrated by rejection. Aggressive responses to rejection, considered paradoxical by some, appear to be due to attempts to gain control; measures that contrast belonging and control (d = -1.17) cause antisocial responding, whereas measures that do not allow for control to be restored cause prosocial responding (d = 1.21). These findings suggest that rejection makes individuals feel bad-ready to act to restore control or belonging-and that they will prioritize restoring control even if it requires being antisocial.","Gerber, Jonathan and Wheeler, Ladd",0,,1965

We then examine different perspectives on how many (and what types of) dimensions individuals use to organize their political opinions. We investigate (a) how and to what extent individuals acquire the discursive contents associated with various ideologies, and (b) the social-psychological functions that these ideologies serve for those who adopt them. Our review highlights ""elective affinities"" between situational and dispositional needs of individuals and groups and the structure and contents of specific ideologies.

1999,{CSR}: the role of leadership in driving ethical outcomes,"Purpose - This paper aims to explain why {CSR} policies have failed to render organizations more ethical and to propose concepts for using {CSR} for improving the ethics of organizations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the literature on {CSR} to compare how gaps in this field of literature are similar to those in leadership theory. Findings - The paper posits that the different logical approaches to {CSR} are not necessarily ethical since ethics is based on the emotional involvement of the actor. The paper explains that leadership is not a hierarchical position but the emotional ability to follow one's worldview - either the Theta or Lambda worldviews - based on how one perceives his life purpose. The paper shows how to integrate knowledge from leadership theory to render the various {CSR} policies more ethical. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows the implication of the need for emotional involvement in research, in general. While the paper indicates a direction for how to integrate {CSR} policies into organizations, it does not provide examples. Originality/value - The paper argues for a definition of leadership as the ability to act authentically according to one's worldview, either Theta or Lambda. Based on this context, it provides a better definition of strategy and tactics while arguing that {CSR} is only applicable to the latter category.","Mostovicz, Isaac and Kakabadse, Nada and Kakabadse, Andrew",0,,1967
2002,On the Psychology of the Uncertain Self and the Integration of the Worldview Defense Zoo,"In this paper, I focus on two issues raised against the uncertainty management model that I proposed. The first issue has to do with the need for deeper insight into psychological processes instigated by uncertainty concerns, including the possibility of positive responses to uncertainty. The second issue revolves around the question to what extent uncertainty management is the core motive (vs. a core motive) of worldview defense and sense-making. By discussing these two issues, I hope to (a) make my view on uncertainty management processes clearer, (b) note explicitly that I was advocating a core motive of worldview defense (not the core motive), and (c) propose a research agenda for future research. I end the article with a plea for research studies that focus on moderators of worldview defense motives. These moderator studies may help to integrate the large variety of core motives proposed in the literature to underlie worldview defense strategies.","van den Bos, Kees",0,,1968
2004,The Case of the Transmogrifying Experimenter: Affirmation of a Moral Schema Following Implicit Change Detection,"The meaning-maintenance model posits that threats to schemas lead people to affirm unrelated schemas. In two studies testing this hypothesis, participants who were presented with a perceptual anomaly (viz., the experimenter was switched without participants consciously noticing) demonstrated greater affirmation of moral beliefs compared with participants in a control condition. Another study investigated whether the schema affirmation was prompted by unconscious arousal. Participants witnessed the changing experimenter and then consumed a placebo. Those who were informed that the placebo caused side effects of arousal did not show the moral-belief affirmation observed in the previous studies, as they misattributed their arousal to the placebo. In contrast, those who were not informed of such side effects demonstrated moral-belief affirmation. The results demonstrate the functional interchangeability of different meaning frameworks, and highlight the role of unconscious arousal in prompting people to seek alternative schemas in the face of a meaning threat.","Proulx, Travis and Heine, Steven J.",0,,1969
2005,Rest in peace? Brand-induced mortality salience and consumer behavior,"The present research examines the hypothesis that brands can automatically activate mortality-related thoughts and, in turn, affect consumer behavior. Terror Management Theory ({TMT}; [Greenberg Jeff, Pyszczynski Tom, Solomon Sheldon. The Causes and Consequences of a Need for Self-esteem: A Terror Management Theory. In: Baumeister Roy F, editor. Public Self and Private Self. New York/Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1986. pp. 189-192.]) predicts that brand-induced mortality salience leads to increased spending and worldview defense. The present findings show that explicit exposure to an insurance brand increases the accessibility of death-related thoughts, which, in turn, increases personal spending intentions (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 demonstrates that (implicit) insurance brand exposure positively affects charity donations. Additionally, the results of Experiment 3 reveal that subliminal brand exposure affects worldview defense in such a way that individuals who unconsciously observe an insurance brand rate domestic products more favorably and foreign products less favorably than individuals in the control condition. Brand associations can affect (unconscious) consumer behavior in various unanticipated ways. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

2006,Do children transcend death? An examination of the terror management function of offspring,"The concept of offspring provides a symbolic shield against the fear of death. The existential function of offspring was examined in two studies conducted in China employing real-life dependent measures. In Study 1, reminders of death through a word-completion task increased the disapproval of a birth-control policy in China. In Study 2, hospitalized patients generally preferred young family members more than other family members. Cancer patients showed this preference to a greater extent than non-cancer patients. Taken together, the findings showed that the death-anxiety-buffering function of offspring affects people's judgments and desires in real-life settings.","Zhou, Xinyue and Liu, Jing and Chen, Chengchao and Yu, Zonghuo",0,,1971
2008,"On the Role of Materialism in the Relationship Between Death Anxiety and Quality of Life - Advances in Consumer Research, Vol 35","The role of death anxiety as a factor in consumption behavior has received considerable attention recently. While death anxiety and materialism have been examined together, as have materialism and quality of life, the relationship between the three concepts simultaneously has not been tested. The purpose of this paper was to examine the three constructs in a single structural equation model to determine their direct and indirect relationships. It was shown that death anxiety did affect materialistic values which then influenced quality of life perceptions. There was no direct effect for death anxiety and quality of life.","Urien, Bertr and  and Kilbourne, William",0,,1972
2009,Coping with the threat of terrorism: A review,"Terrorism creates a ripple of fear and uncertainty. Although most individuals are resilient and recover over time, a minority remains functionally and psychologically impaired. In this paper, we examine research on coping strategies employed in the aftermath of terrorist events, theories and empirical findings related to appraisal processes that influence individuals' primary attributions of risk, and normative processes that shape secondary appraisals, which predict specific coping behaviors. We also describe individual diatheses and factors promoting resilience that may influence coping and functioning in the face of terrorism. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research.","Maguen, Shira and Papa, Anthony and Litz, Brett T.",0,,1973
2011,Spirituality and psychological well-being: A mediator-moderator study,"Research on the relationship between religiosity and psychological well-being is increasingly focused on identifying aspects of religious/spiritual involvement that have a beneficial effect on mental health and those that do not. This study examined the religion-well being link within a spiritual means-ends motivational framework utilizing two means dimensions and five ends dimensions. Both moderation and mediation effects were examined using regression analyses with a six-factor model of wellbeing (Ryff and Keyes 1995). Results indicated that spiritual means and ends variables have good ability to predict aspects of spiritual goals that may enhance or harm psychological well-being. Results also confirmed the ability of spiritual means to moderate the relationship between spiritual goals and well-being. Finally, examination of mediation effects revealed that only devotional means mediates the spiritual goals well-being relationship. Overall, the study demonstrated the utility of a means-ends framework for identifying relevant spiritual variables to add to our understanding of the religion-mental health link.","Fiorito, Basil and Ryan, Kathleen",0,,1974

We also propose that the body of research stimulated by attachment theory offers productive hints about interventions that might increase positive experiences and prosocial behavior by bolstering a person's sense of security. On this basis, we review recent experimental studies showing how interventions designed to increase attachment security have beneficial effects on mental health, prosocial behavior, and intergroup relations, and discuss unaddressed issues concerning the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of these interventions, the temporal course of these effects, and their interaction with countervailing forces.","Mikulincer, Mario and Shaver, Phillip R.",0,,1975

I suggest several ways by which one might attempt to advance literature concerning the horizontal/vertical distinction as well as our understanding of consumer psychology. In particular, I offer ideas about how pertinent methodological concerns might be addressed, how this stream of work may help predict certain consumer activities or interests, and some ways by which this body of literature can be applied to other domains of inquiry.

2017,General beliefs about the world as defensive mechanisms against death anxiety,"Death ideation and death anxiety represent the cognitive and affective dimensions of death attitudes, respectively. General beliefs about the world are proposed to be useful defensive mechanisms protecting persons against the death anxiety provoked by death ideation. {SEM} is employed to test the proposed mediation model, using a sample of 133 Hong Kong Chinese university students. Results showed that death ideation was significantly and inversely linked to belief in social cynicism, reward for application, and fate control. Moreover, higher levels of belief in fate control and lower levels of religiosity predicted greater death anxiety. Only belief in fate control partially mediated the relationship between death ideation and death anxiety. Discussion focused on how social axioms serve as useful defensive mechanisms against death anxiety.","Hui, Victoria Ka-Ying and Bond, Michael Harris and Ng, Timmy Sze Wing",0,,1978

On the basis of terror management theory and previous research, we hypothesized that people would show increased preference for a charismatic political candidate and decreased preference for a relationship-oriented political candidate in response to subtle reminders of death. Following a mortality-salience or control induction, 190 participants read campaign statements by charismatic, task-oriented, and relationship-oriented gubernatorial candidates; evaluated their preferences for each candidate; and voted for one of them. Results were in accord with predictions. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are considered.","Cohen, F. and Solomon, S. and Maxfield, M. and Pyszczynski, T. and Greenberg, J.",0,,1979
2019,Attitudes toward women's body hair: Relationship with disgust sensitivity,"We aimed to further investigate the ""hairlessness"" norm that is the common practice of body hair removal among women. A sample of 198 undergraduate students (91 men, 107 women) completed questionnaires asking about attitudes toward women's body hair and the reasons women remove this hair, as well as a measure of disgust sensitivity. It was found that the vast majority (98\%) of female participants regularly remove their leg and/or underarm hair, most frequently by shaving and attribute this to femininity and attractiveness reasons. However, the attributions that they and men made for other women were much more socially normative in nature. For the sample as a whole, negative attitudes toward body hair were related to disgust sensitivity. It was concluded that body hair on women, but not on men, has become an elicitor of disgust and its removal correspondingly normative.","Tiggemann, M. and Lewis, C.",0,,1980
2020,Intimacy and risky sexual behavior - What does it have to do with death?,"The current series of studies was conducted to explore the interplay between death awareness, fear of intimacy, and unsafe sex. In Study 1 (n = 73), making mortality salient led to higher willingness to engage in risky sexual behaviors, in comparison to a control condition. In addition, only in the mortality silence condition, lower fear of intimacy was associated with higher sexual risk laking. Moreover, higher accessibiliy of death-related thoughts was found either following induction of thoughts about risky sex in Study 2 (n = 68), or upon the induction of thoughts about fear of intimacy in Study 3 (n = 74), in comparison to the induction of thoughts about a neutral theme. The findings extended Terror Management Theory to the realm of risky sexual behavior and are discussed in view of the terror management function of close relationships.","Taubman-Ben-Ari, O.",0,,1981

Lacking a comprehensive model or formal theory up to now, the construct has been underused. This article advances theory by addressing these gaps. Worldview is defined. Major approaches to worldview are critically reviewed. Lines of evidence are described regarding worldview as a justifiable construct in psychology. Worldviews are distinguished from schemas. A collated model of a worldview's component dimensions is described. An integrated theory of worldview function is outlined, relating worldview to personality traits, motivation, affect, cognition, behavior, and culture. A worldview research agenda is outlined for personality and social psychology (including positive and peace psychology).","Koltko-Rivera, M. E.",0,,1982

We explore the utility of viewing {MS} effects from an information processing perspective and discuss the implications for understanding consumer behavior. We suggest that a better understanding of the motivational nature of {MS} and the underlying processes could provide additional insights on the persuasive impact of {MS}. We also anticipate effects of {MS} to differ across cultures and predict some novel outcomes. Finally, we outline several potential avenues for investigating {MS} effects in consumer domains such as branding and advertising.","Maheswaran, D. and Agrawal, N.",0,,1984
2024,Cigarette smoking and fear of death: Explaining conflicting results in death anxiety research,"The purpose of these studies was to examine the relationship between death anxiety and smoking, and to explain the conflicting results of previous studies on this topic. In Study 1, students at a rural university were given a death anxiety scale and a measure of smoking behavior, counterbalanced for order. The same questionnaires were given to urban adolescents in Study 2. When college student smokers thought about their smoking behavior first, those who had smoked more recently showed higher death anxiety. Among high school students who had smoked, those with higher death anxiety reported smoking fewer cigarettes. In addition, mortality salience, induced by completing the death anxiety scale first, caused these high school students to report smoking less frequently. An integration of the results of the two studies with earlier research suggests that order effects and urban-rural differences can explain inconsistencies in the link between death anxiety and smoking.","Kain, K. and Nelson, L.

2025,Proximal and distal defense: A new perspective on unconscious motivation,"Death-related thoughts produce different effects on thought and behavior when they are in current focal attention and when they are on the fringes of consciousness. When such thoughts are conscious, people attempt to either remove them from consciousness or pus death into the distant future by distorting their beliefs to logically imply that they have many remaining years to live. When such thoughts are highly accessible but outside current focal attention, people increase efforts to view themselves as person of value living in a meaningful universe. In this way, awareness of the inevitability of death produces diverse effects on human thought and behavior that bear little obvious resemblance to the problem of death.","Pyszczynski, T. and Greenberg, J. and Solomon, S.",0,,1986

2027,Tales from the crypt: On the role of death in life,"An existential psychodynamic theory is presented based on Ernest Becker's claim chat self-esteem and cultural world-views function to ameliorate the anxiety associated with the uniquely human awareness of vulnerability and mortality. psychological equanimity is hypothesized to require (1) a shared set of beliefs about reality that imbues the universe with stability, meaning, and permanence; (2) standards which individuals can judge themselves to be of value; and (3) promises of safety and the transcendence of death to those who meet the standards of value. An empirical research program in support of this theory is then described, and the personal and interpersonal implications of these ideas are briefly considered.","Solomon, S. and Greenberg, J. and Pyszczynski, T.",0,,1988
2028,Ernest Becker and the psychology of worldviews,"Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski offer experimental confirmation for Ernest Becker's claim that the fear of death is a powerful unconscious motive producing polarized worldviews and scapegoating. Their suggestion that their findings also prove Sigmund Freud's theory of repression, with worldviews as its irrational products, is questionable, although Becker's own statements about worldviews as ""illusions"" seem to invite such interpretation. Their basic theory does not depend on this, however, and abandoning it would enable them to take better advantage of their finding that worldviews incorporating the values of rationality and tolerance tend to counteract polarization effects.","Webb, E.",0,,1989
2030,Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety,"An integrative, comprehensive model of death anxiety is presented. The model postules three immediate antecedents of death anxiety: past-related regret, future-related regret, and meaningfulness of death. Past-related regret refers to a person's unfulfilled aspirations that should have been achieved but were not. Future-related regret refers to the anticipation that, as a result of premature death, one cannot achieve important goals in the future. Meaningfulness of death refers to one's concept of death and ability to make sense of it. These three antecedents are related to death salience in a complex way, mediated by coping mechanisms and their effects on one's beliefs about self and the world. The coping mechanisms include (but are not necessarily limited) life review, life planning, identification with culture, and self-transcending processes. The model's development and practical applications are explored.","Tomer, A. and Eliason, G.",0,,1990
2031,Influence of terror perceptions on individual investment behaviors: examining the moderating effects of present hedonic time perspective and consumer gender,"Purpose The argument that terror perception and individual time perspectives can affect behaviors has become increasingly relevant. This study analyzed the association of terror perception with financial risk and developed an integrated framework of the interaction between terror perception (mortality salience) and time perspective to determine risky investment. People with different time perspectives have different acknowledgments of risk. Two studies of terror perception leading to more or less risky investment choices supported this framework to demonstrate that individuals exhibit more (less) risky investment behavior when terror perception is salient and they have a high (low) present hedonic time perspective. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments were performed. Study 1 tested whether {TP} moderates the effects of terror priming (aging) on risky financial investment. Study 2 tested the effects of terror priming on risky financial investment decisions and the role of gender and the present hedonic {TP} ({PH}) in moderating these effects. The following hypotheses were then developed: H1: Participants with high {PH} primed with the aging condition will select riskier financial investments than those with low {PH} will (Study 1). H2: Male participants with higher {PH} primed in the death condition will select riskier financial investments than those in the control condition will (Study 2). Findings Because people with different {TPs} acknowledge risk differently, this article developed a new framework modeling {MS} on {TP} in risky investment selection. Two studies representative of {MS} affecting risky investment decision-making were conducted to test the framework. The results of the two studies indicated that individuals engaged in risky investment behavior more (less) when mortality was salient and the individual had high (low) {PH}. Moreover, gender influences these results. As anticipated, male participants with higher {PH} in the death-primed condition selected riskier financial investment than those in the control condition did. Additional research from a broader perspective is warranted. Originality/value Many psychological factors of risky decision-making have been discussed, such as motivational systems or situational motivation, self-framing, control orientation, sensation seeking, dishonesty, and ambiguity (Sekscinska et al., 2016). However, few studies have examined temporal framing, also known as time perspective ({TP}), the psychological concept of a person's relationship with time. This study mainly discusses the effects of terror perception on risky financial decisions by using a theoretical framework based on {TP}, which influences the effects of {MS} on risky financial decision-making. When mortality is made salient, individuals with present hedonic {TP} have behaviors characterized by risk perception. Those with present hedonic {TP} are more likely to make risky financial investments because they prefer present pleasure and risk over future outcomes (Zimbardo and Boyd, 2015).","Chen, Jing-Yi",1,,1991
2032,Existential Public Value,"The most existential public value is the maintenance of an environment in which mankind can at least survive. Climate change is an emergent existential threat. This article draws on the author's contribution to a workshop that examined the understanding of public value and its relevance to theory and practice of public policy. Its methodology links thinking, jurisprudence, and practice in the responsibilities of public officers with the public administration concept of public value. Accordingly, public administration is executed by public officers who have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the people represented, and responsibilities under the public trust principle which entrust them with responsibility for the polity's common good. Selected recent instances demonstrate increasing recognition by superior courts that public administrators have responsibilities to foster the creation of existential public value. Public administration scholars have opportunity and responsibility to promote these responsibilities.","Coghill, Ken",0,,1992
2033,The Interaction of Extremist Propaganda and Anger as Predictors of Violent Responses,"In this study, and with a view to extending upon existing findings on the effects of general violent media on violent cognitions, we experimentally measured the relationship between exposure to extremist propaganda and violent cognitions. Our results countered our hypotheses and the wider findings of violent media and aggression that exposure to violent stimuli increases violent thoughts and that this effect is moderated by trait aggression. Specifically, this study found that participants with low and medium trait aggression became more pro-social after being exposed to extremist propaganda. We discuss these results with reference to theories of terror management and mortality salience, as well as the implications of these results for wider theories of the role of online extremist material in the wider ""radicalization"" process.","Shortl and , Neil and Nader, Elias and Imperillo, Nicholas and Ross, Kyrielle and Dmello, Jared",0,,1993
2034,Anxiety buffers and the threat of extreme automation: a terror management theory perspective,"Purpose The advent of extreme automation from new technologies such as artificial intelligence portends a massive increase in unemployment. The psychological impact of this threat on the workforce is critically important. This paper aims to examine the functioning of individuals' anxiety buffers in response to this threat. Design/methodology/approach A two-stage mixed-methods design is used. In stage 1, qualitative data are gathered through semi-structured interviews. In stage 2, quantitative data are collected through two experiments to assess the psychological impact of exposure to the threat. Findings Exposure to the threat of extreme automation reduces self-esteem, faith in the worldview and attachment security. When self-esteem and attachment security are under attack, they are ineffective as anxiety buffers, and anxiety levels increase. Additionally, there is a distal effect such that during a period of distraction, the threatened anxiety buffers are reinforced and return to their normal levels. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to a homogenous culture in which work is highly salient. Future research should include other cultures, other methods of exposure and further examine the distal effects. Originality/value The study examines the previously underexplored issue of individuals' psychological response to the impending changes in the workforce because of technological advancements.","Goethals, Frank and Ziegelmayer, Jennifer L.",0,,1994
2035,"Local existential threat, authoritarianism, and support for right-wing populism","Drawing on terror management theory, the present study examines how local existential threat and authoritarian dispositions work together to shape public support for Mr. Trump and elements of more general right-wing populist rhetoric. Based on a national sample from early 2017, the results show that white authoritarians are especially likely to view Mr. Trump as a strong leader, support restrictions on the liberties of cultural minorities and embrace returning 'power to the people.' However, in areas with moderate or high levels of local existential threat - as measured by age-adjusted county mortality rates - non-authoritarians hold the same attitudes as authoritarians. This occurs because threatened non-authoritarians become more like authoritarians in their right-wing populist views. The importance of existential threat is further validated by showing that the attitudes of non-authoritarians in poor health were indistinguishable from authoritarians, even in counties with low mortality rates.","Hinckley, Robert A.",0,,1995
2036,"Ballots, bombs, and bullets: the effects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks on electoral behavior","The attitudinal effects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks are well documented, but their electoral consequences have not been studied systematically in the American context. We derive a set of expectations about mass violence and electoral behavior from terror management theory and issue ownership theory. We then examine the effects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks on United States presidential elections from 1976 through 2016. We find mass shootings increase turnout in the counties where they occur. Furthermore, terrorist attacks reduce the Democratic presidential candidate's shares of the two-party vote at the county level. Both of these effects decay sharply as the time between the event and Election Day increases. These findings illustrate the power of mass violence to influence American electoral behavior, conditional on the type of violent event and its proximity to Election Day.","Kantack, Benjamin R. and Lassi, Thomas",0,,1996
2037,Personality and Social Psychology Approaches to Religious and Spiritual Development in Adolescents,"The fields of personality and social psychology, with their focus on individual differences and human communalities, have much to offer the study of religious and spiritual development in adolescence. This review describes the ways {McAdams} and Pals' comprehensive personality theory and Saroglou's Big Four functional account of religion inform the scientific understanding of adolescents' religious and spiritual development. These theories suggest religious/spiritual development of adolescents should be studied at three levels of personality (traits, characteristic adaptations, and narrative identity/objective biography) and account for the potential functions of religion in relation to behaving (moral), believing (cognitive), belonging (social), and bonding (emotional) across diverse cultural contexts. The utility of these theories for investigating adolescent religious/spiritual development is illustrated through description of empirical studies and lines of research based on methodologies commonly employed in personality and social psychology, including longitudinal studies, religious priming experiments, and experience sampling methods. Likewise, this review highlights areas for future investigation and provides specific suggestions for inquiry on adolescent religious/spiritual development, which include deploying experimental designs, merging narrative identity with identity status approaches, and adopting a more holistic view of traits through analysis of experience sampling data.","Schnitker, Sarah A. and Williams, Emily G. and Medenwaldt, Jay M.",0,,1997
2038,Perceived stress and sleep quality among the non-diseased general public in China during the 2019 coronavirus disease: a moderated mediation model,"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) has spread worldwide, and its associated stressors have resulted in decreased sleep quality among front-line workers. However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. Methods: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18-25, 2020 with 1630 Chinese participants (aged 18-68 years). Results: Around one-third (36.38\%) of participants were poor sleepers during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

2039,Climate Policy Imbalance in the Energy Sector: Time to Focus on the Value of {CO}2 Utilization,"Global warming is an existential threat to humanity and the rapid energy transition, which is required, will be the defining social, political and technical challenge of the 21st century. Practical experience and research results of recent years have showed that our actions to cover the gap between real situation and aims of climate agreements are not enough and that improvements in climate policy are needed, primarily in the energy sector. It is becoming increasingly clear that hydrocarbon resources, which production volume is increasing annually, will remain a significant part of the global fuel balance in the foreseeable future. Taking this into account, the main problem of the current climate policy is a limited portfolio of technologies, focused on replacement of hydrocarbon resources with renewable energy, without proper attention to an alternative ways of decreasing carbon intensity, such as carbon sequestration options. This study shows the need to review the existing climate policy portfolios through reorientation to {CO}2 utilization and disposal technologies and in terms of forming an appropriate appreciation for the role of hydrocarbon industries as the basis for the development of {CO}2-based production chains. In this paper we argue that: (1) focusing climate investments on a limited portfolio of energy technologies may become a trap that keeps us from achieving global emissions goals; (2) accounting for greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions losses, without taking into account the potential social effects of utilization, is a barrier to diversifying climate strategies; (3) with regard to hydrocarbon industries, a transition from destructive to creative measures aimed at implementing environmental projects is needed; (4) there are no cheap climate solutions, but the present cost of reducing {CO}2 emissions exceeds any estimate of the social cost of carbon.","Tcvetkov, Pavel",0,,1999
2040,Factors Associated with Death Anxiety Among Rural Chinese Older Adults: The Terror Management Perspective,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine how the factors suggested by the Terror Management Theory are associated with death anxiety among rural Chinese older adults. Method: Data were derived from a longitudinal survey of older adults aged 60 and above, had at least one living child, and were living in rural areas of Anhui Province. The working sample included 1,362 older adults. Two-level random effects models were used. Results: Children's financial support was negatively related to death anxiety, whereas emotional closeness with children was positively related to death anxiety. Older women reported more death anxiety than older men. Functional limitations were positively associated with death anxiety, and the widowed reported less death anxiety than the married. We did not find a significant association between religious belief and death anxiety. Discussion: The study highlights the importance of culture in shaping death anxiety among older adults in rural China.","Pei, Yaolin and Cong, Zhen and Silverstein, Merril and Li, Shuzhuo and Wu, Bei",0,,2000
2041,The fifth-place metamorphosis: the impact of the outbreak of {COVID}-19 on typologies of places in post-pandemic Cairo,"Purpose - The world has recently faced the outbreak of an existential threat. Since December 2019, many aspects of life have changed owing to a devastating pandemic, {COVID}-19. The second wave started spreading in different parts of the globe. This article focuses on the impact of {COVID}-19 on Cairo city, regarding three upper-middle-class districts as a case study. Based on a literature review, a theoretical framework is proposed to analyse how residents changed their living, work, and leisure time habits during the outbreak of the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach - A retrospective survey was conducted among the residents of three districts to investigate the new living model of adaptive, spontaneous urban and architecture design tactics that transfer people's actual life, work, and leisure arrangements into future planning considerations. Findings - The results reveal relevant observations about the adaptation of the existing environments of home, work, and leisure activities. From these results, different considerations and new norms emerge for housing typologies in post-pandemic Cairo. Originality/value - The conclusions of this study introduced the new term ""the fifth place"" as a space-time place that could serve as a motivation for urban designers and architects to design space typologies considering the emerging circumstances.","Abd Elrahman, Ahmed S.",0,,2001
2042,From public good to public value: arts and culture in a time of crisis,"This paper argues that the crisis sweeping over the Australian cultural sector as a result of {COVID}-19 presents an existential threat to current (""normal science"") methods of evaluation, and to instrumental, predominantly economic, understandings of value. Outlining ways the concept of value is changing, we respond to Mariana Mazzucato's call to go ""from public goods to public value"" in considering the role of government policy in key sectors of society. We note the broader approach to value called for by a range of mainstream economists and provide three recent examples of challenges to existing evaluation methods in the Australian cultural sector. In conclusion, we touch on the essential features of a re-constructed category of public value and the implications for value research.

2043,Struggles in defense of life within the context of dispossession and capitalist violence in Mexico: a closer look through the lens of the production of the common,"Indigenous and peasant communities in Latin America face an extractivist offensive characterized by multiple processes of dispossession and violence. These processes pose an existential threat to the territorial resources and means of existence that ensure sustenance and facilitate reproduction of life for both humans and non-humans. In this text, I provide a brief overview of the emergence of the Mexican indigenous movement in the 1990s and the recent proliferation of indigenous and peasant struggles focused on the defense of life. Deploying the central concepts of 'production of the common' and 'entramados comunitarios', I analyze the dynamics of community organization and struggle in response to the onslaught and consequences of extractivism.","Navarro Trujillo, Mina Lorena",0,,2003
2044,The Impact of {COVID}-19 and Public Health Emergencies on Consumer Purchase of Scarce Products in China,"Objectives: During public health emergencies, people often scramble to buy scarce goods, which may lead to panic behavior and cause serious negative impacts on public health management. Due to the absence of relevant research, the internal logic of this phenomenon is not clear. This study explored whether and why public health emergencies such as the {COVID}-19 pandemic stimulate consumers' preference for scarce products. Methods: Applying the questionnaire survey method, two online surveys were conducted on the Credamo data platform in China. The first survey was launched in February and collected psychological and behavioral data from 1,548 participants. Considering the likelihood of population relocation due to the pandemic, a follow-up survey was conducted in August with 463 participants who had participated in the first survey and had not relocated to other cities between February and August. The hypotheses were tested with these data through stepwise regression analysis, bootstrapping, and robustness testing. Results: Pandemic severity was found to positively affect scarce consumption behavior and the effect was found to be situational; this indicates that the impact of the pandemic on scarce consumption was only significant during the pandemic. Further, it was found that materialism plays a mediating role in the relationship between pandemic severity and scarce consumption. Finally, the need to belong was found to play a moderating role between pandemic severity and materialism. Conclusion: This study findings imply that the scarce consumption behavior during public health emergencies can be reduced by decreasing materialism and increasing the need to belong. These findings may aid government leaders in managing public health emergencies.","Jin, Xiaotong and Li, Jianan and Song, Wei and Zhao, Taiyang",0,,2004
2045,Posterior medial frontal cortex and threat-enhanced religious belief: a replication and extension,"Research indicates that the posterior medial frontal cortex ({pMFC}) functions as a 'neural alarm' complex broadly involved in registering threats and helping to muster relevant responses. Holbrook and colleagues investigated whether {pMFC} similarly mediates ideological threat responses, finding that downregulating {pMFC} via transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) caused (i) less avowed religious belief despite being reminded of death and (ii) less group bias despite encountering a sharp critique of the national in-group. While suggestive, these findings were limited by the absence of a non-threat comparison condition and reliance on sham rather than control {TMS}. Here, in a pre-registered replication and extension, we downregulated {pMFC} or a control region ({MT}/V5) and then primed participants with either a reminder of death or a threat-neutral topic. As mentioned previously, participants reminded of death reported less religious belief when {pMFC} was downregulated. No such effect of {pMFC} downregulation was observed in the neutral condition, consistent with construing {pMFC} as monitoring for salient threats (e.g. death) and helping to recruit ideological responses (e.g. enhanced religious belief). However, no effect of downregulating {pMFC} on group bias was observed, possibly due to reliance on a collegiate in-group framing rather than a national framing as in the prior study.","Holbrook, Colin and Iacoboni, Marco and Gordon, Chelsea and Proksch, Shannon and Balasubramaniam, Ramesh",0,,2005
2046,Paying Attention: Big Data and Social Advertising as Barriers to Ecological Change,"Big data and online media conglomerates have significant power over the behavior of individuals. Online platforms have become the largest canvas for advertising, and the most profitable commodity is users' attention. Large tech companies, such as Facebook and Alphabet, use historically effective psychological advertisement tactics in tandem with enormous amounts of user data to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of their customers, who are not the end-users, but the corporations competing for advertising space on users' screens. This commodification of attention is a serious threat to socio-ecological sustainability. In this paper, I argue that big data and social advertising platforms, such as Facebook, use commodified attention to take advantage of psycho-social neuroticisms and commodity fetishism in modern individuals to perpetuate conspicuous consumption. They also contribute to highly fragmented information ecologies that intentionally obscure scientific facts regarding ecological emergencies. The commitment to stakeholders and growth economics makes social advertising conglomerates a significant barrier to a socio-ecological future. I provide a series of solutions to this problem at the institutional, research, policy, and individual levels and areas for future sustainability research.","Kish, Kaitlin",0,,2006
2047,The Ethical and Academic Implications of the Jeffrey Beall (www.scholarlyoa.com) Blog Shutdown,"A very important event took place on January 15, 2017. On that day, the Jeffrey Beall blog () was silently, and suddenly, shut down by Beall himself. A profoundly divisive and controversial site, the Beall blog represented an existential threat to those journals and publishers that were listed there. On the other hand, the Beall blog was a ray of hope to critics of bad publishing practices that a culture of public shaming was perhaps the only way to rout out those journals-and their editors-and publishers who did not respect basic publishing ethical principles and intrinsic academic values. While members of the former group vilified Beall and his blog, members of the latter camp tried to elevate it to the level of policy. Split by extreme polar forces, for reasons still unknown to the public, Beall deliberately shut down his blog, causing some academic chaos among global scholars, including to the open access movement.","Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.",0,,2007
2048,"Heroism against Death Anxiety and Psychopathology: ""Self-Worth"" as Protective Factor in Outpatient Psychotherapy","Background: The findings of previous studies suggest that death anxiety is an important factor for the development of mental disorders. Especially, terror management theory assumes that human beings use 2 different strategies to prevent death anxiety: (1) they try to increase ""self-worth""; (2) they uphold the values of their culture. Patients and Methods: Within the framework of this prospective study, 56 outpatients under psychotherapy (29 females, age 42.8 years, {SD} 13.8), mainly with depressive disorders, were investigated by interviews/surveys concerning death anxiety ({BOFRETTA}) as well as religiosity, among other things. Results: Death anxiety was significantly correlated with the severity of psychic symptomatology ({BDI}), neuroticism ({NEO}-{FFI}), and upholding of cultural values ({LeBe}). As expected, there was a significant negative relationship between self-worth and death anxiety. This was not observed regarding other parameters, such as sense of life, religiosity, and spirituality. Discussion and Conclusions: Death anxiety seems to play an important role in the development and continuation of mental problems. An important protective factor seems to be self-worth. It is assumed that upholding of cultural values is an unconscious attempt to reduce death anxiety and mental symptomatology; however, this is not effective. (c) 2019 S.

2049,A snake who eats the devil's tail: The recursivity of good and evil in the security state,"The Islamic State and Mexican drug 'cartels' have been positioned as extreme menaces to the Western world by media and state actors despite their inability to pose existential threats to the {US}. These groups deftly facilitate such representations through barbaric violence which security and information sharing apparatuses uptake and amplify. The 'good' neoliberal security state combats and inflates these 'evil' threats which, in turn, empowers purveyors of security in a deregulated environment. The authors interrogate this problem through the lens of negative utopias presented in speculative fiction to understand the implications for state and society. Projected representations of evil as an existential threat present a conflicted vision of the future manipulated by political and media actors with dire consequences for democratic ideals. National security relies on a never-ending cast of foreign threats that legitimize counter-terror actions in the name of moral good. Security institutions persist primarily through the simultaneous representation of a never-ending battle of good and evil. They stand to gain from the existence of extremely violent groups, without legitimate progress towards their eradication. They also bring fantasy into reality through the recursive enactment of good versus evil.","Baker, Natalie D. and Jones, Nathan",0,,2009
2050,Vocational Melancholy,"This essay explores the affects that circulate in and around libraries from a perspective informed by feminist cultural studies and Black feminist theory. I situate the library as an institution devoted to the cultivation of sentiment and the creation of virtual publics. Though flush with the promises of freedom and equality, this legacy remains fraught with contradiction: for those promises are implicated in the oppressive structures of capitalism and patriarchal white supremacy. And new rationalizations of old forms of state-sanctioned violence and neglect, though targeted specifically at the most vulnerable, constitute an existential threat to us all. Yet the proper subject of such promises-the liberal subject of racialized and gendered privilege-has failed, again and again, to imagine how the world might turn out otherwise than this. In the hopes of practicing forms of accountability to the wisdom of others, I situate myself, as a beneficiary of structural oppression, vis-a-vis the melancholy that troubles the profession of liberal (or library) sentiments with what haunts the present and threatens the future.","Smith, Dolsy",0,,2010
2051,"The experiences of adult heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation recipients: A systematic review of qualitative research evidence","Aim To review evidence about the experience of being the recipient of a donated heart, lungs, or heart and lungs. Design A systematic review (registered with {PROSPERO}: {CRD}42017067218), in accordance with {PRISMA} guidelines. Data sources Seven databases and Google Scholar were searched in May 2017 and July 2019 for papers reporting English-language research that had used qualitative methods to investigate experiences of adult recipients. Review methods Quality was assessed and results were analysed thematically. Results 24 papers (reporting 20 studies) were eligible and included. Their results were organised into three chronological periods: pre-transplant (encompassing the themes of 'dynamic psychosocial impact', 'resources and support'), transplant ('The Call', 'intensive care unit'), and post-transplant ('dynamic psychosocial impact', 'management', 'rejection'). Sub-themes were also identified. It was evident that contemplating and accepting listing for transplantation entailed or amplified realisation of the precipitating illness's existential threat. The period surrounding transplantation surgery was marked by profound, often surreal, experiences. Thereafter, although life usually improved, it incorporated unforeseen challenges. The transplantation clinic remained important to the recipient. The meaning of the clinic and its staff could be both reassuring (providing care and support) and threatening (representing onerous medical requirements and potential organ rejection). Conclusion This review has implications for the psychosocial care of transplant recipients and indicates the need for further research to gain insight into the experience of receiving a donated heart and/or lung. Impact Medical consequences of heart and lung transplantation are well documented; this is the first systematic review of research using qualitative methods to investigate the experience of heart, lung, and heart-and-lung transplantation. The psychosocial impact of transplantation was found to be dynamic and complex, with notable features evident before, during, and after transplantation. Clinic staff remained significant to recipients. It is clear that recipients need continuing psychosocial as well as medical support.","Stubber, Claire and Kirkman, Maggie",0,,2011
2052,A review and integrated theoretical model of the development of body image and eating disorders among midlife and aging men,"Etiological models of the development of eating disorders among midlife and aging men are lacking. The present study provides a review and integration of existing theoretical frameworks and empirical data relevant to the examination of eating pathology in this population and introduces an integrated model of risk and protective factors for the development of eating disorder symptoms. Several etiological models of eating pathology that have gained some empirical support, or present relevance to this population, are briefly reviewed including sociocultural theory, objectification theory, social identity theory, positive body image and the developmental theory of embodiment, and existential and terror management theory, and finally biologically based theories. In addition, these frameworks were extended to account for developmental and gender-specific factors that may influence the development of eating disorders. An integrated model of risk and protective factors that brings together critical elements of these extended theoretical frameworks is presented, with the goal of guiding and stimulating research in this neglected group.","Matsumoto, Atsushi and Rodgers, Rachel F.",0,,2012
2053,Death-related distress in adult primary brain tumor patients,"Background: A diagnosis of cancer may increase mortality salience and provoke death-related distress. Primary brain tumor ({PBT}) patients may be at particular risk for such distress given the certainty of tumor progression, lack of curative treatments, and poor survival rates. This study is the first to examine the prevalence of death-related distress and its correlates in {PBT} patients. Methods: Adult {PBT} patients (N=105) enrolled in this cross-sectional study and completed the Death Distress Scale (subscales: Death Depression, Death Anxiety, Death Obsession), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Prevalence and predictors of death-related distress, and the relationships of demographic variables to clusters of distress, were explored. Results: The majority of {PBT} patients endorsed clinically significant death-related distress in at least one domain. Death anxiety was endorsed by 81\%, death depression by 12.5\%, and death obsession by 10.5\%. Generalized anxiety was the only factor associated with global death-related distress. Cluster analysis yielded 4 profiles: global distress, emotional distress, resilience, and existential distress. Participants in the resilience cluster were significantly further out from diagnosis than those in the existential distress cluster. There were no differences in cluster membership based on age, sex, or tumor grade. Conclusions: {PBT} patients appear to have a high prevalence of death-related distress, particularly death anxiety. Further, 4 distinct profiles of distress were identified, supporting the need for tailored approaches to addressing death-related distress. A shift in clusters of distress based on time since diagnosis also suggest the need for future longitudinal assessment.","Loughan, Ashlee R. and Aslanzadeh, Farah J. and Brechbiel, Julia and Rodin, Gary and Husain, Mariya and Braun, Sarah E. and Willis, Kelcie D. and Lanoye, Autumn",0,,2013
2054,"Thinking about My Existence during {COVID}-19, I Feel Anxiety and Awe-The Mediating Role of Existential Anxiety and Life Satisfaction on the Relationship between {PTSD} Symptoms and Post-Traumatic Growth","Background: The global outbreak of {COVID}-19set new challenges and threats for every human being. In the psychological field it is similar to deep existential crises or a traumatic experience that may lead to the appearance or exacerbation of a serious mental disorder and loss of life meaning and satisfaction. Courtney et al. (2020) discussed deadly pandemic {COVID}-19 in the light of {TMT} theory and named it as global contagion of mortality that personally affected every human being. Such unique conditions activate existential fears as people start to be aware of their own mortality. Objective: The main aim of this study was to test the mediating effect of existential anxiety, activated by {COVID}-19 and life satisfaction ({SWLS}) on the relationship between {PTSD} symptoms and post-traumatic growth ({PTG}). We also examined the moderated mediating effect of severity of trauma symptoms on life satisfaction and existential anxiety and its associations with {PTG}. Method: We conducted an online survey during the peak of the {COVID}-19 outbreak in Poland. The participants completed existential anxiety scale ({SNE}), life satisfaction scale ({SWLS}), {IES}-R scale for measuring the level of {PTSD} symptoms and post-traumatic growth inventory ({PTGI}). Results: The effect of {PTSD} on {PTG} was found to be mediated by existential anxiety and life satisfaction. We also confirmed two indirect effects: (1) the indirect effect of {PTSD} on {PTG} via existential anxiety and life satisfaction tested simultaneously; (2) the indirect effect of life satisfaction on {PTG} through severity of trauma symptoms. An intermediate or high level of {PTSD} level was related to less {PTG} when low and full {PTSD} stress symptoms strengthened {PTG} experiences. Conclusions: A therapeutic intervention for individuals after traumatic experience should attempt to include fundamental existential questions and meaning of life as well as the severity of {PTSD} symptoms. The severity of traumatic sensations may affect the relationship between life satisfaction and post-traumatic growth.","Tomaszek, Katarzyna and Muchacka-Cymerman, Agnieszka",0,,2014
2055,"Disparate on-site access to water, sanitation, and food storage heighten the risk of {COVID}-19 spread in Sub-Saharan Africa","{COVID}-19 is an active pandemic that likely poses an existential threat to humanity. Frequent handwashing, social distancing, and partial or total lockdowns are among the suite of measures prescribed by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) and being implemented across the world to contain the pandemic. However, existing inequalities in access to certain basic necessities of life (water, sanitation facility, and food storage) create layered vulnerabilities to {COVID}-19 and can render the preventive measures ineffective or simply counterproductive. We hypothesized that individuals in households without any of the named basic necessities of life are more likely to violate the preventive (especially lockdown) measures and thereby increase the risk of infection or aid the spread of {COVID}-19. Based on nationally-representative data for 25 sub-Saharan African ({SSA}) countries, multivariate statistical and geospatial analyses were used to investigate whether, and to what extent, household family structure is associated with in-house access to basic needs which, in turn, could reflect on a higher risk of {COVID}-19 infection. The results indicate that approximately 46\% of the sampled households in these countries (except South Africa) did not have in-house access to any of the three basic needs and about 8\% had access to all the three basic needs. Five countries had less than 2\% of their households with in-house access to all three basic needs. Ten countries had over 50\% of their households with no in-house access to all the three basic needs. There is a social gradient in in-house access between the rich and the poor, urban and rural richest, male- and female-headed households, among others. We conclude that {SSA} governments would need to infuse innovative gender- and age-sensitive support services (such as water supply, portable sanitation) to augment the preventive measures prescribed by the {WHO}. Short-, medium- and long-term interventions within and across countries should necessarily address the upstream, midstream and downstream determinants of in-house access and the full spectrum of layers of inequalities including individual, interpersonal, institutional, and population levels.","Ekumah, Bernard and Armah, Frederick Ato and Yawson, David Oscar and Quansah, Reginald and Nyieku, Florence Esi and Owusu, Samuel Asiedu and Odoi, Justice Odoiquaye and Afitiri, Abdul-Rahaman",0,,2015

2057,Is Nationalism Rising in Times of the {COVID}-19 Pandemic? Individual-Level Evidence from the United States,"Following the advent of the {COVID}-19 pandemic, analysts have noted a global rise of nationalism as countries have engaged in a number of nationalist moves in response to the pandemic. However, the implication of policy changes at the individual-level remains unclear: do citizens support those nationalist government responses? More importantly, do people tend to be more nationalistic following the outbreak? Building on terror management theory ({TMT}), this article examines whether and how ideological beliefs affect individuals' support for nationalist policies during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. According to {TMT}, to cope with death anxiety, people are predisposed to ideological defense, resulting in cohesion with individuals who validate their beliefs and hostility toward those who threaten them. Thus, we argue that when states' nationalist policies are aligned with their ideology, people tend to support them; yet, when states' nationalist policies contradict their ideology, people tend to withdraw their support. Specifically, this study found that as non-conservatives (compared to conservatives) are more concerned with the virus, they are more likely to show an inclination of ideological validation. Given that their ideology advocates more tolerance, non-conservatives are less likely to support nationalistic policies. To test the hypotheses, we applied structural equation modeling to a March 2020 {CNN} Poll (nationally representative {US} data about {COVID}-19). The statistical analysis demonstrated strong support for our arguments.","Su, Ruolin and Shen, Wensong",0,,2017
2058,The Relationship between Political Ideology and the Pursuit of Staying Forever Young,"In an era defined by an aging population, the desire to look younger is so great, that the anti-aging industry is expected to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars within only a few years' time. This research aims to investigate how the increasing interest to look younger is related to political ideology. We propose that accepting the ideal beauty of youthful bodies and pursuing physical youthfulness would be more prevalent among conservatives. We build this upon previous research showing that political conservatism is related to the acceptance of norms and values, as well as having strict boundaries for social perceptions and sensitivity to threat and losses. We conducted a pilot study which revealed that the queries related to anti-aging were more popular in states where political conservatism was higher in the {US}. Moreover, a survey among American participants revealed that conservatives tended to show a greater interest in preserving their youthfulness, and that they had more resistant attitudes toward aging. Moreover, they exhibited higher preferences for anti-aging benefits, compared to liberals and moderates. These findings contribute to extant literature on political psychology, body ideal, and ageism by demonstrating the relationship between political ideology and the pursuit of youthfulness, which is a neglected but critical dimension of the beauty ideal.","Oh, Ga-Eun",0,,2018
2059,Development and initial psychometric properties of a panic buying scale during {COVID}-19 pandemic,"Fear is a powerful driver of human behavior, even more during times of crisis. Panic buying occurs when fear and panic influence behavior leading people to buy more things than usual. So far, no specific scale on this has been found in the major databases, thus the aim of this exploratory study is to develop a Panic Buying Scale ({PBS}) during {COVID}-19 pandemic. 393 Brazilians took part in this study (251 women and 142 men), answering a sociodemographic questionnaire and instruments of these variables: (1)panic buying, (2)impulse buying, (3) temporal focus, (4)optimism, (5)risk perception, (6)need for cognition. Data collection was conducted through an online questionnaire which was shared through social media networks, from April 10th to May 4th, 2020. Factorial exploratory and confirmatory analysis indicated that {PBS} has a unidimensional solution and showed satisfactory reliability indexes. Results revealed that men buy more by panic than women. {PBS} also was positively correlated with impulse buying, past and future temporal focus, and risk perception; as well as negatively correlated with optimism and age. Findings suggest that {PBS} is psychometrically acceptable in the Brazilian context. This new instrument can be useful to understand the psychosocial phenomena associated with consumer behavior.

2060,Driving forces of green consumption in sharing economy,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the accelerators of sharing economy that lead to sustainability by adopting green consumption. Nostalgia is studied as a mediator along with social connectedness and past orientation. Specifically, the study is based upon a framework to explore the outcomes of sharing economy through an individual's green consumption behavior from the perspective of mortality anxiety. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative research technique was employed by collecting data from 537 households through snowball sampling. The model was tested using partial least squares ({SEM}-{VB}). The validity of the theoretical and measurement model was assessed. Findings The results revealed that nostalgia positively influences social connectedness and past orientation, whereas social connectedness and past orientation accelerate green consumption. However, it was confirmed that nostalgia decreases green consumption. Research limitations/implications The drivers of sharing economy lead toward environmentally friendly consumer behavior by providing opportunities for different agents to increase the usage of shared consumption. The model can be improved by introducing other mediating variables to enrich understanding. Practical implications The study may provide opportunities for practitioners and the government to identify the key factors in a sharing economy, specifically with reference to green consumption and social connectedness. It is predicted that it will help reduce environmental deterioration. Originality/value This study identifies the role of mortality anxiety and nostalgia toward green consumption, predominantly in the context of a sharing economy. It is a forward to collaborative consumption.","Khan, Ruqia and Awan, Tahir Mumtaz and Fatima, Tayyba and Javed, Maria",0,,2020

2062,Death Anxiety in Patients With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With and Without Brain Metastases,"Context. Death anxiety is common in patients with metastatic cancer, but its relationship to brain metastases and cognitive decline is unknown. Early identification of death anxiety and its determinants allows proactive interventions to be offered to those in need. Objectives. To identify psychological, physical, and disease-related (including brain metastases and cognitive impairment) factors associated with death anxiety in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ({mNSCLC}) patients. Methods. A cross-sectional pilot study with {mNSCLC} outpatients completing standardized neuropsychological tests and validated questionnaires measuring death anxiety, cognitive concerns, illness intrusiveness, depression, demoralization, self-esteem, and common cancer symptoms. We constructed a composite for objective cognitive function (mean neuropsychological tests z-scores). Results. Study measures were completed by 78 patients (50\% females; median age 62 years [range 37-82]). Median time since {mNSCLC} diagnosis was 11 months (range 0-89); 53\% had brain metastases. At least moderate death anxiety was reported by 43\% (n = 33). Objective cognitive impairment was present in 41\% (n = 32) and perceived cognitive impairment in 27\% (n = 21). Death anxiety, objective, and perceived cognitive impairment did not significantly differ between patients with and without brain metastases. In univariate analysis, death anxiety was associated with demoralization, depression, self-esteem, illness intrusiveness, common physical cancer symptoms, and perceived cognitive impairment. In multivariate analysis, demoralization (P {\textless} 0.001) and illness intrusiveness (P = 0.001) were associated with death anxiety. Conclusion. Death anxiety and brain metastases are common in patients with {mNSCLC} but not necessarily linked. The association of death anxiety with both demoralization and illness intrusiveness highlights the importance of integrated psychological and symptom management. Further research is needed on the psychological impact of brain metastases. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

What bigger existential threat is there than climate change? Design/methodology/approach Personal viewpoint from general research. Findings Three pillars of likely government and legislative interventions are identified; namely, increased and enhanced energy regulation and carbon pricing to force a rapid switch to green energy sources for buildings; an enhanced role for Energy Performance Certificates, standardised methodologies and strict enforcement; and mandatory reporting of financial and physical climate risks based on the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

2064,Timing of descriptions shapes experience-based risky choice,"Risky decisions based on the combination of different sources of information (e.g., decisions from description-plus-experience) have mostly been ignored, as research has focused on examining each source separately. Across three experiments, we explore the intricate relationship between experience and description by manipulating when descriptive information about risky options is made available during an experience-based task. The results show that the amount of prior experience moderates the way that descriptive information is considered and integrated in the decision-making process: Descriptions affected behavior more when participants had little experience with the task, whereas their effect was less pronounced with extended experience. This relationship reversed when participants had access to foregone payoffs, with descriptions being considered more when participants had more time to interact with the task. Potential mechanisms and theoretical accounts are discussed with an emphasis on how the results and conclusions of the present work can be applied to the effective design of warning labels.","Weiss-Cohen, Leonardo and Konstantinidis, Emmanouil and Harvey, Nigel",0,,2024
2065,"Personality, meaning of life and fear of death in affective disorders Pilot study with outpatient psychotherapy patients","Background The results of the few studies carried out so far suggest that fear of death is an important causal and maintaining variable in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. In this connection the importance of personality as well as life-fulfilling and crisis-preventing behavior are not completely understood. Material and methods This explorative study included 54 patients from a psychotherapy outpatient clinic (27 women and 27 men, mean age 43.7 years, standard deviation, {SD} +/- 13.2 years). More than 90\% of the participants had a psychiatric disorder with an F3 and F4 classification according to {ICD}-10. Participants were investigated by semistructured interviews and questionnaires, e.g. fear of death (Bochum questionnaire for collation of fear of death and attitudes towards death, {BOFRETTA}), personality dimensions ({NEO}-five factors inventory, {NEO}-{FFI}) and meaning of life ({LeBe}). Results Significant correlation coefficients with the three {BOFRETTA} scale values were found only for the personality dimension neuroticism (according to {NEO}-{FFI}), where an enhanced neuroticism grade was correlated to a higher {BOFRETTA} sum value (r= 0.496; p{\textless} 0.000), to a higher value concerning fear of death (r= 0.524; p{\textless} 0.000) and to a negative attitude towards death (r= 0.401; p= 0.003). Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between fear of death and crises in the meaning of life (r= 0.284; p= 0.038). Finally, significant relationships were found between the {LeBe} dimension of order and {BOFRETTA} values (fear: r= 0.458; p{\textless} 0.000; attitude: r= 0.521; p{\textless} 0.000; total: r= 0.504; p{\textless} 0.000). For these relationships there were also significant differences with respect to gender. Conclusion Neuroticism, crisis of life in the context of a psychiatric disorder as well as sex-specific differently weighted meaning of life have an impact on fear of death and are associated with a problematic attitude towards death. A stronger consideration of these relationships within the framework of an individually adapted psychiatric psychotherapeutic treatment of each patient is desirable.","Mavrogiorgou, Paraskevi and Chmielewski, Fabian and Harming, Sven and Juckel, Georg",0,,2025
2066,Fear of terror and employees' behaviour in terrorist-ridden areas,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the impact of fear of terror ({FOT}) on employee organizational commitment ({OC}) working in terror-induced areas through examining the role of rumination as a mediator and perceived organization support ({POS}) as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a model in which the mediating role of rumination in the {FOT} relationship is conditional to the values of {OC}. Using a sample size of 268 respondents, questionnaires were used to collect data from Pakistan during a period when terrorist attacks were at a peak. Results from the hierarchical regression analyses provided support for the developed model. Findings Overall, the statistical model is significant (p {\textless} 0.05); the authors found negative relationships between {FOT} and {OC}. The authors found that {FOT} positively led to rumination, which then negatively led to {OC}. It was also found that {POS} significantly moderated {FOT} and {OC}. Practical implications This study revealed that {FOT} is a deterring factor that changed employees' {OC}. It further revealed that organizations providing support to employees working in terrorist-ridden areas showed positive commitment. This paper discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. Originality/value This paper provides an examination of the relationship between {FOT} and employee {OC}. It expands our knowledge of the stress theory and terror management theory for employees working in discontinuous areas.","Soomro, Shuaib Ahmed and Roques, Olivier and Ali, Akhtiar",0,,2026
2067,Thinking educational controversies through evil and prophetic indictment: Conversation versus conversion,"This article is about evil and its function in educational discourse. The research posits, using work in postsecularism and particularly through an historical, legal, and theological read of prophetic indictment and the function of the jeremiad in educational policy, that the terms of educational debate are rendered in a legal rather than a deliberative discursive framework. This lends itself, then, to the creation of evil others opposed to one's own preferred policy prescriptions and renders much of the discussion about and around the need for conversation and comity moot. The authors propose attending to the function of evil in education as well as positing an historical approach to thinking about why we often can't think differently about educational arguments.","Burke, Kevin J. and van Kessel, Cathryn",0,,2027
2068,Will Buying Follow Others Ease Their Threat of Death? An Analysis of Consumer Data during the Period of {COVID}-19 in China,"How to overcome informational conformity consumer behavior when faced with threats of death is a social problem in response to {COVID}-19. This research is based on the terror management theory, the need to belong theory and the materialism theory. It uses a theoretical model to determine the relationships between threats of death and informational conformity consumer behavior. From 1453 samples collected during outbreak of {COVID}-19 in China, we used a structural equation model to test multiple research hypotheses. The result shows that threats of death are positively associated with a need to belong, materialism and informational conformity consumer behavior. The need to belong and materialism can play a mediating role between threats of death and information conformity consumption behavior, and perceived social support can play a moderating role between threats of death and information conformity consumption behavior.","Song, Wei and Jin, Xiaotong and Gao, Jian and Zhao, Taiyang",1,,2028
2069,{ASSURING} A {FREE} {AND} {OPEN} {INDO}-{PACIFIC} - {REBALANCING} {THE} {US} {APPROACH},"Borrowing the term 'Indo-Pacific' from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and refashioning the Obama 'Pivot to Asia' or 'Rebalance Strategy', the Trump administration has articulated a vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific ({FOIP}), which, as its public discourse and official documents reveal, is defined through the lens of great power competition with China. Since the latter part of 2017, the administration has laid the groundwork for a whole-of-government approach aimed at advancing this vision, which consists of three pillars: economy, governance, and security. Southeast Asia - a dynamic sub-region and the fulcrum of the wider Indo-Pacific - is central to the evolving {US} strategy. However, in its current form, that strategy casts China in the role of an existential threat and economic enemy, and seems overly focused on military security. For these reasons, it is unlikely to garner the full support of allies and partners - without which shared prosperity, good governance, and a peaceful and secure regional order across the Indo-Pacific cannot be assured. A repositioning and repurposing of the recently resuscitated Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad) could transform this minilateral platform into a useful instrument to coordinate the four members' actions, leverage the capabilities of Quad-Plus countries, and engage {ASEAN} in managing non-traditional security challenges and furthering its connectivity agenda.","Calabrese, John",0,,2029
2070,Mortality Salience and Mobile Voice Calling: A Case of a Massive Natural Disaster,"Observational studies have found that the frequency of mobile communication with close ties increases in times of emergency. However, the mechanisms underlying such increases are not well understood. Drawing upon terror management theory, this study predicted that increased mortality salience due to disaster promotes mobile voice calling to close ties. By analyzing digitally traced behavioral data, Study 1 found that mobile voice calls to close ties increased after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, especially in areas where there were severe tremors. Study 2 employed a field experiment and demonstrated that psychologically priming respondents to recall the earthquake led to an increase in the number of outgoing mobile voice calls to close ties, but not to non-close ties. The theoretical implications for mobile communication in time of disaster are discussed.","Suzuki, Takahisa and Kobayashi, Tetsuro and Boase, Jeffrey and Tanaka, Yuko and Wakimoto, Ryutaro and Suzuki, Tsutomu",0,,2030
2071,"When thinking of my death leads to thinking of others' deaths: the effect of collectivism, psychological closeness, and mortality salience on prosocial behavioral intentions in the Sewol ferry disaster","Many South Koreans were traumatized by the 2014 Sewol ferry incident. Focusing on the Sewol ferry incident, this study examined the relationship between collectivism, psychological closeness, and prosocial behavior intentions and further investigated how thoughts about one's own death moderated this association. Using a sample of South Korean adults (N = 310), we conducted an online experiment and generated several important findings: (a) collectivism increased psychological closeness; (b) psychological closeness increased prosocial behavior intentions; (c) collectivism increased prosocial behavior intentions; (d) psychological closeness mediated the relationship between collectivism and prosocial behavior intentions; and (e) the mediation effect of psychological closeness on the relationship between collectivism and prosocial behavior intentions was strong for people who thought about their own deaths. Our research complements the terror management theory ({TMT}) by suggesting that thinking about one's own death can have a beneficial role in eliciting a prosocial behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. This study contributes to building a disaster-related policy and resilient infrastructure in that it helps understanding how collectivistic orientations and psychological closeness toward disasters play roles in disaster preparedness and management.","Lee, Jiyoung and Kim, Yungwook",1,,2031
2072,"'Swamped': the populist construction of fear, crisis and dangerous others in Pauline Hanson's senate speeches","This paper critically examines the discursive construction of fear, crises, threat and dangerous Others in Pauline Hanson's populist political communication from 2016-2018. Specifically, it looks at how a politics of fear manifests through the construction of Islam and Muslims as Others who pose an existential threat to Australia's security and 'culture'. Drawing on critical discourse analysis, this paper examines the way in which discursive strategies and other linguistic devices are used purposefully in order to serve Hanson's right-wing populist agenda. This paper argues that Hanson is emblematic of both liberal and illiberal Islamophobia and that she strategically draws on liberal critiques of Islam to justify draconian policies such as immigration bans and restrictions on religious freedoms. Underpinning this research is the belief that populist communication is consequential and must be examined for a holistic understanding of the populist phenomenon.","Sengul, Kurt",0,,2032
2073,Can employees perform well if they fear for their lives? Yes - if they have a passion for work,"Purpose With a basis in conservation of resources theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of championing behaviour in the relationship between employees' fear of terror and their job performance, as well as the buffering role of their passion for work, as a personal resource, in this process. Design/methodology/approach The tests of the hypotheses rely on three-wave, time-lagged data collected from employees and their supervisors in Pakistan. Findings An important reason that concerns about terrorist attacks diminish performance is that employees refrain from championing their own entrepreneurial ideas. This mediating role of idea championing is less salient, however, to the extent that employees feel a strong passion for their work. Originality/value This study adds to burgeoning research on the interplay between terrorism and organizational life by specifying how and when employees' ruminations about terrorism threats might escalate into diminished performance outcomes at work.","Ul Haq, Inam and De Clercq, Dirk and Azeem, Muhammad Umer",0,,2033
2074,"Gobbledygook: Political Questions, Manageability, \& Partisan Gerrymandering","In finding that extreme partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable political question in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court fixated upon the lack of judicially manageable standards to evaluate their constitutionality. The decision culminated in the Court's recent reinforcement of that manageability focus in partisan gerrymandering cases, with Chief Justice Roberts even calling efforts to numerically calculate the extremity of such gerrymandering ""sociological gobbledygook."" Such belabored fears about manageability misread the questions in the political question doctrine. The doctrine requires the Justices to initially ask, as a normative matter, whether the judiciary should resolve the controversy in our constitutional system, and only then to consider practical manageability concerns. The Court has taken the reverse approach, failing to acknowledge the damage extreme partisan gerrymandering does to our representative democracy of separated powers. The Court has also used an incoherent understanding of manageability that moves the goalposts for those that would measure and control partisan gerrymandering. In turn, the Court has first demanded more precise standards, then required more malleable ones. That impossibly exacting standard for standards is out of step with constitutional jurisprudence of similarly broad impact, such as Second and Fourth Amendment law, reapportionment cases, and racial gerrymandering. The Rucho Court should have tackled the normative question directly, finding that extreme partisan gerrymandering is an existential threat to our tripartite government. It exacerbates legislative gridlock, forcing an overburdened judiciary to act as the primary agent of legal change. The Court should then have relaxed its demands for manageable standards. Manageability is a sliding scale; where an issue is normatively vital to democracy's future, the Justices should experiment with malleable standards. Adjudicating these cases with imperfect standards would have unleashed human capital to help repair the partisan rot in our democracy.","Gentithes, Michael",0,,2034
2075,Imagining the New Socialist Child: The Cultural Afterlife of the Child Martyr Wang Erxiao,"Recent scholarship in modern Chinese studies has established the centrality of the figure of the child in modern configurations of nationhood. Yet very few studies have focused on the motif of child martyrdom and its place within Chinese socialist culture. By exploring the cultural afterlife of the socialist martyr Wang Erxiao in mid-twentieth-century China, this article shows how the heroic sacrificial death of the boy both powered and imperiled the Communist-led revolution and the construction of a new, socialist society. The author argues that, on the one hand, the figure of the socialist child martyr embodied the desire for the child to play a more active role in the Communist revolution and in the creation of a socialist utopia. On the other hand, in lionizing the heroic death of the child-the so-called revolutionary successor-stories like Wang Erxiao's also posed an existential threat to the socialist community and brought to the fore tensions intrinsic to politicizing and aestheticizing the death of a child. By examining the relationship between children, violence, and sacrificial death, this article highlights the desires and anxieties embedded within the socialist project to create an image of the ""new child.""","Kauffman, Andrew",0,,2035
2076,Social curiosity as a way to overcome death anxiety: perspective of terror management theory,"Social curiosity has been found to have great benefits in human life, especially in fostering interpersonal relationships. Nevertheless there is indication of other benefit of social curiosity that have not yet been explored, namely overcoming the anxiety of death. This indication is based on previous research which found a positive relationship between anxiety and social curiosity. In this study, social curiosity is framed as representation of symbolic immortality, which people use to overcome the terror of death. To support this conjecture, two studies were conducted using the Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) framework. Study 1 (N = 352, M age = 19.39) found a positive relationship between death anxiety and social curiosity. In Study 2 (N = 507, M age = 20.68) it was found that intolerance of uncertainty and desire for self-verification mediated the relationship between death anxiety and social curiosity. The results of this study indicate that increasing interest in obtaining information about how other people think, feel, or act is a form of mechanism used by people to control anxiety related to death.","Fitri, Rani Agias and Asih, Sali Rahadi and Takwin, Bagus",1,,2036
2077,Extralegal Agency and the Search for Safety in Northeast Brazil Moving beyond Carceral Logics,"This article - based on fieldwork conducted in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil - examines how those people most affected by carceral expansion pursue safety in an everyday marked by existential threat. Through a focus on a neglected sector of this population, namely adult women, I show how carceral encounters specifically - and informal, illegal and not-yet-(il)legal exchanges more generally - intersect with familial logics and imperatives to engender a capacity for action that I call 'extralegal agency'. Extralegal agency is central to a practice of safety that represents an alternative to the dominant model of carceral security. An extralegal agency approach to analysing interconnected prison/urban fields, which decentres masculinized criminal organizations and resists romanticizing the rule of law, enables a disruption of dominant discourses of and about the carceral state.","Moore, Hollis",0,,2037
2078,Addiction and the self,"Addiction is standardly characterized as a neurobiological disease of compulsion. Against this characterization, I argue that many cases of addiction cannot be explained without recognizing the value of drugs to those who are addicted; and I explore in detail an insufficiently recognized source of value, namely, a sense of self and social identity as an addict. For people who lack a genuine alternative sense of self and social identity, recovery represents an existential threat. Given that an addict identification carries expectations of continued consumption despite negative consequences, there is therefore a parsimonious explanation of why people who identify as addicts continue to use drugs despite these consequences: they self-identify as addicts and that is what addicts are supposed to do. I conclude by considering how it is nonetheless possible to overcome addiction despite this identity, in part by imagining and enacting a new one. Importantly, this possibility requires the availability of social support and material resources that are all too frequently absent in the lives of those who struggle with addiction.","Pickard, Hanna",0,,2038
2079,The revelation of superintelligence,"The idea of superintelligence is a source of mainly philosophical and ethical considerations. Those considerations are rooted in the idea that an entity which is more intelligent than humans, may evolve in some point in the future. For obvious reasons, the superintelligence is considered as a kind of existential threat for humanity. In this essay, we discuss two ideas. One of them is the putative nature of future superintelligence which does not necessary need to be harmful for humanity. Our key idea states that the superintelligence does not need to assess its own survival as the highest value. As a kind of intelligence that is not biological, it is not clear what kind of attitude the superintelligent entity may evolve towards living organisms. Our second idea refers to the possible revelation of superintelligence. We assume that the self-revelation of such entity cannot be random. The metaphor of God as a superintelligence is introduced here as a helpful conceptual tool.","Szocik, Konrad and Tkacz, Bartlomiej and Gulczynski, Patryk",0,,2039
2080,Constructing Buddhists in Sri Lanka and Myanmar: Imaginary of a Historically Victimised Community,"Radicalised Buddhist movements in Sri Lanka and Myanmar have been prominent as drivers of mistrust, tensions and violence directed against Muslim minorities, particularly since the mid-2010s. This article seeks to understand why ordinary monks, who exert tremendous influence in these societies, have developed anti-Muslim sentiments and even endorse radical movements. To do so I analyse the discursive construction of Buddhists as a historically victimised community and of Muslims as the most potent existential threat to that community. The study uses an ""empathetic"" vantage point to analyse the perceptions of Buddhist monks and laity, because resolving their mistrust of Muslims requires a deeper understanding of their fears and grievances. It delineates a narrative in which other religious communities, historically, have encroached on the Buddhist sphere by imposing limits on its rituals and conversion of Buddhists to other faiths, and through the destruction of Buddhist heritage sites. Monks and laity maintain discourses of fear, stemming from a substantive basis of history in which the pre-colonial and colonial experiences, neglect of local economies, invasions, and incursions into the Buddhist community left a collective memory of injury and external persecution. This narrative critically informs the feelings and behaviour of Buddhist monks vis-a-vis Muslims.","Herath, Dhammika",0,,2040
2081,A people that shall dwell alone; is that so? Israel and the minorities alliance,"The state of Israel, and the Zionist movement before it, has always considered itself to be facing an existential threat from hostile surroundings. Hence, seeking alliance with non-Arab nations and ethnic minority groups in the area was seen as a means of confronting this challenge. During the early decades of its existence, the Israeli establishment adopted the concept of the alliance of the periphery and the alliance of minorities developed by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion and his protegee, Reuven Shiloah, the founder of the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad. This research project will demonstrate that, in opposition to apologetic and ideologically-motivated arguments that deny that alliance with minority communities has been a systematic policy, the minorities' alliance has for decades been an important foundation of Israeli strategy vis-a-vis the Arab world. Furthermore, the article will argue and demonstrate that the 'Minorities Alliance' is derived from ideological, historical, and strategic considerations anchored in the very existence of Zionism and Israel. Furthermore, and on the same note, this conception and strategy cannot be disconnected from the self-perception of Zionism, its self-directed reading of Jewish history, and the Zionisation of the milieu.","Hazran, Yusri",0,,2041
2082,"Consumption, motivation and experience in dark tourism: a conceptual and critical analysis","A review of recent relevant literature related to dark tourism indicates that there is a growing academic interest in 'dark tourism consumption', 'dark tourism motivation' and 'dark tourism experience'. Therefore, the objectives of the present research are threefold: to examine the progress of research on these three concepts; to give a critical analysis of recent research; and to identify research gaps and questions that require fuller examination. In order to adopt new research orientations, the use of a broader post-disciplinary research framework is in need. The findings reveal that the three concepts are evolving and advancing, and new researches push the boundaries of exploration into new directions. From the analysis of recent literature, it can be concluded that thanatopsis is a rare characteristic of tourist visits. This is in contrast to the early conceptual studies, which claim that death is the primary motive for visiting dark sites. The findings reveal that many visitors are motivated by the desire and an interest in cultural heritage, learning, education, understanding about what happened at the dark site etc. It is important to emphasise that these motivations are affected by internal conflicts that the experience generates. Tourist experience is more in line with that of a mainstream heritage sites. In general, if tourists do not experience a site as dark, then they cannot be called dark tourists. Hence, the present research appeals to a clearer distinction of the 'dark tourists' based on experience. Except for the 'mortality mediation model', 'dystopian dark tourism' and 'Terror Management Theory', there are limit efforts to understand tourists at dark sites. Therefore, scientists must propose new approaches and additional empirical researches to prove that interest in death is a key motive for visiting dark sites. Lastly, from the literature review, new directions for further research have emerged.","Iliev, Dejan",0,,2042
2083,"Deviance due to fear of victimization: ""emotional intelligence"" a game-changer","Purpose With a foundation in the conservation of resource theory, this paper aims to examine the validity of a conceptual model that explains the mechanism connecting perceived threat of terrorism to production deviance. The link between perceived threat of terrorism and production deviance was examined via emotional exhaustion. Notably, the study evaluated whether the relationship between perceived threat of terrorism and production deviance is mediated by emotional exhaustion and moderated by levels of emotional intelligence. Design/methodology/approach The study is cross-sectional in nature and data were collected from 432 pharmaceutical sales representatives who operate outdoors in the high-risk region. Two-step approach consisting confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling was used for analysis. To examine conditional direct and indirect effects, the authors used model 8 in {PROCESS}. Findings Results were consistent with prediction made from the conceptual model in that emotional exhaustion partially mediated the relationship between perceived threat of terrorism and production deviance. This was particularly the case when emotional intelligence was low, but not when high. Likewise, perceived threat of terrorism exerted a direct effect on production deviance when emotional intelligence was low, but not when high. Originality/value The study is the first to examine the relationship between perceived threat of terrorism and production deviance. Moreover, no study to date has examined the mediating role of emotional exhaustion between perceived threat of terrorism and production deviance. Finally, up till now, it is unknown that emotional intelligence moderates the relationship of perceived threat of terrorism with emotional exhaustion and production deviance.","Shah, Syed Jamal and Shah, Syed Asad Ali and Ullah, Rizwan and Shah, Adnan Muhammad",0,,2043

However, this article contends that the organised repression against the Shiites movement may push the group into violent extremism as a survival strategy.","Uche, Chidiebube Jasper",0,,2044
2085,Slovakia as a Safe Country - The Perspective of the Slovak Community Members of Vojvodina,"This article explores the current migration of the Slovak community members of Serbia to Slovakia, focusing on their perception of safety and risk, in the period since 1990 when the post-Communist transition began both in Serbia and Slovakia. The authors attempt to analyse how the members of the given community, who migrated to Slovakia during the reference period, perceive Slovakia today from the point of view of their safety, understood as the search for freedom from threats. They focus on individual safety factors (life, health, status, wealth and freedom). After 1990, Slovakia became not only a country left by migrants, but also a country of destination for migrants. One such migrant group is the members of Slovak communities abroad, in particular Serbia, Romania and Ukraine. The first wave of migration of Slovaks from Serbia took place in the early 1990s in connection with the violent ethnic conflicts in former Yugoslavia, and the next one as a result of the global financial crisis in 2008, which intensified after 2015. The main push factors of the migration of Vojvodina Slovaks to Slovakia in the 1990s included attempts to avoid mobilisation and participation in combat operations; after 2008, the key role was played primarily by material issues which they perceived as an existential threat to themselves and to their families. The main pull factor in favour of choosing Slovakia comprise of the relatively small administrative barriers and linguistic proximity. While our interlocutors regarded their concerns about the impacts of the 1990s war conflicts as short-term threats, they perceived the social impacts of the economic transition and uncontrolled global financial crisis after 2008 as long-term or even permanent threats. In this context, they consider Slovakia a safe country. The article is based on extensive multi-sited fieldwork - in-depth interviews with the members of the community and on other available sources (legal documents, statistical data, media, etc.).","Marusiak, Juraj and Zlatanovic, Sanja",0,,2045
2086,The Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation: An Assessment of Its First Dozen Years,"The Special Rapporteur for Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation is a norm entrepreneur, both as a norm monitor and clarifier, as well as an advocate for reparative action for victims. Two incumbents have identified fundamental principles of these two human rights and many implementation requirements for their protection. Appropriate attention has been placed on various vulnerable groups that require greater efforts at norm compliance through policy responses. However, many countries have tremendous inequalities in access to water and sanitation, which are largely unacknowledged and even unnoticed, for which states have a positive responsibility, but which are not easily noticed because of weak civil society monitoring. Both mandate holders have much of their efforts on country visits with governments interested in improvement-which is desirable for both the countries concerned and for the development of rubrics for institutionalized lessons learned, best practices and methodologies for information collection and analysis. Considerable efforts have also been made on norm development that hopefully encourages emulation. More emphasis is needed to identify and clarify legally-binding, hard law requirements in implementation, not just soft-law non-legally binding recommendations to governments and their public and private partners, as well as specifying the binding rights of the vulnerable. Also needed are more cataloguing of government violations of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, especially outside of Latin America, from where the two mandate holders come. Particular attention should be paid to countries that refuse country visits. Greater use of reliable information concerning pollution of drinking water, poor sanitation, economic development without consultation or impact analysis, exorbitant pricing of water, and inadequate sanitation that allows public defecation. This office should also coordinate generally more often with other Special Procedures on many inter-sectional issues, but above all else, on climate change issues, which present an existential threat to rights protection. While there are many competing claims for resources, important issues regarding access to safe drinking water and sanitation go unnoticed by this office because of its insufficient attention to early warning and urgent action procedures for these violations. However, the contributions of the two mandate holders to norm development has been clear, effective and deserving of praise.","Carey, Henry F.",0,,2046
2087,Pressure drop: Securitising and de-securitising safeguarding,"{INTRODUCTION}: This article explores how securitisation theory is mobilised in contemporary social work discourse, policy and practice. We draw on recent child protection research to support our claim that a new practice issue, described previously as securitised safeguarding, has emerged. {APPROACH}: We demonstrate its emergence using securitisation theory as a conceptual mode of analysis to describe how a securitised safeguarding response depicts particular families as an existential threat which, in turn, prompts a response characterised by forms of muscular liberalism. {CONCLUSIONS}: We argue that this emerging practice issue requires critical consideration and suggest it will have a significant impact on social work - one that is unlikely to be beneficial for the profession and, more importantly, families being worked with. By describing a process of de-securitisation, we offer an alternative and more nuanced approach that perceives families holistically, and mobilises a welfare safeguarding model. This more closely resembles traditional social work values of emancipation, liberation and empowerment within social work practice.","{McKendrick}, David and Finch, Jo",0,,2047
2088,"From {CNOOC} to Huawei: securitization, the China threat, and critical infrastructure","This article uses critical discourse analysis to examine how China has been constructed as an existential threat by the United States. Specifically, it explores how {US} reactions to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation ({CNOOC}) in 2005 created precedent for similar reactions to Huawei a decade later. It uses these case studies to demonstrate how the interplay between the China threat and security discourses of critical infrastructure has worked to successfully securitize China within broader American discourse. These examinations demonstrate a deliberate and protracted securitization of China by {US} elites, and they support more critical approaches to securitization theory that emphasize cumulative and incremental aspects over a securitized/desecuritized binary. Discourse analysis of key texts allows the reader to uncover how security issues are socially constructed, and discursive examinations of {CNOOC} and Huawei illustrate how concerns about national security are now employed in everyday American political discourse so that the China Threat Discourse has become the primary reading of China by {US} observers.","Campion, Andrew Stephen",0,,2048
2089,"An assessment of violent imagery in advertisements on city buses in Manhattan, New York City","Background: Violence or violent imagery, defined as any image that conveys an imminent physical or existential threat to person(s), property, or society, with or without weaponry, is often featured in advertising. However, the effects of exposure (sporadic or chronic) to such imagery are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence and types of violence portrayed in advertising on public buses in New York City ({NYC}). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, from April to July 2019, researchers catalogued and coded the print advertising images present on the passenger entry side of all Metropolitan Transit Authority ({MTA}) bus lines in Manhattan to determine whether images of violence or violent acts were present. Unlike images of alcohol and tobacco products (banned from {MTA} property in 2017 and 1992, respectively), there are no similar restrictions on violence or violent imagery. Results: A total of 23 out of 136 (17\%) observed advertisements included images of violence and/or actual or imminent violent acts. One hundred percent of images involving violence were embedded in advertisements for mass media/entertainment purposes often featuring wellknown and favorably regarded actors and entertainment personalities or companies. Conclusion: People of all ages and backgrounds are passively exposed to bus advertisements in a variety of settings. This study contributes to the literature regarding the extent to which the public is passively exposed to violent advertising. Additional study is required to further understand the link between violent imagery and attitudes toward/tolerance of violence.","Basch, Corey H. and Mohlman, Jan and Basch, Charles E.",0,,2049
2090,Self-affirmation effects on doping related cognition among exercisers who use nutritional supplements,"Objectives: The use of nutritional supplements has been associated with stronger doping intentions and actual use of doping substances, but there is limited research about doping risk communication among nutritional supplement users. The present study examined if using a self-affirmation manipulation a) changes intentions to use doping and b) influences related social cognitions (i.e., attitudes, social and moral norms, self-efficacy and situational temptation, and anticipated regret) among exercisers who use nutritional supplements, following a brief exposure to doping-related health risk messages. Design: Between subjects experimental design. Method: Sixty exercisers were randomly assigned to self-affirmation and control groups and completed a structured and anonymous questionnaire about doping intentions and related social cognitive variables. Results: Self-affirmed participants reported higher scores in descriptive and moral norms and anticipated regret towards using doping substances, than control participants. Doping intentions were predicted by situational temptation and anticipated regret. Anticipated regret mediated the effect of the self-affirmation manipulation on doping intentions. Conclusions: In the context of doping risk communication, self-affirmation may influence the decision-making process by acting on anticipated regret. Our findings can inform risk communication campaigns targeting exercisers who use nutritional supplements.","Barkoukis, Vassilis and Rowe, Richard and Harris, Peter R. and Lazuras, Lambros",0,,2050
2091,"Backlash, Intersectionality, and Trumpism","Many feminists theorize backlash as reactionary opposition to progressive gains by those seeking to reestablish the status quo. This essay extends this theorization by raising and answering two related questions: where does backlash come from, and what does backlash do? I argue that backlash emerges from the resurgence of questions regarding who belongs in the polity and that these questions about proper membership are reflected in contemporary conservative discourse that casts certain groups, such as migrants, Muslims, and women-especially transgender women-as outsiders. Backlash thus functions at the level of physical violence as well as existential threat. I illustrate these arguments by focusing on two cases: a personal narrative of backlash I experienced shortly after the 2016 election and an intersectional analysis of rhetoric used by conservative commentator Milo Yiannopolous in two televised appearances that took place in 2017.","Murib, Zein",0,,2051
2092,"Re-Thinking the ""Problem"" in Inquiry-Based Pedagogies through Exemplarity and World-Oriented","This paper conducts a theoretical exploration of the inquiry-problem in problem-oriented pedagogies. Specifically, the article draws on a critical reflection of the addition of a global and internationalisation dimension to the problem-oriented project learning ({PPL}) pedagogic model at Roskilde University in Denmark. While the tradition of {PPL} has always promised a world-oriented and transformative alternative to traditional higher education, the article argues that this new global dimension presents an opportunity to renew the transformative potential of {PPL}. In particular, it argues that it can facilitate new ways of conceptualising the inquiry-problem in relation to the pedagogic idea of exemplary problems. Furthermore, problem-oriented approaches can generally be articulated with a more values-based conception of internationalisation and global justice, in order to enhance the transformative potential of these pedagogies. The article proposes that this enhanced conceptualization of world-orientation is an appropriate answer to the call for pedagogic responses to the existential threat posed by the climate crisis.","Warren, Simon",0,,2052
2093,Tides of Climate Change: Protecting the Natural Wealth Rights of Disappearing States,"Worldwide, there are approximately sixty states for which sea level rise is an existential threat. Described as the ""sinking island states,"" these low-lying ocean nations are battling with challenges that no other state has ever experienced. From a legal perspective, for the first time in human history, law must address the legal consequences of state extinction. One aspect of this new phenomenon is the question of what is to happen to the natural resource rights of a state that no longer exists. Much of the discussion surrounding this question is taking place in the abstract, such that scholars assume that complete loss of territory entails loss of statehood and therefore loss of rights to natural wealth. In this Article, I argue that we cannot assume what needs to be proven. To determine the impact of any legal event on legal rights, one must answer a series of questions pertaining to the nature of the rights, the character of the holder of the rights, the legal relationship that established the rights, and the circumstances that led to the legal went.

We examined the longitudinal relationships of religious beliefs (i.e., in God and in the afterlife) with well-being and distress (assessed 6 months later) in a sample of patients with congestive heart failure, a chronic and progressive disease. After controlling for religious service attendance, belief in God was associated with negative affect and spiritual well-being, while belief in the afterlife was associated with physical health, post-traumatic depreciation, and spiritual well-being. However, after controlling for baseline values of well-being or distress, religious beliefs were not associated with nearly all well-being or distress outcomes at follow-up. Over the 6-month duration of the study, participants increased in belief in afterlife but decreased in their belief in God. Increases in religious beliefs across time were associated with higher levels of distress. These results suggest that religious beliefs are neither positively nor negatively associated with well-being and distress independent of religious attendance among seriously ill patients with {CHF}. Based on these findings, healthcare providers are encouraged to assess religious belief change at the individual level to better understand and inform spiritual care for patients with late-stage {CHF}.","Carney, Lauren M. and Park, Crystal L. and Gutierrez, Ian A.",0,,2054
2095,Porousness and Peru's moratorium on genetically modified organisms: stakeholder epistemologies and neoliberal science,"In 2011 Peru became the first nation in Latin America to prohibit the importation of genetically modified material as well as its use in agricultural applications. To date Peru is one of just eight countries worldwide with such a comprehensive ban, and within Latin America, only Venezuela has followed suit. This paper takes up this historic legislation as a case study of knowledge production in the context of the politicization of science and the scientization of politics. Drawing from semi-structured interviews of three key stakeholder groups - representatives of the state, representatives of civil society and smallholder farmers - we trace the different ways of making sense of {GMOs} and their prohibition. We explore the different epistemologies that underlie different policy approaches. We find that despite their divergent policy prescriptions, representatives of the state and civil society approach the {GMO} moratorium from similar epistemological places. Both sets of stakeholders valorize science and economic development. In contrast, smallholder farmers, while converging with representatives of civil society on policy prescriptions, diverge epistemologically, articulating an agrarian discourse rooted in notions of place and 'good work.' They view {GMOs} less as an existential threat and more as extraneous and expensive. We develop the notion of porousness to describe the ruptures and overlaps in these heuristic categories of sense-making.","Dondanville, T. W. and Dougherty, Michael L.",0,,2055
2096,A comparison of {ISIS} foreign fighters and supporters social media posts: an exploratory mixed-method content analysis,"This paper compares the social media posts of {ISIS} foreign fighters to those of {ISIS} supporters. We examine a random sample of social media posts made by violent foreign fighters (n = 14; 2000 posts) and non-violent supporters (n = 18; 2000 posts) of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ({ISIS}) (overall n = 4,000 posts), from 2009 to 2015. We used a mixed-method study design. Our qualitative content analyses of the 4,000 posts identified five themes: Threats to in-group, societal grievances, pursuit for significance, religion, and commitment issues. Our quantitative comparisons found that the dominant themes in the foreign fighters' online content were threats to in-group, societal grievances, and pursuit for significance, while religion and commitment issues were dominant themes in the supporters' online content. We also identified thematic variations reflecting individual attitudes that emerged during the 2011-2015 period, when major geopolitical developments occurred in Syria and Iraq. Finally, our quantitative sentiment-based analysis found that the supporters (10 out of 18; 56\%) posted more radical content than the foreign fighters (5 out of 14; 36\%) on social media.","Dillon, Leevia and Neo, Loo Seng and Freilich, Joshua D.",0,,2056

2098,The End of the Affair with Life: Political Theory and the Corpse,"The relationship between death and politics figures prominently for us. However, the dead body has been neglected by this tradition. This paper shows how the figure of the corpse offers speculative resources in our contemporary moment, marked by conditions of existential threat and political decay. The paper discusses the ontological liveliness of the corpse, especially in relation to new materialism. The paper nevertheless draws our attention to the fact that the corpse is also the material site of an absolute loss. Accordingly, two developments for political theory become possible: a political phenomenology of loss and the approach of morbid opportunism.","Uhall, Michael",0,,2058
2099,"""In your head, zombie"": zombies, predation and memory","Imagining fictional creatures like zombies in survival situations boosts long-term memory for words encoded in these situations more than rating words for pleasantness (zombie effect). Study 1 required word-ratings in a zombie-survival scenario; participants were told they had to protect against either possible zombie attack or contamination. The zombie-survival situations yielded identical recall levels but higher recall rates than pleasantness. Study 2 matched a zombie-survival scenario on perceived fear with scenarios involving ghosts or predators. Perceived disgust in the zombie scenario was higher than in these other survival conditions. Words were remembered better when processed in survival scenarios than when rated for pleasantness, but there was no reliable difference in recall between the scenarios. In neither study did the number of death-related words produced in a word-fragment completion task fit the mortality salience account of the zombie memory effect. Overall findings suggest that this effect relates to the fear system.","Bonin, Patrick and Thiebaut, Gaetan and Prokop, Pavol and Meot, Alain",0,,2059

Empirical Evidence from 40-Plus Clients of Spanish Financial Advisory Firms,"This three-wave study analyses the mediating role of financial behavior in the relationship between financial goals and retirement saving adequacy, and the moderating role of Death anxiety. The participants in the study (N = 276) were 40-plus Spanish clients of financial advisory firms.

2101,"A Comparison of Death Anxiety, Intolerance of Uncertainty and Self-Esteem as Predictors of Social Anxiety Symptoms","This study sought to examine the role of death anxiety as a transdiagnostic predictor of social anxiety symptomatology compared to self-esteem and intolerance of uncertainty, and to examine the relationship between measures of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity and death anxiety. A total of 591 participants, 445 females, average age 38.0 years ({SD}= 14.5), completed an online survey including background questions, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Social Interaction Anxiety and Social Phobia Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire, the Spirituality Scale, and the Death Anxiety Scale. No significant, independent relationship was found between death anxiety and social anxiety symptomatology, although self-esteem and intolerance of uncertainty were significant predictors of both measures of social anxiety, confirming the importance of these key transdiagnostic mediators as predictors of social anxiety symptomatology. A strong negative correlation was found between death anxiety and measures of both intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity in this general population sample not selected for high religious affiliation.","Lowe, Juanita and Harris, Lynne M.",0,,2061
2102,Strength of socio-political attitudes moderates electrophysiological responses to perceptual anomalies,"People with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes have been shown to exhibit less phasic reactivity to perceptual anomalies, presumably to prevent their committed meaning systems from being challenged by novel experiences. Several researchers have proposed that (but not tested whether) firmly committed individuals also engage in more attentional suppression of anomalies, likely mediated by prestimulus alpha power. We expected participants with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes to display increased pre-stimulus alpha power when processing perceptual anomalies. We recorded electrophysiological activity during the presentation of normal cards (control group) or both normal and anomalous playing cards (experimental group; total N = 191). In line with our predictions, the presence of anomalous playing cards in the stimulus set increased prestimulus alpha power only among individuals with strong but not moderate political attitudes. As potential markers of phasic reactivity, we also analyzed the late positive potential ({LPP}) and earlier components of the event-related potential, namely P1, N1, and P300. The moderating effect of extreme attitudes on {ERP} amplitudes remained inconclusive. Altogether, our findings support the idea that ideological conviction is related to increased tonic responses to perceptual anomalies.","Reiss, Stefan and Klackl, Johannes and Proulx, Travis and Jonas, Eva",0,,2062
2103,Engaging with Online Extremist Material: Experimental Evidence,"Despite calls from governments to clamp down on violent extremist material in the online sphere, in the name of preventing radicalisation and therefore terrorism research investigating how people engage with extremist material online is surprisingly scarce. The current paper addresses this gap in knowledge with an online experiment. A fictional extremist webpage was designed and (student) participants chose how to engage with it. . A mortality salience prime (being primed to think of death) was also included. Mortality salience did not influence engagement with the material but the material itself may have led to disidentification with the ingroup. Whilst interaction with the material was fairly low, those that did engage tended to indicate preference for hierarchy and dominance in society, stronger identification with the ingroup, higher levels of radicalism, and outgroup hostility. More engagement with the online extremist material was also associated with increased likelihood of explicitly supporting the extremist group. These findings show that indoctrination, socialisation, and ideology are not necessarily required for individuals to engage attitudinally or behaviourally with extremist material. This study is not conducted on the dependent variable, therefore shedding light on individuals who do not engage with extremist material.","Reeve, Zoey",1,,2063
2104,The relationship between death anxiety and severity of mental illnesses,"Objectives Death anxiety has been implicated theoretically and empirically in mental health and has been proposed to be a transdiagnostic construct. However, it has largely been investigated in relation to specific disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Few studies have assessed the relationship between death anxiety and psychopathology using heterogeneous treatment-seeking clinical samples. Methods In the present study, the relationships between death anxiety and broad markers of psychopathology were explored in 200 treatment-seeking participants with various diagnosed mental disorders. Results Across the sample, death anxiety was a strong predictor of psychopathology, including the number of lifetime diagnoses, medications, hospitalizations, distress/impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress. This relationship was not accounted for by neuroticism. Large to very large correlations were also consistently found between a measure of death anxiety and the symptom severity of 12 disorders. Neither meaning in life nor attachment style moderated the associations between death fears and psychopathology. Conclusions The findings reveal a strong relationship between death anxiety and psychopathology across numerous disorders, further supporting the transdiagnostic role of fears of death. As such, clinical implications revolve around the potential need for innovative treatments which address death fears directly, in order to produce long-term improvements in mental health. However, experimental research is needed to ascertain causal relationships. Practitioner points Across a large treatment-seeking sample, death anxiety was a significant predictor of broad psychopathology, including distress and number of lifetime diagnoses. Across 12 different disorders, death anxiety significantly predicted symptom severity. Results may suggest the need for novel treatments which specifically target fears of death. Due to the correlational design, future experimental research is needed to establish causal relationships with increased confidence.","Menzies, Rachel E. and Sharpe, Louise and Dar-Nimrod, Ilan",0,,2064

Cyber-enabled information warfare has also become an existential threat in its own right, its increased use posing the possibility of a global information dystopia, in which the pillars of modern democratic self-government - logic, truth, and reality - are shattered, and anti-Enlightenment values undermine civilization as we know it around the world.","Lin, Herbert",0,,2065
2106,Identification of Primary Antimicrobial Resistance Drivers in Agricultural Nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica Serovars by Using Machine Learning,"Nontyphoidal Salmonella ({NTS}) is a leading global cause of bacterial foodborne morbidity and mortality. Our ability to treat severe {NTS} infections has been impaired by increasing antimicrobial resistance ({AMR}). To understand and mitigate the global health crisis {AMR} represents, we need to link the observed resistance phenotypes with their underlying genomic mechanisms. Broiler chickens represent a key reservoir and vector for {NTS} infections, but isolates from this setting have been characterized in only very low numbers relative to clinical isolates. In this study, we sequenced and assembled 97 genomes encompassing 7 serotypes isolated from broiler chicken in farms in British Columbia between 2005 and 2008. Through application of machine learning ({ML}) models to predict the observed {AMR} phenotype from this genomic data, we were able to generate highly (0.92 to 0.99) precise logistic regression models using known {AMR} gene annotations as features for 7 antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, and tetracycline). Similarly, we also trained ""reference-free"" k-merbased set-covering machine phenotypic prediction models (0.91 to 1.0 precision) for these antibiotics. By combining the inferred k-mers and logistic regression weights, we identified the primary drivers of {AMR} for the 7 studied antibiotics in these isolates. With our research representing one of the largest studies of a diverse set of {NTS} isolates from broiler chicken, we can thus confirm that the {AmpC}-like {CMY}-2 beta-lactamase is a primary driver of beta-lactam resistance and that the phosphotransferases {APH}(6)-Id and {APH}(3 ''-lb) are the principal drivers of streptomycin resistance in this important ecosystem. {IMPORTANCE} Antimicrobial resistance ({AMR}) represents an existential threat to the function of modern medicine. Genomics and machine learning methods are being increasingly used to analyze and predict {AMR}. This type of surveillance is very important to try to reduce the impact of {AMR}. Machine learning models are typically trained using genomic data, but the aspects of the genomes that they use to make predictions are rarely analyzed. In this work, we showed how, by using different types of machine learning models and performing this analysis, it is possible to identify the key genes underlying {AMR} in nontyphoidal Salmonella ({NTS}). {NTS} is among the leading cause of foodborne illness globally; however, {AMR} in {NTS} has not been heavily studied within the food chain itself. Therefore, in this work we performed a broad-scale analysis of the {AMR} in {NTS} isolates from commercial chicken farms and identified some priority {AMR} genes for surveillance.","Maguire, Finlay and Rehman, Muhammad Attiq and Carrillo, Catherine and Diarra, Moussa S. and Beiko, Robert G.",0,,2066
2107,"Resisting Extinction: Purple Martins, Death, and the Future","As a result of anthropogenically induced habitat destruction and climate change, the Eastern Purple Martin in North America has been transformed into a ""backyard bird,"" dependent on a network of ""landlords"" for nesting structures and protection from competitor species. While the orthodox approach to wildlife conservation tends to promote the continued existence of appropriate habitats, the conservation of the Eastern Purple Martin has hinged upon the continued existence of a specific human cultural behaviour. This landlording subculture, however, is now believed to be waning due to the aging demographics of the landlords themselves, threatening the long-term survival of the species. This article focuses on the relationships between 24 landlords-primarily older, white, southern {US} men-and their avian charges. The long-term bond between the birds and their human keepers meant that the landlords were confronting not only their own mortality but also the extinction of the birds to which they have devoted themselves. Their continuing struggles to recruit younger generations into landlording suggest the need for new models of martin conservation that can appeal to the post-domestic and internet savvy sensibilities of today's youth.","Jervis, Lori L. and Spicer, Paul and Foster, William C. and Kelly, Jeffrey and Bridge, Eli",0,,2067
2108,Shifts in tourists' sentiments and climate risk perceptions following mass coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef,"Iconic places, including World Heritage areas, are symbolic and synonymous with national and cultural identities. Recognition of an existential threat to an icon may therefore arouse public concern and protective sentiment. Here we test this assumption by comparing sentiments, threat perceptions and values associated with the Great Barrier Reef and climate change attitudes among 4,681 Australian and international tourists visiting the Great Barrier Reef region before and after mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017. There was an increase in grief-related responses and decline in self-efficacy, which could inhibit individual action. However, there was also an increase in protective sentiments, ratings of place values and the proportion of respondents who viewed climate change as an immediate threat. These results suggest that imperilled icons have potential to mobilize public support around addressing the wider threat of climate change but that achieving and sustaining engagement will require a strategic approach to overcome self-efficacy barriers.","Curnock, Matthew and Marshall, Nadine A. and Thiault, Lauric and Heron, Scott F. and Hoey, Jessica and Williams, Genevieve and Taylor, Bruce and Pert, Petina L. and Goldberg, Jeremy",0,,2068
2109,Self-esteem and sexual health: a multilevel meta-analytic review,"Sexual health reflects physical, emotional, mental, and social elements of sexual well-being. Researchers often position self-esteem (i.e., global or domain-specific evaluations of self) as a key correlate of sexual health. We present the first comprehensive meta-analysis of correlations between self-esteem and sexual health. Our synthesis includes 305 samples from 255 articles, containing 870 correlations from 191,161 unique participants. The overall correlation between self-esteem and sexual health was positive and small (r = .12, 95\% {CI}: .09, .15), characterised by considerable heterogeneity and robust to different corrections. Sexual functioning (r = .27, 95\% {CI}: .21, .34) was more strongly associated with self-esteem than were safe sex (r = .10, 95\% {CI}: .07, .13) and sexual consent (r = .19, 95\% {CI}: .13, .24), and sexual permissiveness was unassociated with self-esteem (r = -.02, 95\% {CI}: -.05, .008). Most moderators were nonsignificant, although moderator data were inconsistently available, and samples were North American-centric. Evidence of publication bias was inconsistent, and study quality, theory usage, and background research were not reliably associated with study outcomes. Our synthesis suggests a need for more specific theories of self-esteem corresponding to unique domains of sexual, highlighting a need for future theorising and research.","Sakaluk, John K. and Kim, James and Campbell, Emily and Baxter, Allegra and Impett, Emily A.",0,,2069
2110,Congruence of economic mobility beliefs and immigrants' self-esteem,"Purpose A dark side of global mobility is that many immigrants have negative work outcomes. Studies have analyzed the antecedents to poor work outcomes from the immigrants' point of view or from that of host country nationals. The purpose of this paper is to propose a relational model, which applies terror management theory to address how the economic mobility beliefs of immigrants and host country nationals interact and how these different combinations of beliefs affect the self-esteem of immigrants. Design/methodology/approach This theoretical model considers the impact of the social interactions between immigrants and host country nationals when immigrants' mortality is salient. Findings In hostile environments that make immigrants' mortality salient, lack of confirmation of immigrants' beliefs about economic mobility from host country nationals can lead to a decrease in immigrants' self-esteem and therefore to negative work outcomes. Practical implications As the number of immigrants grows, so do concerns about their ability to contribute to the economy. Lack of confirmation of their beliefs in a context in which their mortality is salient, is likely to lead to lower self-esteem and perhaps other negative outcomes. Originality/value This paper is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to use terror management theory to advance our understanding of the outcome of a lack of confirmation from host country nationals of immigrants' beliefs on economic mobility under conditions of mortality salience.","Guerrero, Laura and Hakak, Luciana Turchick",0,,2070

Design Systematic review and interpretative synthesis of primary qualitative studies. Papers were analysed using constant comparison and directed qualitative content analysis. Data sources {CINAHL}, {EMBASE}, {MEDLINE}, {PsychINFO}, Scopus and Web of Science searched from January 2006 to December 2015. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Primary qualitative studies in English where participants were patients with lung cancer or {COPD} and/or their informal caregivers, aged {\textgreater}18 years that contain descriptions of experiences of interacting with health or social care in Europe, North America and Australia. Results We identified 127 articles with 1769 patients and 491 informal caregivers. Patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals ({HCPs}) acknowledged lung cancer's existential threat. Managing treatment workload was a priority in this condition, characterised by a short illness trajectory. Treatment workload was generally well supported by an immediacy of access to healthcare systems and a clear treatment pathway. Conversely, patients, informal caregivers and {HCPs} typically did not recognise or understand {COPD}. Treatment workload was balanced with the demands of everyday life throughout a characteristically long illness trajectory. Consequently, treatment workload was complicated by difficulties of access to, and navigation of, healthcare systems, and a fragmented treatment pathway. In both conditions, patients' capacity to manage workload was enhanced by the support of family and friends, peers and {HCPs} and diminished by illness/smoking-related stigma and social isolation. Conclusion This interpretative synthesis has affirmed significant differences in treatment workload between lung cancer and {COPD}. It has demonstrated the importance of the capacity patients have to manage their workload in both conditions. This suggests a workload which exceeds capacity may be a primary driver of treatment burden.","Lippiett, Kate Alice and Richardson, Alison and Myall, Michelle and Cummings, Am and a and May, Carl R.",0,,2071
2112,States simply do not care: The failure of international securitisation of drug control in Afghanistan,"The link between the world drug problem and securitisation has been predominantly established to argue that an existential threat discourse reinforces the international prohibitionist regime and makes it harder for alternative policy models to arise. This analysis is problematic for three main reasons. Firstly, it overestimates the current strength of the international drug control regime as a normative and regulatory system that prescribes state behaviour. Secondly, the current international regime does not inhibit policy reforms. While the international treaty system proves resistant to change, it is at the national and local levels where new drug policies arise. Moreover, these are generally not the draconian or emergency measures that successful securitisation would predict. Thirdly, the analysis so far misinterprets criminalisation or militarisation as evidence of securitisation. As the case of Afghanistan shows, securitisation attempts, such as those linking the Taliban and the illicit opium economy, may have reinforced the militarisation of drug control in Afghanistan, but did not elevate the illicit drug economy as an external threat or a top priority. While there have been short-lived spikes of attention and provincial level campaigns to eradicate poppy cultivation, these have never translated into a sustained structural effort to combat illicit drugs in Afghanistan. Even the latest push for militarisation, the {US}-led campaign of airstrikes on drug processing laboratories since November 2017, represents more a shift in counter-insurgency strategy than successful securitisation. While Afghanistan's illicit drug economy has been politicised for several reasons, states are not convinced that this economy somehow represents an existential threat to their survival.","Kamminga, Jorrit",0,,2072
2113,Elicitation Enhanced the Yield of Glycyrrhizin and Antioxidant Activities in Hairy Root Cultures of Glycyrrhiza glabra L.,"Glycyrrhiza glabra L. has become an endangered medicinal plant due to the unabated extraction of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is a root centric secondary metabolite having numerous pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, antiulcer, and is found to be effective even against {HIV}. Harvesting of the roots for high value glycyrrhizin destroys the whole plant causing existential threat to the plant itself and consequent damage to biodiversity. The present study establishes that hairy root cultures of G. glabra, using an optimized elicitor, can dramatically enhance focused production of glycyrrhizin at a much faster pace year-round without causing destruction of the plant. Hairy root cultures of G. glabra were developed using the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 strain. The glycyrrhizin content was enhanced using different biotic and abiotic elicitors, for example, {PEG} (polyethylene glycol), {CdCl}2, cellulase, and mannan at different concentrations and durations. {PEG} at 1\% concentration enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin up to 5.4-fold after 24h of exposure, whereas 200 mu g {mL}(-1) cellulase enhanced glycyrrhizin yield to 8.6-fold after 7days of treatment. Mannan at 10mg L-1 concentration enhanced the production of glycyrrhizin up to 7.8-fold after 10days of stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, {SOD} activity was significantly enhanced under drought, cellulase and mannan stress. This identification of elicitors can result in abundant supply of valuable glycyrrhizin to meet broad spectrum demand through commercial production without endangering G. glabra L.","Srivastava, Mrinalini and Singh, Gaurav and Sharma, Swati and Shukla, Sudhir and Misra, Pratibha",0,,2073
2114,Securitizing the Muslim Brotherhood: State violence and authoritarianism in Egypt after the Arab Spring,"Unprecedented levels of state violence against the Muslim Brotherhood, and the widespread acceptance of this violence by Egyptians following the July 2013 military coup, have been under-examined by scholars of both critical security studies and Middle East politics, reflecting implicit assumptions that state violence is unexceptional beyond Europe. This article explores how the deployment of such levels of violence was enabled by a securitization process in which the Egyptian military successfully appropriated popular opposition to Muslim Brotherhood rule, constructing the group as an existential threat to Egypt and justifying special measures against it. The article builds on existing critiques of the Eurocentrism of securitization theory, alongside the writings of Antonio Gramsci, to further refine its application to non-democratic contexts. In addition to revealing the exceptionalism of state violence against the Muslim Brotherhood and highlighting the important role of nominally non-state actors in constructing the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat to Egypt, the article also signals the role of securitization in re-establishing authoritarian rule in the wake of the 2011 uprising. Thus, we argue that securitization not only constitutes a break from 'normal politics' but may also be integral to the reconstitution of 'normal politics' following a period of transition.","Pratt, Nicola and Rezk, Dina",0,,2074
2115,Dealing with the meat paradox: Threat leads to moral disengagement from meat consumption,"Meat consumption is conflicted, because meat provides pleasure to many people, but it also causes animals to suffer. This so-called meat paradox elicits discomfort in meat-eaters and they try to reduce their discomfort, for example, by means of moral disengagement. In the present investigation, we tried to scrutinize this process and examine the boundary conditions that increase moral disengagement. We assumed that, due to a domain general action-oriented state, people tend to resolve the meat paradox via moral disengagement, even if inconsistency is elicited in a different, not food-related domain. Two experiments were conducted, in which we assessed people's moral disengagement efforts via ambivalence measures after we induced inconsistency using different threats in meat-unrelated domains. Supporting our assumptions, people showed reduced ambivalence towards food in affective priming (Experiment 1) and Mouse-Tracker tasks (Experiment 2) after experiencing inconsistency. In fact, plant-based dishes became more positive and meat dishes more negative after inconsistency was induced, indicating that people disguise their endorsement of meat. This provides first convergent evidence that an inconsistency induced action-oriented state may influence cognitions regarding the meat paradox.","Buttlar, Benjamin and Walther, Eva",0,,2075
2116,The impact of Islamic State's ideological correction initiative on al Qaeda's bid for relevance,"Al Qaeda following 9-11 experienced a period of stagnation which it sought to remedy through a project of re-branding. Critical of this approach, Islamic State claimed that al Qaeda was an elitist organization that had facilitated the stagnation of the Salafi Jihadist project. In an attempted to claim dominance over the jihad, Islamic State's endeavored to discredit al Qaeda through a process it presented as ideological correction, linked to Islamic eschatology, sectarian agitation, permissive violence, and the caliphate. Following Islamic State's acquisition of vast territory in Iraq and Syria, arguments proliferated that Islamic State had surpassed al Qaeda. As the caliphate has collapsed what effects will this have on al Qaeda's fortunes and strategy? It is argued that Islamic State has provided al Qaeda's strategic approach with renewed vigour to help ensure its survival and pursue resurgence. Al Qaeda acting in concert with the meta-strategy for survival concept, has altered an existential threat into an advantage through disavowing Islamic State's methods, continuing to engage with localism, and pursuing rebranding by positioning itself as a moderate alternative. The cases of al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, Syria, West Africa, and South Asia are instructive in assessing the effectiveness of al Qaeda's resurgence.","Turner, John",0,,2076
2117,"Negative Experiences in Childhood, Parental Style, and Resilience Among People Reporting Paranormal Experiences","There are relatively few studies examining the parental style, childhood trauma, and paranormal experiences/beliefs; therefore, the aim of this study is to measure the dominant parental style of those who have experienced paranormal events and their correlation with negative events in childhood and resilience. Four questionnaires were administered to 644 participants. The results showed high frequency of experiences such as sense of presence, premonitory dreams, telepathy, mystical experiences, apparitions, and out-of-body experiences, among others. The results confirmed three hypotheses that predict a positive and significant correlation between the paranormal experiences in adult life and negative experiences in childhood, such as abuse and neglect. One possible interpretation is that ""flexible"" parental style is the more permissive ones (greater openness and sensitivity to capture alternative realities), in contrast to ""rigid"" parental style (whose perspectives generate restrictions to capitalize on the unconventional experiences of their children).","Parra, Alej and ro",0,,2077
2118,"""I was hungry and you gave me food"": Religiosity and attitudes toward redistribution","Current literature presents conflicting findings concerning the effect of religiosity on attitudes towards redistribution. This paper attempts to reconcile these findings by arguing that the belief and social behavior dimensions of religiosity affect support for redistribution via different mechanisms, and that these effects are moderated by state welfare generosity. Using multilevel path analysis models on data from the World Values Survey, we show that the effect of the religious belief on attitudes towards redistribution is mediated by competing personal orientations-prosocial values and conservative identification-while the religious social behavior dimension significantly decreases support for redistribution via increased levels of happiness. Lower levels of welfare generosity increase the positive effect of prosocial orientations and weaken the negative effect conservative identification, leading to positive or null indirect effect of religiosity. These findings show the importance of taking into account the multiple dimensions of religiosity and institutional context when studying the relationship between religion and redistribution attitudes.","Arikan, Gizem and Bloom, Pazit Ben-Nun",0,,2078
2119,Threat appeals reduce impulsive decision making associated with texting while driving: A behavioral economic approach,"The primary purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of threat appeals in influencing impulsive decision making associated with texting while driving. The participants in the treatment group were exposed to a threatening message about the danger of texting while driving, whereas those in the control group were exposed to a nonthreatening message. Following the exposure to either message, the participants completed a delay-discounting task that assessed the degree of impulsive decision making in a hypothetical texting-while-driving scenario. A comparison between the groups revealed that the threat appeals reduced the degree of impulsive decision making associated with texting while driving. In addition, the threat appeals led to greater anticipated regret from texting while driving, less favorable attitudes toward texting while driving, and decreased intentions to text while driving in the future in the treatment group. These results suggest that video based threat appeals are promising intervention strategies for the public health challenge of texting while driving. Implications from the behavioral economic perspective are discussed.","Hayashi, Yusuke and Foreman, Anne M. and Friedel, Jonathan E. and Wirth, Oliver",0,,2079
2120,War increases religiosity,"Does the experience of war increase people's religiosity? Much evidence supports the idea that particular religious beliefs and ritual forms can galvanize social solidarity and motivate in-group cooperation, thus facilitating a wide range of cooperative behaviours including-but not limited to-peaceful resistance and collective aggression. However, little work has focused on whether violent conflict, in turn, might fuel greater religious participation. Here, we analyse survey data from 1,709 individuals in three post-conflict societies-Uganda, Sierra Leone and Tajikistan. The nature of these conflicts allows us to infer, and statistically verify, that individuals were quasirandomly afflicted with different intensities of war experience-thus potentially providing a natural experiment. We then show that those with greater exposure to these wars were more likely to participate in Christian or Muslim religious groups and rituals, even several years after the conflict. The results are robust to a wide range of control variables and statistical checks and hold even when we compare only individuals from the same communities, ethnic groups and religions.","Henrich, Joseph and Bauer, Michal and Cassar, Aless and ra and Chytilova, Julie and Purzycki, Benjamin Grant",1,,2080
2121,"A Path to Artificial Intelligence - Intelligent Systems and Applications, Intellisys, Vol 2","To build a safe system that would replicate and perhaps transcend human-level intelligence, three basic modules: objective, agent, and perception are proposed for development. The objective module would ensure that the system acts in humanity's interest, not against it. It would have two components: a network of machine learning agents to address the problem of value alignment and a distributed ledger to propose a mechanism to mitigate the existential threat. The agent module would further develop the Dyna concept and benefit from a treatise in sociology to build the missing link of artificial general intelligence, a world simulator. The perception module would estimate the state of the world and benefit from existing machine learning algorithms enhanced by a new paradigm in hardware design, a quantum computer. This paper describes a way in which such a system could be built, analyzing the current state of the art and providing alternative directions for research rather than concrete, industry-ready solutions.","Dronic, Ion",0,,2081
2122,{CARVE}: A Scientific Method-Based Threat Hunting Hypothesis Development Model,"A threat hunting exercise is a hypothesis driven exploratory and explanatory research process, the exercise is inherently scientific in nature and lends itself to the application of the scientific method of hypothesis development. The exercise commences with exploratory steps in the threat hypothesis phase to develop a logical argument asserting an existential threat, then follows with explanatory steps in the threat hunt phase to validate the argument. To deem a threat credible, that is, valid and relevant, a threat hunting hypothesis must establish a correlational and causal relationship between the asserted threat and a targeted asset, the hypothesis must adhere to the constructs of the scientific method for the exercise to be defined and measured objectively, and yield valuable and repeatable outcomes. Lack of adherence to the scientific method increases the frequency of invalid and/or irrelevant propositions in threat hypotheses, which diminishes Return on Investment ({ROI}) in cybersecurity defensive efforts due to wasted cycles of threat hunting exercises. This paper proposes a scientific method-based model, Collect Analyze Relate Validate Establish ({CARVE}), which can be used to develop valid and relevant threat hunting hypotheses in the context of a given organization's information system and environment. The {CARVE} model is defined by the following live steps: Collect, Analyze, Relate, Validate, and Establish. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated using a case study based on the technical alert United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team ({US} {CERT}) {TA}17-293A.","Wafula, Kevin and Wang, Yong",0,,2082
2123,The Anatomy of a Moral Panic: Western Mainstream Media's Russia Scapegoat,"Since 2014, there has been a very concerted campaign launched by the neo-liberal Western mainstream mass media against Russia. The format and content suggest that this is an attempt to induce a moral panic among the Western publics. It seems to be intended to create a sense of fear and to switch the logic to a series of emotionally-based reactions to assertion propaganda. Russia has been variously blamed for many different events and trends around the world, such as the ""destroying"" of Western ""democracy', and democratic values. In many regards, Russia is projected as being an existential threat in both the physical and intangible realms. This paper traces the strategic messages and narratives of the ""Russia threat"" as it is presented in Western mainstream media. Russia is connoted as a scapegoat for the failings of the neo-liberal democratic political order to maintain its global hegemony; therefore, Russia is viewed as the ""menacing"" other and a desperate measure to halt this gradual decline and loss of power and influence. This ultimately means that this type of journalism fails in its supposed fourth estate role, by directly aiding the hegemonic political power.","Simons, Greg",0,,2083
2124,Boko Haram insurgency and the necessity for trans-territorial forestland governance in the Lower Lake Chad Basin,"The significance of forests as an existential threat to national security in Nigeria has been underscored in the phenomenon of Boko Haram insurgency. The occupation and apparent 'weaponisation' of Sambisa and the adjoining forests by Boko Haram insurgents have continued to pose an enervating tactical challenge that complicates the ongoing counterinsurgency efforts in northeast Nigeria. The instrumentalisation of forests as an operational and defensive stronghold by the insurgents in the lower Lake Chad Basin has been enabled by the existence of large expanses of dispersed, uninhabited and un-policed forested spheres in the area. This study examines the imperative for transnational forestland governance in the lower Lake Chad Basin, in the light of a continual incidence of Boko Haram insurgency in that context. Drawing discursively from the 'ungoverned spaces' (territorial ungovernability) hypothesis, the study posits that the prevailing vacuum of effective forestland governance in the region must be filled in order to mitigate the security challenge. To that end, the study prescribes a strategic trans-territorial forestland governance regime whereby Nigeria and Cameroon synergise efforts in bringing about effective reclamation and occupation of the volatile forested landscapes.","Okoli, Al Chukwuma",0,,2084

2126,Environmental worldview beliefs and {CSR} advertising,"Purpose This paper aims to show how environment-related worldview beliefs, in addition to specific persuasion knowledge, can influence how a consumer responds to ads about corporate social responsibility ({CSR}) projects. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments manipulated ad copy and consumers' persuasion knowledge to examine the effects of consumers' environmental worldview beliefs on their judgments of a firm's {CSR} reforestation project. Findings When an ad presented ambiguous information, both consumers' persuasion knowledge and their environmental worldview influenced the attribution of the firm's motives. When an ad presented environment-specific information, however, consumers' worldview did not influence their attribution of motives. Attributions, in turn, predicted attitudes toward the ad and attitudes toward the brand and were associated with intentions for information-seeking and referral behavior. Research limitations/implications A consumer's core beliefs can play an important role in understanding the application of persuasion knowledge, and the reinforcement-of-meaning principle expands the persuasion knowledge model's explanatory power. Practical implications Marketing communications that involve social responsibility projects must take into account how core beliefs can influence the way consumers respond to projects. Social implications This research demonstrates the importance of worldview beliefs in communication that takes place in the public sphere. Originality/value The experiments' results contribute to a more robust understanding of the persuasion knowledge model, particularly as it applies to {CSR} messages and introduces the reinforcement-of-meaning principle.","Magee, Robert G.",0,,2086
2127,Religion and Identity. The Threat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,"The Islamic State's actions in northern Iraq represented an existential threat to the different societal groups that inhabited the territories that were held by the self-proclaimed caliphate. However, its actions are not senseless violence, irrationality or brutality. These are part of the Salafist conception, which indicates that Islam is in existential risk, therefore, violence against minorities is considered necessary to defend monotheism (tawhid) and the fight against polytheism (shirk) and the infidels (kuffar). The article analyzes how the securitization of religion carried out by the Islamic State represents a threat to minority groups in Iraq and Syria.","Ospina Morales, Guillermo",0,,2087
2128,Discourses of Exclusion: The Societal Securitization of Burma's Rohingya (2012-2018),"The contemporary persecution of Burma's Rohingya has rapidly evolved from isolated episodes of communal violence into a global humanitarian crisis. The article analyses the evolution of the recent violence in Rakhine State from 2012 to the present. Specifically, I argue that Buddhist nationalist monks, including members of the '969' Movement and Ma Ba Tha, in concert with the Burmese government, have acted as authoritative voices in society, depicting the Rohingya ethno-religious group as an existential threat to the country's majority Buddhist population. As such, hate-filled rhetoric has provided a politically unstable Burmese regime with an ideological justification for human rights abuses committed in Rakhine State. This phenomenon is analysed through Barry Buzan and Ole Waever's securitization thesis as a means of better understanding the discursive relationship among Buddhist nationalist monks, the Burmese government and the Burmese Buddhists. Ontologically, this article focuses on anti-Rohingya discourse and major episodes of violence in western Burma's Rakhine State from 2012 to 2018. As a discursive process, securitization has not merely amplified Islamophobia within Burma, but significantly endangers future generations of Rohingya civilians.","Howe, Adam E.",0,,2088
2129,{INVESTORS} {AS} {REGULATORS}: {GREEN} {BONDS} {AND} {THE} {GOVERNANCE} {CHALLENGES} {OF} {THE} {SUSTAINABLE} {FINANCE} {REVOLUTION},"This Article examines the role of the global financial markets in promoting sustainability and the governance challenges arising from this phenomenon. A growing range of financial instruments and strategies catalyze the desire of investors and corporations to support environmentally and socially sustainable commercial activity. This Article focuses on green bonds, a form of debt financing whose proceeds are specifically dedicated to environmentally-friendly ""green"" projects, assets, and business activities. Having emerged in the past three years, green bonds are expected to play an integral role in responding to the existential threat and enormous costs posed by climate change. Largely missing from the still-nascent green bond market are government regulators. Instead, its governance is decentralized and primarily shaped by private governance regimes (such as investment standards, certification schemes, ratings, and third-party assessment), which compete or collaborate with each other for market adoption. In comparison to public regulation, private governance is often faster to implement and more responsive to the needs of market participants but may suffer from a lack of legitimacy, accountability, and consistency and be susceptible to greenwashing. To address these deficits, this Article identifies and analyzes governance gaps in the green bond market and outlines a public-private hybrid regulatory framework to optimize the interests of investors and stakeholders.","Park, Stephen Kim",0,,2089
2130,The effects of psychosocial interventions on death anxiety: A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomised controlled trials,"Death anxiety has been proposed as a transdiagnostic construct, underlying numerous mental disorders. Although it has been argued that treatments, which reduce death anxiety, are needed, research investigating the impact of interventions on death fears has produced mixed results. As such, the current meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of psychosocial interventions on death anxiety. Overall, results from 15 randomised controlled trials suggested that psychosocial treatments produced significant reductions in death anxiety, with a small to medium effect size (g = .45). Intervention type (death education vs. therapy) did not significantly moderate the effect of intervention on death anxiety (g = -.47). However, therapy type was a significant moderator of treatment efficacy (g = -1.39). Cognitive Behaviour Therapy was found to be particularly efficacious, producing significant reductions in death anxiety relative to control (g = 1.7), whereas other therapies did not (g = .20). The number of treatment sessions and baseline death anxiety significantly moderated intervention efficacy, whereas the duration of the intervention, training of the interventionist, and clinical nature of the sample did not. Given the small number and generally low quality of the included studies, future research using more rigorous methodology, as well as clinical samples, is needed.","Menzies, Rachel E. and Zuccala, Matteo and Sharpe, Louise and Dar-Nimrod, Ilan",0,,2090
2131,Losing Health Symbols Because of Nutrition-Related Problems in Advanced Cancer: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis,"Cancer and nutrition-related problems are extremely distressing events and disturb functioning and daily life. It is recognized that the effects of stressors challenging well-being are mediated by the meaning attached to these stressors. As nutrition-related problems are often being experienced within couples, it is also important to gain understanding of a partner's interpretation of complaints and whether it coincides with that of the patient. To explore the meaning attached to nutrition-related problems, a qualitative approach was followed. Seven couples, each composed of a patient with cancer and his/her cohabiting life partner, participated. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed by an interpretative phenomenological approach. Nutrition-related problems among patients with advanced cancer are mostly perceived as destroying health and leading to loss of physical, psychological, and social health symbols. Because the meaning patients and their partners attach to nutrition-related problems is individual and dynamic, it is necessary to devote special attention to the issues on different occasions. The study findings can assist nurses and other professional caregivers in providing psychological support for couples confronted with nutrition-related problems in advanced cancer. It is important to take into account the meaning patients and partners attach to these nutrition-related problems.","Opsomer, Sophie and Joossens, Sofie and De Wit, Claudia and Lauwerier, Emelien and Pype, Peter",0,,2091
2132,"Meaning of life, representation of death, and their association with psychological distress","Objective:This paper presents a two-phase cross-sectional study aimed at examining the possible mitigating role of perceived meaning of life and representation of death on psychological distress, anxiety, and depression.Method:The first phase involved 219 healthy participants, while the second encompassed 30 cancer patients. Each participant completed the Personal Meaning Profile ({PMP}), the Testoni Death Representation Scale ({TDRS}), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ({HADS}), and the Distress Thermometer ({DT}). The primary analyses comprised (1) correlation analyses between the overall scores of each of the instruments and (2) path analysis to assess the indirect effect of the {PMP} on {DT} score through anxiety and depression as determined by the {HADS}.Results:The path analysis showed that the {PMP} was inversely correlated with depression and anxiety, which, in turn, mediated the effect on distress. Inverse correlations were found between several dimensions of the {PMP}, the {DT}, and the {HADS}-Anxiety and {HADS}-Depression subscales, in both healthy participants and cancer patients. Religious orientation (faith in God) was related to a stronger sense of meaning in life and the ontological representation of death as a passage, rather than annihilation.Significance of Results:Our findings support the hypothesis that participants who represent death as a passage and have a strong perception of the meaning of life tend to report lower levels of distress, anxiety, and depression. We recommend that perceived meaning of life and representation of death be more specifically examined in the cancer and palliative care settings.","Testoni, Ines and Sansonetto, Giulia and Ronconi, Lucia and Rodelli, Maddalena and Baracco, Gloria and Grassi, Luigi",0,,2092
2133,Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation of the Posterior Medial Frontal Cortex to Experimentally Reduce Ideological Threat Responses,"Decades of behavioral science research have documented functional shifts in attitudes and ideological adherence in response to various challenges, but little work to date has illuminated the neural mechanisms underlying these dynamics. This paper describes how continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation may be employed to experimentally assess the causal contribution of cortical regions to threat-related ideological shifts. In the example protocol provided here, participants are exposed to a threat prime-an explicit reminder of their own inevitable death and bodily decomposition-following a downregulation of the posterior medial frontal cortex ({pMFC}) or a sham stimulation. Next, disguised within a series of distracter tasks, participants' relative degree of ideological adherence is assessed-in the present example, with regard to coalitional prejudice and religious belief. Participants for whom the {pMFC} has been downregulated exhibit less coalitionally biased responses to an immigrant critical of the participants' national in-group, and less conviction in positive afterlife beliefs (i.e., God, angels, and heaven), despite having recently been reminded of death. These results complement prior findings that continuous theta burst stimulation of the {pMFC} influences social conformity and sharing and illustrate the feasibility of investigating the neural basis of high-level social cognitive shifts using transcranial magnetic stimulation.","Holbrook, Colin and Gordon, Chelsea L. and Iacoboni, Marco",0,,2093
2134,The cognitive science of religion: Implications for morality,"A cognitive scientific approach to religion reveals the moral role of religion in human evolutionary history and provides insight into the continuing influence of religion in human affairs. While morality can be understood and justified apart from any religious foundation, religion cannot be separated from its moral function. After setting out the evolved cognitive bases of religious beliefs and behaviors, a model for the nexus between religion and morality is developed. From this it follows that religions constitute moral worldviews that emerge from and tap into deep moral and emotional instincts. This makes religion, and moral worldviews more generally, profoundly important, but also makes them dangerously problematic. A case study of the intersection of religion, race, and politics in contemporary American presidential politics will be used to explicate these ideas.","Teehan, John",0,,2094
2135,Revisiting the Effects of Societal Threat Perceptions on Conflict-related Positions: A Three-wave Study,"Past research has produced convincing evidence for the association between perceived societal threat and political conservatism. Based on the view of political worldviews and threat perceptions as multifaceted constructs, the present study suggests that certain types of perceived threat are actually associated with the endorsement of more politically liberal positions. Employing a three-wave naturalistic design, we examined the unique longitudinal effects of perceived threats from real-life political events that challenge either liberal or conservative values, on conflict-related attitudes, using a nationally representative sample of Jewish-Israelis (N = 437). Consistent with our hypotheses, perceived threat from events that challenge conservative values was associated with increased militaristic attitudes and decreased willingness to compromise for peace over time, whereas perceived threat from events that challenge liberal values was related to decreased militaristic attitudes and increased willingness to compromise for peace over time. Theoretical and practical implications of these longitudinal effects are discussed.","Elad-Strenger, Julia and Shahar, Golan",0,,2095
2136,Acute intermittent hypoxia with concurrent hypercapnia evokes P2X and {TRPV}1 receptor-dependent sensory long-term facilitation in naive carotid bodies,"Apnoeas constitute an acute existential threat to neonates and adults. In large part, this threat is detected by the carotid bodies, which are the primary peripheral chemoreceptors, and is combatted by arousal and acute cardiorespiratory responses, including increased sympathetic output. Similar responses occur with repeated apnoeas but they continue beyond the last apnoea and can persist for hours [i.e. ventilatory and sympathetic long-term facilitation ({LTF})]. These long-term effects may be adaptive during acute episodic apnoea, although they may prolong hypertension causing chronic cardiovascular impairment. We report a novel mechanism of acute carotid body ({CB}) plasticity (sensory {LTF}) induced by repeated apnoea-like stimuli [i.e. acute intermittent hypoxia coincident with bouts of hypercapnia ({AIH}-Hc)]. This plasticity did not require chronic intermittent hypoxia preconditioning, was dependent on P2X receptors and protein kinase C, and involved heat-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 ({TRPV}1) receptors. Reactive oxygen species (O-2(-)) were involved in initiating plasticity only; no evidence was found for H2O2 involvement. Angiotensin {II} and 5-{HT} receptor antagonists, losartan and ketanserin, severely reduced {CB} responses to individual hypoxic-hypercapnic challenges and prevented the induction of sensory {LTF} but, if applied after {AIH}-Hc, failed to reduce plasticity-associated activity. Conversely, {TRPV}1 receptor antagonism had no effect on responses to individual hypoxic-hypercapnic challenges but reduced plasticity-associated activity by similar to 50\%. Further, {TRPV}1 receptor antagonism in vivo reduced sympathetic {LTF} caused by {AIH}-Hc, although only if the {CBs} were functional. These data demonstrate a new mechanism of {CB} plasticity and suggest P2X-{TRPV}1-dependent sensory {LTF} as a novel target for pharmacological intervention in some forms of neurogenic hypertension associated with recurrent apnoeas.","Roy, Arijit and Farnham, Melissa M.

2137,Public Reactions to Male Versus Female Terrorism: Experimental Evidence for the Male Warrior Hypothesis,"One of the most consistent findings in the domain of criminal justice is that female and male offenders are perceived differently, often resulting in milder sentencing of women compared to men. Although previous studies have sought to identify factors that shape public reactions to terrorism and support for harsh interrogation techniques in its aftermath, empirical studies on differential reactions to female (vs. male) terrorist violence remain scarce. Here, it is argued that the often-violent evolutionary history of our species has shaped the way in which we perceive and react to female (vs. male) terrorist violence. Based on the framework of coalitional psychologyand specifically, the male warrior hypothesisthe assumption is tested that terror-suspect sex, in interaction with other threat cues such as in- or out-group membership and size of coalition, affects support for interrogational torture. This prediction was tested by conducting a survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of 2,126 U.S. adults. Results demonstrated that terror-suspect sex significantly shapes reactions to and perceptions of terrorist violence. Further, nuanced responses based on respondent sex revealed that these associations were exclusively driven by male participants. Gender attitudes and mere punitiveness did not account for the findings, suggesting that male coalitional psychology is deeply ingrained and readily activated by cues implying intergroup conflict.","Lindner, Miriam",0,,2097
2138,Teaching as an Immortality Project: Positing Weakness in Response to Terror,"Teaching as a profession can be read as an immortality project, a form of compensation to help resolve a certain kind of existential terror. Terror management theory can help us understand the ways teachers might compensate for their limitedness as humans by imposing prescribed attributes on their students. In response to the freighted reality of teaching as quasi-missionary work, we suggest a new orientation, namely that the profession embrace the terror of the future that it cannot know. Through a theoretical engagement with Weak Theology in the context of Eugene Thacker's philosophical doomcore', we hope to re-orient the educational project into one with lower stakes, a shift from immortality to more goodness'. The desired result is to refocus on the relationships we develop with other humans as well as with the planet.","Van Kessel, Cathryn and Burke, Kevin",0,,2098

A seminal study of headwater streams across the United States concluded that in-stream removal of nitrate is controlled primarily by stream chemistry and biology. Reanalysis of these data reveals that stream turbulence (in particular, turbulent mass transfer across the concentration boundary layer) imposes a previously unrecognized upper limit on the rate at which nitrate is removed fromstreams. The upper limit closely approximates measured nitrate removal rates in streams with low concentrations of this pollutant, a discovery that should inform stream restoration designs and efforts to assess the effects of nitrogen pollution on receiving water quality and the global nitrogen cycle.","Grant, Stanley B. and Azizian, Morvarid and Cook, Perran and Boano, Fulvio and Rippy, Megan A.",0,,2100
2141,Obama and Afghanistan: a constructivist approach to shifting policy narrative and practices,"This article adopts a constructivist approach to explain how and why the Obama administration shifted its policy narrative and practices towards Afghanistan from 2011 onwards. It recognizes that the Global War on Terror' narrative helped pave the way for a set of institutionalized militarized practices and collectively held beliefs that have structured the post-9/11 world. At the same time, the article argues that the Obama administration's selling' of its Afghan policy provided the space for an evolving approach. This policy narrative involved the existential threat' of transnational militant actors operating out of an Afghanistan-Pakistan ungoverned space being downgraded to a containable' one. Three key factors prompted this change: the administration's discursive decoupling of the Taliban and al-Qaeda; the changing perception that the threat posed by al-Qaeda and its affiliates' was a decentralized one; and the United States' changed conception of Afghanistan as a safe haven' for transnational terrorists.","Teitler, Anthony",0,,2101
2142,Religiosity and Support for Killing Animals: Evidence of a Curvilinear Relationship,"Prior research shows that the correlation between religiosity and support for animal rights can be positive, negative, or zero. We hypothesized that this relationship may actually be curvilinear, where a moderate degree of religiosity may reduce support for killing animals (compared with non-religiosity or atheism), but a very high degree of religiosity (e.g., fundamentalism) might increase support for killing animals. We tested this hypothesis in a large sample of American undergraduate students, using a correlational study design with self-report measures of religiosity and of support for killing animals in different domains. The results indicated that, in support of our hypothesis, the relationship between religiosity and support for killing animals is curvilinear, as moderate levels of religiosity were related to less support for killing animals. People who were either not religious at all or very religious were the ones who most supported the killing of animals. Belief in God in itself was related to less support for killing animals. We then replicated the curvilinear relationship between religiosity and support for killing animals using data from four experiments from a previously published article on support for killing animals. We briefly consider possible explanations for these findings, the limitations of the study, and propose directions for future research. Overall, we believe that this study helps clarify the complex relationship between religiosity and support for killing animals, and advances the scientific understanding of the psychological forces that motivate people to support or object to the killing of animals.","Lifshin, Uri and Greenberg, Jeff and Sullivan, Daniel",0,,2102
2143,"Anxiety about digital security and terrorism, and support for counter-terror measures","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the potential predictors of anxiety about digital security, terrorist threats and support for high-tech counter measures. Design/methodology/approach In Study 1, 195 participants indicated their anxiety about digital security systems, data protection and social networking sites. In Study 2, 107 participants indicated their anxiety about domestic terrorism, international terrorism and extremist groups. In Study 3, 261 participants indicated their support for high-tech counter-terrorism measures. Findings Study 1 suggests that whereas anxiety about digital security systems, data protection and social networking sites was positively predicted by right-wing authoritarianism, anxiety about social networking was also negatively predicted by time spent online. Study 2 shows that time spent online was a negative predictor of anxiety about domestic terrorism. Study 3 indicates that the strongest positive predictor of support for all the measures was right-wing authoritarianism, followed by national identity. Research limitations/implications The findings show the relevance of terror management theory to digital security and counter-terrorism. Practical implications It appears that right-wing authoritarianism and national identity may serve as mechanisms for people to subjectively counter the presented threats. This notion may inform relevant policy and practice aimed at making communities safer and potentially helps introduce counter-terror measures with less public backlash. Social implications When designing counter-terror measures, policy makers should consider compound national identities (e.g. Catalan or Basque people). Originality/value The paper makes contribution to under-explored areas of terrorism anxiety and support for counter-terror measures.","Gallova, Viktoria and Palasinski, Marek and Shortl and , Neil and Humman, Michael and Grieve, Lorraine Bowman",0,,2103
2144,From Family Values to Religious Freedom: Conservative Discourse and the Politics of Gay Rights,"On the issue of gay rights, today's social conservatives are more likely to describe their opposition as a matter of religious freedom or personal conscience as opposed to a belief that gays and lesbians represent an existential threat to the traditional family. But how new is this contemporary argument, and how different is it from the family values politics of the previous era? This article develops what Victoria Hattam and Joseph Lowndes call ""associative chains"" from two important moments in anti-gay politics: Anita Bryant's Save Our Children campaign and Kim Davis's decision to not issue gay marriage licenses in Rowan County, {KY}. On one level, these moments reveal competing roles of the state in the lives of its citizens. Family values politics authorized an interventionist state for the protection of children, while religious freedom defenders promote a zone of personal conscience impervious to the state. On another level, however, these moments reveal the mutability of social conservative opposition to gay rights. Calls for protecting religious freedom preserve a heterosexism derived from antecedent family values politics. The novelty of religious freedom as a defense for homophobia obscures a persistent social conservative commitment to using the state to enshrine the heteronuclear family.","Williams, H.

2146,The Power and Limits of Cultural Myths in Portugal's Search for a Post-Imperial Role,"The central role in Portuguese political culture of the identification of Portugal as a colonizing power legitimized a massive mobilization and violent response to the perceived existential threat of decolonization in the shape of prolonged wars in its main African colonies (1961-1974). If, however, this cultural myth of a Greater Portugal overseas was so powerful, how was decolonization eventually possible? The accumulated human and economic cost of facing three simultaneous, protracted anti-colonial insurgencies eroded this overseas creed and made Catholic and Marxist strands of anti-colonialism increasingly attractive to younger, more internationally connected, Portuguese elites. What also happened, however, this article will argue, was a refashioning of the powerful cultural myth of a special connection between Portugal and tropical Africa. A colonial myth was turned into a post-colonial myth legitimizing decolonization as a mutual and fraternal liberation from the same oppressive regime without a loss of strong 'natural' cultural bonds. More widely, the article aims to show that we cannot ignore the importance of cultural factors in international history. Our approach in this article is pluralist and this means that while arguing strongly for taking culture seriously and focusing on it, it does consider other, including more material, dimensions of power.","Reis, Bruno C. and Oliveira, Pedro A.",0,,2106
2147,"Explaining the Chinese framing of the ""terrorist"" violence in Xinjiang: insights from securitization theory","This paper critically examines the Chinese framing of the ""terrorist"" violence in Xinjiang. Drawing on the Copenhagen school of securitization theory, it examines how the historical perception of the region as a primary source of security threats to inner China has led today's China to continue with representing the Han Chinese-Uyghur discord as an existential threat. In framing the ethnic conflict as a security issue, China has capitalized on the global ""war on terror"" of the early 2000s to transform the unrest into acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its counter-insurgency policies in Xinjiang. However, both the 2009 Urumqi riots and the 2014 Kunming attack lead us to conclude that the securitization strategy fails to quell the unrest. Not only have the Strike-Hard campaigns served to radicalize Uyghur nationalists, but also Han Chinese are not convinced that the Chinese government can contain the ""terrorist"" threat. Yet securitization blinds the leadership to the dysfunctional ethnic policy.","Tredaniel, Marie and Lee, Pak K.",0,,2107
2148,Subjective nearness to death and end-of-life anxieties: the moderating role of ageism,"Objectives: Subjective nearness to death ({SNtD}), or individuals' subjective evaluation of how close they are to death, has been demonstrated to be an important predictor for different aspects of the individual's aging process across the life cycle. However, the relationship between {SNtD} and anxieties linked with the aging process has not been examined among individuals who may be in the initial stages of experiencing the first physical and cognitive signs of aging. Thus, this study examined the association between {SNtD} and aging, dying, and death anxieties. Moreover, the role of ageism, or negative attitudes toward older adults, as a moderator for these perceptions regarding the end of life has not been addressed. Moreover, we examined whether ageism serves as a moderator for the aforementioned association.Method: A convenience sample of 1146 Israeli participants, ranging in age from 45 to 65, filled out scales assessing {SNtD}, aging anxiety, dying anxiety, death anxiety, and ageism.Results: High levels of {SNtD} were positively associated with aging, dying, and death anxieties. Moreover, there was a positive association between ageism and the three end-of-life anxieties. Significant interactions demonstrated the moderating effect of ageism for the relationship between {SNtD} and both aging and dying anxieties, but not for death anxiety.Conclusion: {SNtD} is an important construct, which is connected to various perceptions and anxieties concerning the aging and dying processes. Moreover, while high ageism mitigates the positive association between {SNtD} and certain anxieties, the role of ageism is more complicated, and its negative aspects are discussed.","Bergman, Yoav S. and Bodner, Ehud and Shrira, Amit",0,,2108
2149,Beyond consumption: the promising contribution of voluntary simplicity,"Purpose Greater contribution of voluntary simplicity to sustainability may extend beyond the scope of consumption behavior. This paper aims to argue that work behavior is also important and it explores how and why personal consumption of the voluntary simplifiers relates to the way they work. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative study uses in-depth interviews to explore the consumption-work experience relationship and driving values of voluntary simplifiers. Thailand is the chosen context, as it represents an emerging economy aiming to converge economic growth and sufficiency. Findings The findings demonstrate that, driven mainly by contentment and integrity, simple living complements leisurely, meaningful and, most intriguingly, ethical work. In return, such work behavior provides enough earnings and fulfills the beginners, as well as the progressive and extensive simplifiers. Research limitations/implications The consumption-work relationship model of the voluntary simplifiers provides an alternative starting point for further research and practice to tackle overconsumption, inequality, inequity and corruption - the critical challenges of sustainability. Originality/value This research takes a more complete approach to study the voluntary simplifiers. The empirical results demonstrate the greater scope of voluntary simplicity literature beyond sustainable consumption and work-life balance. Based on the consumption-work relationship driven mainly by contentment and integrity, this paper proposes meaningful and ethical work as the promising contribution of voluntary simplicity to sustainability.","Kraisornsuthasinee, Suthisak and Swierczek, Fredric William",0,,2109
2150,The Socio-scientific Construction of Global Climate Crisis,"This article adapts and applies a securitisation framework to produce an analytical explanation for the heightened geopolitical status of climate change over the past decade, as demonstrated by the breakthrough Paris Agreement of 2015. Rather than speech acts invoking security, the focus of this analysis is on the socio-scientific discourse of global climate crisis that emerged in the several year period leading to the 2009 {COP} 15 conference in Copenhagen. Two types of expertscontributory and interactionalare identified as the essential and interdependent actors that engaged in crisification', a novel crisis-based perspective on political agenda setting, in which climate crisis served as a primary discursive device employed by prominent advocates of urgent action. Contributory experts, that is, authoritative climate scientists and their institutions, together with interactional expertsnon-scientist social actors who appropriated and mediated scientific data and knowledge in framing climate change as a global crisisconstituted an extended epistemic community of climate advocates. Through an array of speech acts, this extended community effectively co-constructed a convincing climate crisis discourse that consisted of quantitative data artefacts based on {CO}2 concentration and global mean temperature, and qualitative invocations of existential threat to human civilisation, which contributed to the ascent of climate change on the global political agenda. In proposing crisification as a complement to securitisation, the article offers a theoretical innovation that facilitates constructivist analysis of issues framed as crises, including geopolitical problems in certain non-military sectors where crisis is a favoured label for perceived threats to core values.","Paglia, Eric",0,,2110
2151,"Body-image, quality of life and psychological distress: a comparison between kidney transplant patients and a matching healthy sample","The purpose of the current study was to assess the uniqueness of the condition of kidney transplant recipients in comparison to a sample of matching healthy peers in relation to body-image dissatisfaction and identification, quality of life and psychological distress. Participants were 45 kidney transplant recipients who were under follow-up care at a Transplant Unit of a major Medical Center, and a sample of 45 matching healthy peers. Measures were taken using self-report questionnaires [Body-Image Ideals Questionnaire ({BIIQ}), Body Identification Questionnaire ({BIQ}), Brief Symptoms Inventory ({BSI}), and the {SF}-12]. The major findings were the following: (i) kidney transplant recipients reported lower levels of quality of life and higher levels of {PsD} when compared to their healthy peers; (ii) no difference in body-image dissatisfaction was found between the two studied groups; (iii) significant correlations between body-image dissatisfaction quality of life and {PsD} were found only in the kidney transplant recipients. The kidney transplantation condition has a moderating effect in the association between body-image dissatisfaction {PsD} but not in the association between body-image dissatisfaction and quality of life; (iv) kidney transplant recipients experienced higher levels of body identification than did their healthy peers. Taken together, these findings highlight the unique condition of kidney transplant recipients, as well as the function that body-image plays within the self.","Yagil, Yaron and Geller, Shulamit and Levy, Sigal and Sidi, Yael and Aharoni, Shiri",0,,2111
2152,"How Politics Affects Religion: Partisanship, Socialization, and Religiosity in America","Scholars have consistently shown that social identities can shape political attitudes and behaviors; this article explores the reverse relationship. Are partisan identities ever strong enough to influence involvement with a politically relevant social group? Looking at an identity that has become an increasingly strong predictor of partisanship and vote choice, religion, the article develops and tests a theory that politics can affect partisans' levels of religiosity at a certain time in their lives. An experiment and two panel studies show that when people are in the process of raising childrena time that encourages many to make decisions associated with their religious identitiestheir partisanship may influence these religious choices. The findings highlight politics' role in shaping key aspects of partisans' social identities and, ultimately, the religious makeup of the United States.","Margolis, Michele F.",0,,2112
2153,Policies and mechanisms to address climate-induced migration and displacement in Pacific and Caribbean small island developing states,"Purpose - This study aims to assess policies and mechanisms in Caribbean and Pacific small island developing states ({SIDS}) that address climate-induced migration and displacement. The migration of communities away from vulnerable regions is highly likely to be an adaptation strategy used in low-elevation {SIDS}, as the impacts of climate change are likely to result in significant loss and damage, threatening their very territorial existence. {SIDS} must ensure that residents relocate to less vulnerable locations and may need to consider international movement of residents. Ad hoc approaches to migration and displacement may result in increased vulnerability of residents, making the development and enforcement of comprehensive national policies that address these issues a necessity. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ({UNFCCC}) negotiators for {SIDS} as well as analysis of secondary data, including Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, are utilized to determine policies and mechanisms in place that focus on climate-induced migration and displacement. Findings - While climate change is acknowledged as an existential threat, few {SIDS} have policies or mechanisms in place to guide climate-induced migration and displacement. Potential exists for migration and displacement to be included in policies that integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation along with national sustainable development plans. Regional bodies are beneficial to providing guidance to {SIDS} in the development of nationally appropriate frameworks to address climate-induced migration and displacement. Originality/value - Existing gaps in policies and mechanisms and challenges faced by {SIDS} in developing strategies to address climate-induced migration and displacement are explored. Best practices and recommendations for strategies for {SIDS} to address migration and displacement are provided.","Thomas, Adelle and Benjamin, Lisa",0,,2113
2154,{MEASUREMENT} {OF} {EXPLICIT} {AND} {IMPLICIT} {ATTITUDES} {TOWARD} {DEATH},"This research focuses on the measuring of implicit and explicit attitudes towards death. The work has been inspired primarily by the Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) which states that the fear of death is universal. People regard death as a menace and therefore tend to hide the fear in their unconsciousness where it can, however, still influence their behaviour. The thesis is based on previous studies which have shown that explicit and implicit attitudes towards death differ. The majority of existing studies on this topic is based on self-report techniques and there are only a few studies examining the implict attitudes. My research compares results of the Word Association Test (a method measuring implicit attitudes) and the Death Attitude Profile - Revised ({DAP}-R; a method measuring explicit attitudes). The research shows that for a human brain it is more difficult to process words associated with the death than neutral words, but there have not been found any significant correlations between the results of {DAP}-R and the Word Association Test. These findings match with the results of previous researches dealing with this topic.","Cizkova, Anezka and Machu, Klara",0,,2114
2155,Mitigating death anxiety: Identifying music's role in terror management,"Based on the ideas of social-anthropologist Ernest Becker, Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) explains human behavior as being motivated by conscious and unconscious mortality salience. This article examines the role of music in the denial of death and catalogues related literature in the music and social psychology fields. Categories include: {TMT} and art, music used as control condition in {TMT} research, and songs and {TMT}. A brief description of Becker's theory and {TMT} and a discussion of the functions of music in culture precede the literature review. Analysis of the literature suggests that (a) music provides a safe window frame through which to examine death, (b) music created for community purposes may buffer death anxiety more readily than that created for individual purposes, and (c) songs prompt mortality salience and simultaneously buffer death anxiety depending on individual music preferences, cultural worldviews, and perceptions of famous others. The review further identifies limitations in {TMT} studies regarding music and terror management and highlights the need for additional empirical research to untangle the complexity of music's role in mitigating death anxiety growing out of mortality salience.","Cardany, Audrey Berger",0,,2115
2156,5-{HTTLPR} Moderates the Association Between Interdependence and Brain Responses to Mortality Threats,"While behavioral research suggests an association between cultural worldview and decreased anxiety of death, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. Using functional {MRI}, we investigated whether and how the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-{HTTLPR}), which has been associated with mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, moderates the associations between a cultural trait (i.e., interdependence) and self-report of death anxiety/depression and between interdependence and brain responses to mortality threats. Long/long and short/short allele carriers of the 5-{HTTLPR} were scanned using {fMRI} while they performed a one-back task on death-related, death-unrelated negative, and neutral words. Participants' interdependence and death anxiety/depression were assessed using questionnaires after scanning. We found that participants who assessed themselves with greater interdependence reported lower death anxiety/depression and showed decreased neural response to death-related words in emotion-related brain regions including the anterior cingulate, putamen, and thalamus. However, these results were evident in long/long allele carriers of the 5-{HTTLPR} but not in short/short allele carriers who even showed positive associations between interdependence and neural activities in the anterior cingulate, putamen and thalamus in response to death-related words. Our findings suggest candidate mechanisms for explaining the complex relationship between genotype, cultural traits, and mental/neural responses to mortality threats.

2157,Preliminary psychometrics of the Existential Distress Scale in patients with advanced cancer,"Existential distress is of clinical concern in patients with terminal illness. Although existential distress has been used to describe a broad spectrum of psychological disturbances, its narrower definition may be confined to distress that arises when the meaning and value of one's life is unclear, and is comorbid with feelings of loneliness and low self-worth. To promote further study, we developed and pilot-tested a 10-item Existential Distress Scale ({EDS}). Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer were recruited from a palliative care unit. Measures of existential distress, death anxiety, depression, performance status and physical symptom burden were collected. The {EDS} showed promising psychometric properties, including significant associations with death anxiety and depression. Thirty-eight per cent of the sample reported great or unbearable distress on at least one existential concern. The {EDS} may be administered to measure existential distress in patients with advanced cancer and clinicians may find the instrument useful to initiate a structured discussion about this symptom.","Lo, C. and P and ay, T. and Zeppieri, J. and Rydall, A. and Murphy-Kane, P. and Zimmermann, C. and Rodin, G.",0,,2117
2158,Neural Substrates of Context- and Person-Dependent Altruistic Punishment,"Human altruistic behaviors are heterogeneous across both contexts and people, whereas the neural signatures underlying the heterogeneity remain to be elucidated. To address this issue, we examined the neural signatures underlying the context- and person-dependent altruistic punishment, conjoining event-related {fMRI} with both task-based and resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}). Acting as an impartial third party, participants decided how to punish norm violators either alone or in the presence of putative others. We found that the presence of others decreased altruistic punishment due to diffusion of responsibility. Those behavioral effects paralleled altered neural responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}) and putamen. Further, we identified modulation of responsibility diffusion on task-based functional connectivity of {dACC} with the brain regions implicated in reward processing (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala/orbital frontal cortex). Finally, the {RSFC} results revealed that (i) increased intrinsic connectivity strengths of the putamen with temporoparietal junction and dorsolateral {PFC} were associated with attenuated responsibility diffusion in altruistic punishment and (ii) increased putamen-dorsomedial {PFC} connectivity strengths were associated with reduced responsibility diffusion in self-reported responsibility. Taken together, our findings elucidate the context- and person-dependent altruistic behaviors as well as associated neural substrates and thus provide a potential neurocognitive mechanism of heterogeneous human altruistic behaviors.

2159,Death-Related Dimensions of Disability: How Terror Management Theory Can Affect People with Disabilities,"Researchers have promoted a research paradigm that considers dimensions of disability as being integral to understanding and predicting divergent treatment of people with different disabilities. We used a modified policy capture study (N = 225) to assess statistical relationships between established dimensions of disability and the perception of closeness to death. We find that some dimensions of disability (course, peril, risk, origin) are indeed associated with closeness to death. This has important implications because terror management theory posits that people who experience death-related thoughts will become more judgmental and exclusionary toward others. We argue that certain disability dimensions may therefore activate unintentional discriminatory tendencies in others. Practical implications include a different approach to considering and responding to discrimination against people with disabilities. We explain how practitioners can promote egalitarian ideals as a means of channeling the effects of death-related thinking toward outcomes that favor individuals with disabilities.","Sher, Benjamin L. and Wilson, Kimberly J. and Thomas, Adrian and Deuling, Jacqueline K.",0,,2119
2160,Alpha synchronization as a brain model for unconscious defense: An overview of the work of Howard Shevrin and his team,"Howard Shevrin and his team have developed a stringent subliminal priming methodology, which experimentally approximates a situation of an internal, mental triggering of unconscious defense. Through a series of four studies they thus are able to bring evidence for this type of unconscious defense. With event-related potentials, three clinical studies show how synchronization of a specific brain wave, the alpha wave, known for its inhibitory function, is also induced by subliminally presented conflictual subject-specific stimuli. Therefore, alpha synchronization could serve as the brain mechanism of unconscious defense. The results only make sense if we suppose the existence of a dynamic unconscious, which has inherited childhood conflicts, and with privileged connections to neurotic symptom characteristics. Moreover, by showing that the unconscious conflict phrases, inferred by clinicians from clinical interviews, have a similar brain behavior, Shevrin and his team provide evidence that these inferences are not simply clinician-dependent subjective interpretations but also imply some form of independent mental reality. Finally, interpretation of the results has led us to propose two distinct physiological mechanisms for defense: one, unconscious defense, by alpha synchronization in connection with the drive derivatives, and another, repression, based on the indications of reality in connection with the ego.","Bazan, Ariane",0,,2120
2161,Performing Mass Murder: Constructing the Perpetrator in Documentary Film,"The massacre, torture, persecution, and imprisonment of real and imagined communists and sympathizers in mid-1960s Indonesia was among the greatest state-sponsored atrocities of the twentieth century and yet remains little known and even less understood outside Indonesia. An elaborate mythology about the supposed communist coup attempt of September 1965 was foundational to the military government's legitimacy discourses. The dead, the tortured, and the imprisoned remained an existential threat to Indonesia's survival according to these discourses, and yet they could not be spoken of, or acknowledged without fear of retribution from the state. This article explores one attempt to break the silence surrounding the massacres and to make visible the suffering of millions of Indonesians; it does so through an analysis of the documentary film, The Act of Killing, in which a number of those involved in mass murder re-enact their killings. It explores the contribution of the film to understanding the politics of mass murder through an interrogation of the history it purports to address and through the methods employed by filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer. It concludes that while the film is a singular achievement, it fails as a political intervention aimed at deepening understanding of the mass killings.","Philpott, Simon",0,,2121
2162,"Civil Wars \& Transnational Threats: Mapping the Terrain, Assessing the Links","Among the primary strategic rationales for U.S. policy engagement in war-torn states has been the assumption that internal violence generates cross-border spillovers with negative consequences for U.S. and global security, among these transnational terrorism, organized crime, and infectious disease. Closer examination suggests that the connection between internal disorder and transnational threats is situation-specific, contingent on an array of intervening factors and contextual conditions. Taken as a cohort, war-torn states are not the primary drivers of cross-border terrorism, crime, and epidemics, nor do they pose a first-tier, much less existential, threat to the United States. Of greater concern are relatively functional states that maintain certain trappings of sovereignty but are institutionally anemic, thanks to endemic corruption and winner-take-all politics. Ultimately, the most important U.S. stakes in war-torn countries are moral and humanitarian: namely, the imperative of reducing suffering among fellow members of our species.","Patrick, Stewart",0,,2122
2163,Dying for charisma: Leaders' inspirational appeal increases post-mortem,"In the present research, we shed light on the nature and origins of charisma by examining changes in a person's perceived charisma that follow their death. We propose that death is an event that will strengthen the connection between the leader and the group they belong to, which in turn will increase perceptions of leaders' charisma. In Study 1, results from an experimental study show that a scientist who is believed to be dead is regarded as more charismatic than the same scientist believed to be alive. Moreover, this effect was accounted for by people's perceptions that the dead scientist's fate is more strongly connected with the fate of the groups that they represent. In Study 2, a large-scale archival analysis of Heads of States who died in office in the 21st century shows that the proportion of published news items about Heads of State that include references to charisma increases significantly after their. death. These results suggest that charisma is, at least in part, a social inference that increases after death. Moreover, they suggest that social influence and inspiration can be understood as products of people's capacity to embody valued social groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

2164,Anxiety in the context of cancer: A systematic review and development of an integrated model,"Anxiety is common in the context of cancer, but there are few theoretical models that apply to people with cancer across the trajectory of their illness. The aims of this review are to identify existing theories and to propose an integrated model of cancer-related anxiety. Using a systematic literature search of Medline, Premedline and {PsycINFO} databases, we identified nine theoretical models of anxiety in the context of cancer. We reviewed these for psychological concepts that fell under five themes: pre-existing schema, the inherent nature of cancer, cognitive factors, coping responses and contextual factors. From these themes, we integrated concepts from different models to develop a theoretical framework to explain the development and maintenance of anxiety in the context of cancer. The resulting model suggests that pre-existing schema, past experiences of cancer, an intolerance of uncertainty and meta-cognitive beliefs about worry interact with the inherent nature of cancer to produce overwhelming distress. The distress activates cognitive processes characterized by vigilance, worry and rumination. Attempts to cope by re-establishing control, and a pattern of vigilance to cancer-related cues and/or avoidance reinforce anxiety, in the context of a range of systemic factors that can either buffer against or worsen the anxiety.","Curran, Leah and Sharpe, Louise and Butow, Phyllis",0,,2124
2165,Activating analytic thinking enhances the value given to individualizing moral foundations,"Two central debates within Moral Foundations Theory concern (1) which moral foundations are core and (2) how conflict between ideological camps stemming from valuing different moral foundations can be resolved. Previous studies have attempted to answer the first question by imposing cognitive load on participants to direct them toward intuitive and automatic thought. However, this method has limitations and has produced mixed findings. In the present research, in two experiments, instead of directing participants toward intuitive thought, we tested the effects of activating high-effort, analytic thought on participants' moral foundations. In both experiments, analytic thought activation caused participants to value individualizing foundations greater than the control condition. This effect was not qualified by participants' political orientation. No effect was observed on binding foundations. The results are consistent with the idea that upholding individualizing foundations requires mental effort and may provide the basis for reconciliation between different ideological camps.

2166,The art of constructing (in)security: probing rhetorical strategies of securitisation,"Scholars advocating a sociological view of securitisation have criticised the Copenhagen school for its overemphasis on the grammar of security and its neglect of the social situat-edness of securitisation. Accordingly, these critics have also pointed to the relevance of rhetorical strategy, that is, how agents tailor their securitising moves to specific audiences and contexts. This article advances our knowledge of rhetorical strategies of securitisation in two ways. First, it introduces the four rhetorical appeals of authority, fidelity, presence, and emotionality as text-level factors that facilitate the success of securitising moves. Second, the article focuses on rhetorical assemblage and argues that narrative theory enables us to gain a nuanced understanding of how securitising actors seek to create the four rhetorical appeals by selecting and combining discursive resources. To illustrate the added value of this theoretical framework, I use the documentary movies Countdown to Zero and Nuclear Tipping Point. These documentaries are securitising moves that seek to persuade a public audience in the United States of the existential threat that nuclear weapons pose and to mobilise this audience to support the cause of disarmament.","Senn, Martin",0,,2126
2167,Introduction: Interpreting Communal Violence in Myanmar,"Collective violence wracked Myanmar from 2012 to 2014. Overwhelmingly, Buddhists attacked Muslims. This article categorises the violence as communal, in so far as it consisted of recurrent, sporadic, direct physical hostility realised through repeated public expressions that Muslims constitute an existential threat to Buddhists. It advocates for interpretive modes of inquiry into the violence, as well as into the practices of interpretation enabling it. Eschewing methods aimed at producing a purportedly coherent picture of what happened, interpretive research raises questions about conventional readings of violence, and seemingly self-evident categories for its analysis. But as the articles in this special issue show, interpretivists do not repudiate the search for factual truth. The contributors all make strong truth claims, but claims recognising that factual truths are always contingent. They establish these claims by attending variously to the processes, narratives, histories and typologies that have contributed to the production of communal violence in Myanmar.","Cheesman, Nick",0,,2127
2168,The Contentious Politics of Anti-Muslim Scapegoating in Myanmar,"Recent anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar cannot be understood primarily as a spontaneous outburst of religious feeling among the general population. Rather it was a shocking repertoire deployed by a semi-organised social movement with clear political goals, which overlapped with those of Myanmar's military elite. In this article we trace the history of contention that saw key collective actors emerge who staged violent events and then framed them for the public. Elite competitive strategies leading to the 2015 election shaped its rhythm. A new regional player, the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party, initiated the violence. When the ruling elite failed to condemn it, a monk-led, apparently popular, chauvinistic movement expanded rapidly throughout Myanmar. Asserting the Rakhine violence as an existential threat to the Burmese nation, a moral panic effectively created a crisis where none existed. The movement then routinised itself into a de facto pro-regime, anti-National League for Democracy, theocratic political party favouring President Thein Sein's re-election. While maintaining broad ties (but not chains of command) to military elites, it enjoyed a degree of autonomy not seen before under military rule. It ultimately failed to influence voter behaviour significantly, but the new salience of anti-Muslim chauvinism portends future conflict in the fledgling democracy.","van Klinken, Gerry and Aung, Su Mon Thazin",0,,2128
2169,"Reconciling Contradictions: Buddhist-Muslim Violence, Narrative Making and Memory in Myanmar","Myanmar has been the site of serious violence between Buddhist and Muslim communities. This article presents findings from a research project convened to better understand the production of this violence. Based on interviews with 78 residents of six cities, we find a narrative that presents Islam in general and Muslims in Myanmar as an existential threat to race and religion and a personal threat to individuals and communities. This narrative is reinforced by three inter-related sets of arguments that refer to international events, events within Myanmar, and personal experiences. Drawing on these findings, we explore the ways in which Muslims in Myanmar are constructed as a fearsome Other, thus justifying discrimination and violence. However, we also identify alternative narratives that contest the production of violence. These narratives are generated through articulated senses of contradiction between contemporary antagonisms and memories of inter-religious co-existence. We argue that understanding these narratives is one necessary part of much larger efforts to promote peace and reconciliation.","Schissler, Matt and Walton, Matthew J. and Thi, Phyu Phyu",0,,2129
2170,"Disputed Subjects of Paris Climate Agreement, 2015","Evolution and effectiveness of an international climate change regime to address impacts of global climate change demand understanding complexity of the underlying political and economic underpinnings of the problem. This article explores disputed subjects of Paris Climate Agreement, 2015 that largely restrain cooperation among sovereign states from devising effective internationally determined and legally binding commitments. Rich states are understood historically responsible for the problem for their earlier industrialization; poor developing states are significantly suffering from the worst negative consequences of climate change. Similarly, climate actions in terms of mitigation demand reduced use of fossil fuels, an economic threat to primarily fossil fuels based economies, a compromise on the highly consumptive societies and a constrain on growing developing economies. On the other hand, climate inaction in terms of mitigation and adaptation poses grave repercussion to developing states, rather existential threat to vulnerable small islands and low-lying states.","Khan, Zahoor",0,,2130
2171,Effect of media presentations on willingness to commit to organ donation,"We examine how presentations of organ donation cases in the media may affect people's willingness to sign organ donation commitment cards, donate the organs of a deceased relative, support the transition to an ""opt-out"" policy, or donate a kidney while alive. We found that providing identifying information about the prospective recipient (whose life was saved by the donation) increased the participants' willingness to commit to organ donation themselves, donate the organs of a deceased relative, or support a transition to an ""opt-out"" policy. Conversely, identifying the deceased donor tended to induce thoughts of death rather than about saving lives, resulting in fewer participants willing to donate organs or support measures that facilitated organ donation. A study of online news revealed that identification of the donor is significantly more common than identification of the recipient in the coverage of organ donation cases-with possibly adverse effects on the incidence of organ donations.","Harel, Inbal and Kogut, Tehila and Pinchas, Meir and Slovic, Paul",0,,2131
2172,Long-term demography of the Northern Goshawk in a variable environment,"The Nearctic northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillis) is a resident of conifer, broadleaf, and mixed forests from the boreal to the southwestern montane regions of North America. We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991-2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change () of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, {USA}. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87\% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8km between territory centers in a 1,728-km(2) study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8\% to 86\% (x=37\%, {SE}=4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12\% to 48\% (overall x=23\%, {SE}=2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged 1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x=2.0 young, {SE}=0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992-1993, 77-87\% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Nino-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8\% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83\% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53\% M; n=410M, 366F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43\% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999-2010), an estimated 46\% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54\% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes. Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged 4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of for breeding adults (M, 0.94, {SE}=0.037; F, 0.98, {SE}=0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age+sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53\%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945ha during our study and killed most ({\textgreater}64\%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire.

2173,The Rise of Pan-Islamic Terrorism in Africa: A Global Security Challenge,"Although the vast majority of Africans are peaceful moderates, radical Islamic ideology that fuels pan-Islamic terrorism is on the rise in the continent because of factors that can be categorized under push and pull forces. The push forces are conditions that drive people to embrace the ideology of violent jihad. These involve: local backlash against Americanization/globalization; authoritarian/oppressive political systems; lack of basic human rights; youth bulge/high unemployment; corruption/lack of meritocracy, state collapse; and porous borders. The pull factors are the advantages terrorist/jihadi movements have that attract people to their cause. These include: radical Islamic ideology; humanitarian networks; media propaganda; provision of a purpose and mission; the lure of martyrdom and influences of Madrassas. I argue these factors create global security challenges: an existential threat to the Westphalian state system; the creation of terror-safe havens; displacement and mass global migration; massive global civilian casualties; and a conflict resolution conundrum.","Antwi-Boateng, Osman",0,,2133
2174,Religious beliefs are factual beliefs: Content does not correlate with context sensitivity,"Neil Van Leeuwen argues that religious beliefs are not factual beliefs: typically, at least, they are attitudes of a different type. He argues that they exhibit much more sensitivity to context than factual beliefs: outside of contexts in which they are salient, they do not govern behavidur or inference, or provide background assumptions for cognition. This article surveys a large range of data to show that the kind of context sensitivity that Van Leeuwen thinks is the province of religious beliefs does not correlate with belief content. Beliefs about matters of fact beyond the theological realm exhibit this kind of sensitivity too. Conversely, theological and supernatural beliefs often guide behaviour across contexts. It is the intuitiveness of representations across contexts that predicts context (in)sensitivity, and intuitiveness is powerfully influenced by processing fluency. Fluency, in turn, is sensitive to cues that vary across contexts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Levy, Neil",0,,2134
2175,The evolution of extreme cooperation via shared dysphoric experiences!,"Willingness to lay down one's life for a group of non-kin, well documented historically and ethnographically, represents an evolutionary puzzle. Building on research in social psychology, we develop a mathematical model showing how conditioning cooperation on previous shared experience can allow individually costly pro-group behavior to evolve. The model generates a series of predictions that we then test empirically in a range of special sample populations (including military veterans, college fraternity/sorority members, football fans, martial arts practitioners, and twins). Our empirical results show that sharing painful experiences produces ""identity fusion"" -a visceral sense of oneness which in turn can motivate self-sacrifice, including willingness to fight and die for the group. Practically, our account of how shared dysphoric experiences produce identity fusion helps us better understand such pressing social issues as suicide terrorism, holy wars, sectarian violence, gang-related violence, and other forms of intergroup conflict.","Whitehouse, Harvey and Jong, Jonathan and Buhrmester, Michael D. and Gomez, Angel and Bastian, Brock and Kavanagh, Christopher M. and Newson, Martha and Matthews, Miriam and Lanman, Jonathan A. and Mckay, Ryan and Gavrilets, Sergey",0,,2135
2176,Water (in)security in Canada: national identity and the exclusion of Indigenous peoples,"With the exception of First Nations, Metis, and Inuit people, most Canadians enjoy water security. Indigenous people are ninety times more likely than other Canadians to lack piped water. These disparities result from and maintain the colonial relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples. As displaced people with values often in opposition to neo-liberalism, Indigenous people present an existential threat to Canadian identity, this identity having been created around possession of a vast land that extends to the North Pole, and subsequent heavy resource extraction throughout this land. To maintain Canada's national identity and the activities that support it, Indigenous people have to be pushed to the figurative and literal fringes and rendered invisible. Five short case studies of water insecurity demonstrate how neo-liberalism props up and legitimises decentralised water governance in Canada, which in turn promotes and maintains environmental inequality, Indigenous marginalisation and, ultimately, the Canadian identity.","Hanrahan, Maura",0,,2136

Both interventions focused on engaging patients in consultations, responding to emotions, informing patients about prognosis and treatment choices, and balanced framing of information. Control participants received no training. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} The prespecified primary outcome was a composite measure of patient-centered communication coded from audio recordings of the first oncologist visit following patient coaching (intervention group) or enrollment (control). Secondary outcomes included the patient-physician relationship, shared understanding of prognosis, {QOL}, and aggressive treatments and hospice use in the last 30 days of life. {RESULTS} Data from 38 oncologists (19 randomized to intervention) and 265 patients (130 intervention) were analyzed. In fully adjusted models, the intervention resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in the primary physician-patient communication end point (adjusted intervention effect, 0.34; 95\% {CI}, 0.06-0.62; P = .02). Differences in secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} A combined intervention that included oncologist communication training and coaching for patients with advanced cancer was effective in improving patient-centered communication but did not affect secondary outcomes.","Epstein, Ronald M. and Duberstein, Paul R. and Fenton, Joshua J. and Fiscella, Kevin and Hoerger, Michael and Tancredi, Daniel J. and Xing, Guibo and Gramling, Robert and Mohile, Supriya and Franks, Peter and Kaesberg, Paul and Plumb, S and y and Cipri, Camille S. and Street, Richard L. and Shields, Clevel and G. and Back, Anthony L. and Butow, Phyllis and Walczak, Adam and Tattersall, Martin and Venuti, Alison and Sullivan, Peter and Robinson, Mark and Hoh, Beth and Lewis, Linda and Kravitz, Richard L.",0,,2137
2178,"""{NUCLEAR} {CONSUMED} {LOVE}"": atomic threats and australian indigenous activist poetics","This essay will examine the polemic and poetic means through which three Indigenous Australian writers discuss the repercussions and risks associated with nuclear power, waste and weaponry as an existential and material threat to the mythopoeic creation stories, totemic systems and landforms which sustain Indigenous Australian belief. This essay will follow the establishment of a media ecology through which discourses of technological harm in Oodgeroo Noonuccal's No More Boomerang lay the foundation for Australian Indigenous anti-nuclear activist poetics and highlights the relationship between language, belief and technology. Oodgeroo's [Kath Walker] No More Boomerang will be read as a precursor to the experimental expression of Lionel Fogarty's Foot Walking and Talking - Atomic Confusion as well as the procedural methodologies behind Natalie Harkin's Zero Tolerance. It will be argued that Indigenous-led representations of nuclear weaponry as an ontologic-existential threat can only be properly critiqued when framed through the constructs of race, nationhood and the history of colonization in Australia.","Hall, Matthew",0,,2138

Or does disaster lie in refusing to engage the jurisgenerative potential of courts in a domain of such vast significance? This Article examines global climate change adjudication to shed light on these questions, focusing particularly on cases that seek to invoke the norm articulation and enforcement functions of courts. The attempt to configure climate-related harms within such substantive frameworks as tort and constitutional law is fraught with analytical and practical difficulties. Yet the exercise, we argue, is essential. Against the backdrop of a potentially existential threat, judges redeem the very possibility of law when they forthrightly confront the merits of climate lawsuits. Conversely, when they use weak preliminary and procedural maneuvers to avoid such confrontation, judges reinforce a sense of law's disappearance into the maw of normative rupture.","Weaver, R.

2180,Causes of the {US} Hostage Crisis in Iran: The Untold Account of the Communist Threat,"This article provides a revisionist account of the occupation of the {US} embassy in Tehran in November 1979, one of the most conspicuous manifestations of anti-Americanism in recent history. Drawing solely upon primary documents, largely from various Iranian communists and Islamists, it questions the conventional wisdom that the Islamists' takeover of the embassy was a grassroots reaction to American policies, particularly after President Carter admitted the ailing Shah. It also challenges the argument that the radical students stormed the embassy primarily to bring down the nationalist provisional government. Instead, I introduce a critical overlooked factor and argue that the Hostage Crisis can be better explained as a preemptive act by the Islamists to outbid the leftists' anti-American activities. I demonstrate that the United States and the Islamists were seeking to maintain normal relations during and even after the 1979 revolution. However, various communist organizations that surfaced after the revolution posed an existential threat to the new Islamist-nationalist government, quickly dominating universities, labor unions, and intellectual circles throughout the country and accusing the Islamists and their nationalist allies of collaborating with the United States. In this climate, the Islamists strategically adopted the Left's anti-imperialist language and eventually occupied the {US} embassy to establish their anti-American credibility.","Tabaar, Mohammad Ayatollahi",0,,2140

But journalists and academics have decried the practice, arguing that the implementation of such extraordinary provisions may lead to a slippery slope. As the first study to investigate empirically the relationship between online surveillance and support for other extraordinary measures to prevent terrorism, we find that perceptions of government monitoring lead to increased support for hawkish foreign policy through value-conflict associations in memory that prompt a suppression of others' online and offline civil liberties, including rights to free speech and a fair trial. Implications for the privacy-security debate are discussed.","Stoycheff, Elizabeth and Wibowo, Kunto A. and Liu, Juan and Xu, Kai",0,,2141

Findings - This detailed examination leads to rejection of ergodicity and concludes that the existing social contract is unrealizable and unsustainable in present form for all but a shrinking minority of citizens. Research limitations/implications - The conclusion is robust but tentative since the trends reviewed are not fixed and may deviate from existing trend lines given undetermined government policies and unforeseeable technological developments. Originality/value - The paper examines the origins and implications of six adverse systemic trends, highlighting the fact that existing policy prescriptions lack understanding of - and/or scale to comprehensively address - a growing existential threat to the Liberal Tradition's entrenched social contract.","Taylor, Kenneth Bruce",0,,2142

2184,Prosocial behavior following immortality priming: experimental tests of factors with implications for {CVE} interventions,"As the field of countering violent extremism ({CVE}) evolves, increased emphasis has been placed on the development of interventions intended to be individually tailored to the needs of intervention program participants. Despite such emphasis, there is scant empirical research, much less experimental research, regarding psychological mechanisms that either bolster, or hinder, the effectiveness of such interventions. The present study experimentally tested two factors, in addition to accounting for a third, for their effects on an outcome potentially germane to a wide range of tailored {CVE} interventions: participants' voluntary, unsupervised behavior toward out-group members. Specifically, based upon Terror Management Theory, the present study answered the following questions. (1) Might priming individuals with notions of immortality (vs. controls) tend to cause them to increase their generosity and decrease their in-group bias, as demonstrated in a behavioral outcome (monetary donations)? (2) If so, is that effect positively associated with individuals' level of collectivism? (3) Might individuals react differently to immortality primes, based on whether they are spiritual believers vs. nonbelievers? Specifically, might believers -whose meaning system presumably has not been threatened by such primes -tend to demonstrate, a greater reduction of in-group bias? Immortality priming did not significantly reduce in-group bias. However, it strongly interacted with spiritual beliefs such that spiritual believers gave more when primed with immortality. Collectivism was positively associated with donations, which tended to be more generous both when individuals gave to racial in-group members, and among donors who were unbelievers. Applications for individually tailored interventions for {CVE} are discussed.","Williams, Michael J.",0,,2144
2185,{DISTRESSFUL} {EMPATHY} {IN} {READING} {LITERATURE}: {THE} {CASE} {FOR} {TERROR} {MANAGEMENT} {THEORY}?,"This article investigates the extent to which predictions of Terror Management Theory also hold on reading literature. Indeed, death is ubiquitous in fiction. But does reading about it cause the same reactions as those predicted by Terror Management Theory? To answer this question, five reading experiments were carried out. The hypothesis, developed in the framework of Terror Management Theory, that direct confrontation with one's mortality strengthens both prejudices against outsiders and enhances in-group values, was tested. Contrary to initial expectations, the results did not confirm the predictions, casting a shadow over the hypothesis of distressful empathy. This raises the question whether mortality salience in literary texts is different from other such confrontations. This leads us to the question why people indulge in such distressful emotions. It will be argued that confrontation with death in literature may actually relieve the tension produced by mortality reminders. This perspective may be linked to Aristotle's notion of catharsis.","van Peer, Willie and Chesnokova, Anna and Springer, Matthias",0,,2145
2186,Factors behind support for harsher punishments for common and uncommon offenders,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore individual factors predicting support for harsher punishments for relatively common and uncommon serious offenders. Design/methodology/approach - In Study 1, 120 {UK} participants (60 males and 60 females; mean age = 37.31 {SD} = 16.74) completed a survey exploring the extent to which they supported harsher punishments ({SHP}) for first time and repeat fraud, sexual and violent offenders. In Study 2, 131 participants (70 Britons and 61 Singaporeans; 69 females and 62 males; mean age = 31.57; {SD} = 10.87) completed a similar survey exploring their support for life sentence without the possibility of parole ({SLSWP}) for rather uncommon repeat offenders (i.e. drug traffickers, human traffickers, serious sexual offenders). Findings - Study 1 found that right-wing authoritarianism ({RWA}) was an {SHP} predictor for first time and repeat fraud, violent and sex offenders. Study 2 found that national identity (i.e. how British or Singaporean participants felt) played a similar role to Study 1's {RWA} in being a positive {SLSWP} predictor for repeat human traffickers and drug traffickers of both sexes, as well as male sex offenders. In contrast to the hypothesis, however, participants' locations did not appear to play a statistically significant role. Research limitations/implications - This survey-based research reveals a nuanced and quite consistent picture that could benefit from the inclusion of socio-economic factors and other cross-cultural comparisons. Practical implications - The key message from this study is to inform the public on the role that right-wing authoritarianism and national identity play in their {SHP} and {SLSWP}. Social implications - It is vital to increase the legislators' and the public awareness of the role that national identity and {RWA} seem to play. Originality/value - The paper offers insight into factors behind people's punitive attitudes towards specific crimes regardless of geo-cultural location.","Palasinski, Marek and Shortl and , Neil",0,,2146
2187,"Wounded Detachments: Cronulla, Social Memory and the Injuries of Racism","More than a decade since the Cronulla Riots, it could be argued that we are none the wiser about what they meant. Frequently evoked in public discourse, 'Cronulla' has become a benchmark for the worst of Australian society (whether that is seen as racism or multiculturalism). This paper reflects upon the representation of the Riots to explore three key ideas. First, we need to think about Cronulla through an exploration of the situated processes of social memory. There is no single meaning' of the Riots. In fact, the symbolic place of 'Cronulla' in public discourse is a contested space in which competing interests, processes and perspectives are at stake. Second, social memory is a complex and dispersed architecture of remembering and forgetting, but analysis typically focuses on the institutional and collective dimensions of social memory at the expense of other domains. Third, and drawing on some of the theoretical literature, we explore a different kind of memory that is forgotten in political and media representations of Cronulla - the embodied memory resulting from the injuries of racism experienced by those of Middle Eastern background. We see Cronulla entailing a violent and existential threat which detaches them from full belonging in Australia.","Noble, Greg and Tabar, Paul",0,,2147

I analyze speech acts to show how moves to securitize {SMV} spread from the political fringe to the center of power, and from individual sectors to the strategic level. This moral turn in Russian politics is not merely a superficial attempt of the elite to distract the masses and rally the conservative electorate. The securitization of {SMV} has wider implications: It is, in the most direct way, the regime's way of preventing a color revolution. By introducing a state of siege to the sphere of fundamental moral values, this securitization aids the construction of a national identity that is incompatible with basic human rights. An existential threat is constructed in order to justify extraordinary measures and establish a new social contract in which modernization is sacrificed at the altar of security.","Ostbo, Jardar",0,,2148

In The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology and behavioral science, (Vol 3, 4th ed. pp. 977-979). Hokoben, {NJ}: John Wiley \& Sons] assumes that animates (e.g., baby, rabbit presented as words or pictures) are better remembered than inanimates (e.g., bottle, mountain) because animates are more important for fitness than inanimates. In four studies, we investigated whether the animacy effect in episodic memory (i.e., the better remembering of animates over inanimates) is independent of encoding instructions. Using both a factorial (Studies 1 and 3) and a multiple regression approach (Study 2), three studies tested whether certain contexts drive people to attend to inanimate more than to animate things (or the reverse), and therefore lead to differential animacy effects. The findings showed that animacy effects on recall performance were observed in the grassland-survival scenario used by Nairne, Thompson, and Pandeirada (2007. Adaptive memory: Survival processing enhances retention. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, \& Cognition, 33, 263-273) (Studies 1-3), when words were rated for their pleasantness (Study 2), and in explicit learning (Study 3). In the non-survival scenario of moving to a foreign land (Studies 1-2), animacy effects on recall rates were not reliable in Study 1, but were significant in Study 2, whereas these effects were reliable in the non-survival scenario of planning a trip as a tour guide (Study 3). A final (control) study (Study 4) was conducted to test specifically whether animacy effects are related to the more organised nature of animates than inanimates. Overall, the findings suggest that animacy effects are robust since they do not vary across different sets of encoding instructions (e.g., encoding for survival, preparing a trip and pleasantness).","Gelin, Margaux and Bugaiska, Aurelia and Meot, Alain and Bonin, Patrick",0,,2149
2190,"Mortality awareness and water decisions: a social psychological analysis of supply-management, demand-management and soft-path paradigms","The beliefs underlying the water supply-management, demand-management, and soft-path paradigms are examined. Two questions are considered. First, can social psychology's insights on mortality salience help explain the desire to control water and the dominant water supply-management paradigm? Second, can those insights also help explain the limited progress of demand management and water soft paths? We propose that mortality salience helps explain why individuals and societies seek to control water supply and, by extension, deny their connection to nature and limit consciousness of physical vulnerability. We briefly consider the implications of this perspective for water research, advocacy and policy.","Wolfe, S. E. and Brooks, David B.",0,,2150
2192,Cracking open death: death conversations in primary care,"{INTRODUCTION}: Research supports talking about death outside the end-of-life context. Benefits include allaying death anxiety to increased engagement in health promotion interventions. Nonetheless, the focus on death conversations remains centred on the imminently dying. This qualitative study investigated New Zealanders' perspectives on the value of, opportunities for, and barriers to death conversations in primary healthcare. {METHODS}: Twenty-one participants were interviewed. Participants were young older adults (54-65 years) not receiving palliative care or diagnosed with a terminal illness. Most were women who identified ethnically as New Zealand European. An immersion crystallisation approach to thematic development was used to accommodate the multidisciplinary research framework. {RESULTS}: Four core themes were identified: 'a need to talk about death'; 'the role of the {GP}'; `broaching the topic'; and 'media'. {CONCLUSION}: A cultural silence on death has rendered both the medical and lay community insufficiently prepared for frank and meaningful engagement with the topic, exacerbated by restricted consultation timeframes. The ease of death conversations may be facilitated by taking a family-centred approach, using community organisations and settings, and harnessing conversation entry points provided by the media. Future research should aim to develop tailored resources and frameworks to support general practitioners' meaningful engagement with the topic of death both within and outside of the end-of-life context.","Llewellyn, Rebecca and Jaye, Chrystal and Egan, Richard and Cunningham, Wayne and Young, Jessica and Radue, Peter",0,,2151
2193,The Physicalist Worldview as Neurotic Ego-Defense Mechanism,"The physicalist worldview is often portrayed as a dispassionate interpretation of reality motivated purely by observable facts. In this article, ideas of both depth and social psychology are used to show that this portrayal may not be accurate. Physicalism-whether it ultimately turns out to be philosophically correct or not-is hypothesized to be partly motivated by the neurotic endeavor to project onto the world attributes that help one avoid confronting unacknowledged aspects of one's own inner life. Moreover, contrary to what most people assume, physicalism creates an opportunity for the intellectual elites who develop and promote it to maintain a sense of meaning in their own lives through fluid compensation. However, because this compensatory strategy does not apply to a large segment of society, it creates a schism-with corresponding tensions-that may help explain the contemporary conflict between neo-atheism and religious belief.","Kastrup, Bernardo",0,,2152
2194,Testimonial injustice and prescriptive credibility deficits,"In light of recent social psychological literature, I expand Miranda Fricker's important notion of testimonial injustice. A fair portion of Fricker's account rests on an older paradigm of stereotype and prejudice. Given recent empirical work, I argue for what I dub prescriptive credibility deficits in which a backlash effect leads to the assignment of a diminished level of credibility to persons who act in counter-stereotypic manners, thereby flouting prescriptive stereotypes. The notion of a prescriptive credibility deficit is not merely an interesting conceptual addendum that can be appended to Fricker's theory without need for further emendation. I develop the wider implications of prescriptive credibility deficits and argue that they pose a challenge to Fricker's conception of (1) the function of credibility assignments in conversational exchange and (2) how a virtuous listener should respond to the potential threat of a prejudicial stereotype affecting her credibility assignments.","Munroe, Wade",0,,2153
2195,Death and Turnout: The Human Costs of War and Voter Participation in Democracies,"War heightens public interest in politics, especially when human lives are lost. We examine whether, and how, combat casualties affect the decision to vote in established democracies. Drawing from social psychology research on mortality salience, we expect increasing casualties to increase the salience of death, information that moves people to defend their worldview, especially nationalistic and ideological values. By heightening the importance of values, we propose that combat casualties increase the benefits of voting. In particular, we expect the effect of combat casualties to be pronounced among the least politically engaged. Using both cross-national data of elections in 23 democracies over a 50-year period and survey data from the United States and United Kingdom during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, we found that mounting casualties increase turnout. Furthermore, as expected, we found the effect of casualties to be most pronounced among those least interested in politics.","Koch, Michael T. and Nicholson, Stephen P.",0,,2154
2196,Active and adaptive Legionella {CRISPR}-Cas reveals a recurrent challenge to the pathogen,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with {CRISPR}-associated gene ({CRISPR}-Cas) systems are widely recognized as critical genome defense systems that protect microbes from external threats such as bacteriophage infection. Several isolates of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila possess multiple {CRISPR}-Cas systems (type I-C, type I-F and type {II}-B), yet the targets of these systems remain unknown. With the recent observation that at least one of these systems ({II}-B) plays a non-canonical role in supporting intracellular replication, the possibility remained that these systems are vestigial genome defense systems co-opted for other purposes. Our data indicate that this is not the case. Using an established plasmid transformation assay, we demonstrate that type I-C, I-F and {II}-B {CRISPR}-Cas provide protection against spacer targets. We observe efficient laboratory acquisition of new spacers under priming' conditions, in which initially incomplete target elimination leads to the generation of new spacers and ultimate loss of the invasive {DNA}. Critically, we identify the first known target of L. pneumophila {CRISPR}-Cas: a 30kb episome of unknown function whose interbacterial transfer is guarded against by {CRISPR}-Cas. We provide evidence that the element can subvert {CRISPR}-Cas by mutating its targeted sequences - but that primed spacer acquisition may limit this mechanism of escape. Rather than generally impinging on bacterial fitness, this element drives a host specialization event - with improved fitness in Acanthamoeba but a reduced ability to replicate in other hosts and conditions. These observations add to a growing body of evidence that host range restriction can serve as an existential threat to L. pneumophila in the wild.","Rao, Chitong and Guyard, Cyril and Pelaz, Carmen and Wasserscheid, Jessica and Bondy-Denomy, Joseph and Dewar, Ken and Ensminger, Alex and er W.",0,,2155
2197,The meaning of self-reported death anxiety in advanced cancer,"Background: Death anxiety is important but understudied in palliative care. New self-report measurements have been developed, but their interpretation and clinical utility may not be evident. Aim: To inform our understanding of death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer by exploring the relationship between this self reported symptom and its clinical presentation. Design: Participants were part of a psychotherapy trial in advanced cancer. First therapy session transcripts were analyzed using interpretive description in patients reporting low, moderate, and high death anxiety on the Death and Dying Distress Scale ({DADDS}). Setting/participants: A total of 16 participants (10 women and 6 men) with advanced or metastatic cancer were sampled from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. Six participants reported low death anxiety scores (Death and Dying Distress Scale: 0-19), five moderate (Death and Dying Distress Scale: 20-50), and five high (Death and Dying Distress Scale: 51-75). Results: The low death anxiety group exhibited psychological readiness for death, or contrastingly, non-reflectiveness about death. The moderate group recognized the imminence of mortality, which impacted treatment decisions and future plans. Prior experience with death was discussed as raising the salience of mortality. The high group felt dominated by powerful emotions and could not make sense of their situation. Their distress was exacerbated by substantial relational concerns. Conclusion: Self-reported death anxiety is affected by the awareness and ability to reflect on mortality. Death and Dying Distress Scale scores may facilitate exploration of this symptom as part of a clinical assessment and may serve to guide treatment approaches. Greater attention to death anxiety is consistent with and recommended by contemporary approaches to palliative care.","Tong, Eryn and Deckert, Amy and Gani, Nina and Nissim, Rinat and Rydall, Anne and Hales, Sarah and Rodin, Gary and Lo, Chris",0,,2156
2198,Gezi park protests in Turkey: how can death be related to the protests?,"The aim of the paper is to investigate the Gezi Park Protests in Turkey from the perspective of terror management theory ({TMT}). The Gezi Park Protests started at the end of May 2013 to defend the destruction of a small park. The protests started with environmentalist reactions and acquired a political nature afterwards. The roles of social media and humour are also discussed in relation to the different dimensions of the Gezi Park Protests. {TMT}, more specifically the mortality salience hypothesis, is used to explain these protests, since they include both the concrete and abstract forms of mortality. The concrete forms of death were the death of trees and the death of protesters themselves. The abstract forms of death, on the other hand, were the death of lifestyle from the protesters' perspective and death of exercise power from the government's side. Three necessary conditions for an alternative experimental manipulation in {TMT} studies are discussed in relation to the Gezi Park Protests.

2199,"'{THE} {NIGHT} {WAR} {OF} {NAMPULA}': {VULNERABLE} {CHILDREN}, {SOCIAL} {CHANGE} {AND} {SPIRITUAL} {INSECURITY} {IN} {NORTHERN} {MOZAMBIQUE}","People living in the neighbourhoods of Nampula city, northern Mozambique, often speak of a war that is being waged at night, during which sick infants and small children figure more and more frequently as the preferred prey of malevolent ancestors, witches and new malign spirits that come at night, and who abduct and enslave them in order to harm their families. The purpose of this article is to explore what this 'war of the night' reveals, to understand why it is that mothers are afraid their babies and children will be stolen from the compound and, finally, to analyse the ways in which families handle their fears and apprehensions about a child's sickness. I begin this analysis of the 'war of the night', and the accompanying anxieties surrounding infants and children, by examining it in relation to large-scale changes that have occurred both at the micro-level of the household and in the community more generally. Specifically, the article looks at the ways in which ongoing economic and social transformations are reconfiguring gender and generational relationships, which, in turn, generates more insecurity within the household and intensifies a sense of existential threat from external forces. The article then examines the cultural logic of rumours and beliefs involving children, as a consideration of local interpretations and experiences of infancy and childhood helps shed light on local concepts of (children's) vulnerability. With the aid of three case studies, the article charts how families manage children's diseases. It shows how the uncertainty surrounding an illness is not always ameliorated by divinations or by the healing provided by women working on behalf of ancestral power. Instead, women healers often crystallize and intensify mothers' fears, also because their medical and ritual interventions are not always effective. The article concludes by examining the reasons why these women healers are increasingly struggling to manage the evil forces haunting infants and children and to make their medical interventions effective, and the effect of this on their local authority.","Trentini, Daria",0,,2158
2200,Mapping the Minds of Suicide Bombers using Linguistic Methods: The Corpus of Palestinian Suicide Bombers' Farewell Letters ({CoPSBFL}),"This study proposes a novel methodology for the study of the mindset, motives, and cognitive style of individual suicide bombers in Israel/Palestine, based on a comprehensive corpus of personal farewell letters (which also serve as last wills) that were written by suicide bombers to their family during the Second Intifada (2000-2006). To avoid privileging certain a priori sentiments, motivations, or concepts over others, I used a programmatic bottom-up sequence of quantitative psycholinguistic procedures, in which prominent themes or concepts from one level of analysis are further qualified and contextualized in the next. This afforded a minimally biased view of the cognitive content of Palestinian suicide bombers, including the sentiments, motivations, and concepts that they were more preoccupied with, and the context in which these ideas were expressed. The results are largely consistent with theories of political violence that place pro-social sentiments at the forefront of the motivations for suicide terrorism, and paramount to antisocial sentiments such as hatred and revenge. Since the linguistic patterns that were uncovered in this analysis cannot be controlled consciously, and the farewell letters of suicide bombers have rarely been rigorously analyzed linguistically, this study may provide an unprecedented glimpse into the cognitive style and content of individual suicide bombersa glimpse that is minimally biased by political, partisan, or sectarian preconceptions.","Cohen, Shuki J.",0,,2159
2201,Securitization Climax: Putting the Iranian Nuclear Project at the Top of the Israeli Public Agenda (2009-2012)(1),"What happens to a securitized issue over time? In many cases, the issue goes through a process of desecuritization and ceases to be an existential threat. But in some cases, enunciators attempt to further securitize the issue, attracting public attention through dramatic means to bring it to a new climax. The aim of these securitizing actors is to justify taking more intensive exceptional measures than those taken previously in securitizing the same threatening issue. In this paper, I focus on the securitization of the Iranian nuclear project in Israel, which began in the 1990s. Although the issue was successfully securitized at that time, and has been maintained as a securitized issue for years, it reached a new peak during Prime Minister Netanyahu's second government (2009-2013), particularly in 2012. I suggest that examining this case in developing the concept of securitization climax not only clarifies a number of aspects of politics, threat perception, and insecurity in Israel, but provides a more nuanced view of securitization dynamics.","Lupovici, Amir",0,,2160
2202,Driving experience moderates the effect of implicit versus explicit threat priming on hazard perception test,"Due to the controversial evidence regarding the efficacy of threat campaigns on driving behavior, we addressed the effects of explicit vs. implicit threats. As in other areas of advertisements, we hypothesized that an implicit threat would be more effective, i.e., generate more anxiety than an explicit threat. Furthermore, we hypothesized that such effects would be moderated by driving experience: more experienced drivers when threatened will rely on driving skills and perform in a less cautious manner vs. less experienced drivers who have not yet acquired these skills, and therefore will tend to calm their fear by exercising more caution. Driving behavior in this experimental design was addressed by the Hazard Perception ({HP}) task. Results were as expected. Anxiety was higher under implicit vs. explicit threat. {HP} scores however were overall the same for both groups. Implicit priming generated less-cautious behavior in high-experienced drivers while generating more caution for less-experienced drivers. Demonstrating in a single experiment all three driving patterns following threat, namely, no change in driving behavior (whole sample), more cautious driving behavior (less-experience) and less cautious behavior (more-experience), potentially comprises an important step in resolving the aforementioned disparity concerning effects of threat campaigns on driving behavior.

2203,{CONSTITUTIONAL} {RETROACTIVITY} {IN} {CRIMINAL} {PROCEDURE},"The ""watershed"" doctrine gives prisoners a constitutional basis to reopen their cases based on a new due process protection that would have made a difference had it been announced before their appeals were exhausted. The Supreme Court has imposed nearly impossible conditions, however, for any new rule of criminal procedure to apply retroactively to a final conviction or sentence. No such vile can be backdated unless it enhances not only the accuracy of criminal verdicts, but also ""our very understanding of the bedrock"" tenets of fairness in criminal trials. The Court refers to rules that satisfy both these requirements as ""watersheds."" In the quarter-century since it established this doctrine, the Court has denied the accuracy-and-fairness credentials to every one of the dozens of new rules it has characterized as procedural and whose watershed status it has considered. Scholarly consensus accordingly casts watershed doctrine as exceptional, esoteric, and insignificant. This Article challenges that consensus. We use the dynamic concentration model of game theory to show how watershed doctrine counteracts the structural undersupply of constitutional due process rules. The Court maintains too small a caseload to scrutinize more than a fraction of due process violations or specify every such procedural demand. That institution is accordingly ill equipped to rein in the punitive tendencies of elected state judges who owe their jobs to electorates that tend to value crime prevention more than defendants' rights. Watershed doctrine potentially mitigates this enforcement problem by creating an extreme, if low-probability, threat of repealing scores of final convictions. By issuing a single new watershed rule, the Court can mandate sweeping retrials or release of prisoners into the public. This existential threat provides an overlooked reason why state courts might insulate their states' criminal procedures against Supreme Court incursions. To achieve the desired insulation, state courts can create constitutional safe harbors by trying to align their procedures with watersheds they project the Court might announce in the future. Indirect support for this theory comes from our comprehensive study of the hundreds of watershed decisions that state courts have issued since 1989. We narrowed this list down to the 228 controlling decisions about whether to backdate distinct due process rules across different jurisdictions. Our analysis found that twenty-seven, or more than one in nine, of these decisions inflate the retroactivity rights of criminal defendants.","Fox, Dov and Stein, Alex",0,,2162
2204,"Counter Cultures, Group Dynamics and Religious Terrorism","Totalistic ideologies are breeding grounds for radicalization. Communities that adhere to such ideologies tend to rally when they feel threatened by powerful outsiders. Under such circumstances, community leaders become central. If they frame the situation as an existential threat to the community itself or to its most sacred values, they will accelerate the radicalization process and subsequently increase the prospects of violent actions by group members. The shift to violence takes place in the framework of close-knit social networks within the broader radicalized community. These networks consist of individuals who usually live in the same area and engage in continuous interaction among themselves. Such interactions bolster their communal commitment and develop a collective mindset that facilitates the slide of some of the individuals into violence. Those who eventually descend into terrorism usually exhibit strong identification with the community's values and extreme alienation towards the outside world. They also enjoy high levels of biographical availability. These hypotheses are tested using the case study of Jewish terrorism in Israel between 1948 and 2006.","Perliger, Arie and Pedahzur, Ami",0,,2163
2205,"Risk Perceptions and Terror Management Theory: Assessing Public Responses to Urban Flooding in Toronto, Canada","Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) suggests that mortality salience ({MS}), or death reminders, should impact environmental behaviour and decision-making by increasing consumption and resource usage, shifting aesthetic preferences toward cultivated landscapes, and affecting adherence to environmental norms. We examined {MS} effects on residential flood risk perceptions in Toronto, Canada, following the major urban flood in July 2013. Survey responses were analyzed to assess risk perceptions across nine categories; analyses through the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test show statistically insignificant differences between {MS} and control groups for all subcategories. Coupled with the {TMT} literature, the results indicate that existential anxiety is more likely to affect flood risk perceptions through worldview defense when the social dimension of flooding is made clear. Toronto residents' societal beliefs about flooding play a major role in guiding flood management strategies. Our results provide scholarly and practical direction for flood risk communication strategies to promote the adoption of private flood-prevention measures, suggesting that anthropocentric framing of flooding issues will not induce negative environmental behaviour and may increase concern for flooding issues.","Mann, Carolyn and Wolfe, S.

2206,Specific and Individuated Death Reflection Fosters Identity Integration,"Identity integration is the process wherein a person assimilates multiple or conflicting identities (e.g., beliefs, values, needs) into a coherent, unified self-concept. Three experiments examined whether contemplating mortality in a specific and individuated manner (i.e., via the death reflection manipulation) facilitated outcomes indicative of identity integration. Participants in the death reflection condition (vs. control conditions) considered positive and negative life experiences as equally important in shaping their current identity (Experiment 1), regarded self-serving values and other-serving values as equally important life principles (Experiment 2), and were equally motivated to pursue growth-oriented and security-oriented needs (Experiment 3). Death reflection motivates individuals to integrate conflicting aspects of their identity into a coherent self-concept. Given that identity integration is associated with higher well-being, the findings have implications for understanding the psychological benefits of existential contemplation.","Blackie, Laura E.

2207,Phrasing the Charitable Bequest Inquiry,"This paper reports interest levels associated with twenty-three different phrasings of a request to leave a gift to charity in a will among 9964 survey respondents. Previous research suggests that a review of one's life story may be an important component of bequest decision-making. Other findings suggest that mortality reminders may increase support for social norms and the pursuit of symbolic immortality. The attempts to reference symbolic immortality tested here were not effective. However, results supported avoiding extraneous death terms (""that will take effect at my death"") and using social norms (""many people like to leave a gift to charity in their wills""). The strongest support arose for the addition of the phrase ""to support causes that have been important in their/your life/lives"" to explain either the respondent's or the social norm exemplars' intent in making such a gift. Among common terms, ""a gift to charity in your will"" generated greater interest than substitute terms such as ""bequest,"" ""leave a legacy"" or ""remember your favorite charities."".","James, Russell N.",0,,2166
2208,"Mortality Salience, System Justification, and Candidate Evaluations in the 2012 {US} Presidential Election","Experiments conducted during the 2004 and 2008 U.S. presidential elections suggested that mortality salience primes increased support for President George W. Bush and Senator John {McCain}, respectively. Some interpreted these results as reflecting ""conservative shift"" following exposure to threat, whereas others emphasized preferences for ""charismatic"" leadership following exposure to death primes. To assess both hypotheses in the context of a new election cycle featuring a liberal incumbent who was considered to be charismatic, we conducted four experiments shortly before the 2012 election involving President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney. Contrary to earlier studies, there was little evidence that mortality salience, either by itself or in interaction with political orientation, affected overall candidate ratings or voting intentions. However, a significant interaction between mortality salience and system justification in some studies indicated a more circumscribed effect. The failure to ""replicate"" previous results in the context of this election may be attributable to disagreement among participants as to which of the candidates better represented the societal status quo.","Sterling, Joanna and Jost, John T. and Shrout, Patrick E.",1,,2167
2209,Neuromodulation of group prejudice and religious belief,"People cleave to ideological convictions with greater intensity in the aftermath of threat. The posterior medial frontal cortex ({pMFC}) plays a key role in both detecting discrepancies between desired and current conditions and adjusting subsequent behavior to resolve such conflicts. Building on prior literature examining the role of the {pMFC} in shifts in relatively low-level decision processes, we demonstrate that the {pMFC} mediates adjustments in adherence to political and religious ideologies. We presented participants with a reminder of death and a critique of their in-group ostensibly written by a member of an out-group, then experimentally decreased both avowed belief in God and out-group derogation by downregulating {pMFC} activity via transcranial magnetic stimulation. The results provide the first evidence that group prejudice and religious belief are susceptible to targeted neuromodulation, and point to a shared cognitive mechanism underlying concrete and abstract decision processes. We discuss the implications of these findings for further research characterizing the cognitive and affective mechanisms at play.","Holbrook, Colin and Izuma, Keise and Deblieck, Choi and Fessler, Daniel M.

2210,Self-Esteem Modulates Amygdala-Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Connectivity in Response to Mortality Threats,"Reminders of death often elicit defensive responses in individuals, especially among those with low self-esteem. Although empirical evidence indicates that self-esteem serves as a buffer against mortality threats, the precise neural mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to test the hypothesis that self-esteem modulates neural responses to death-related stimuli, especially functional connectivity within the limbic-frontal circuitry, thereby affecting subsequent defensive reactions. As predicted, individuals with high self-esteem subjected to a mortality threat exhibited increased amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({VLPFC}) connectivity during the processing of death-related stimuli compared with individuals who have low self-esteem. Further analysis revealed that stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and the {VLPFC} predicted a subsequent decline in responding defensively to those who threaten one's beliefs. These results suggest that the amygdala-{VLPFC} interaction, which is modulated by self-esteem, can reduce the defensiveness caused by death-related stimuli, thereby providing a neural explanation for why individuals with high self-esteem exhibit less defensive reactions to mortality threats.","Yanagisawa, Kuniaki and Abe, Nobuhito and Kashima, Emiko S. and Nomura, Michio",1,,2169
2211,'War on Terror' in our backyard: effects of framing and violent {ISIS} propaganda on anti-Muslim prejudice,"Framing metaphors for counterterrorism have been analyzed theoretically but their effect has not yet been fully understood empirically. One framing metaphor that has been employed for counterterrorism is a 'War on Terror'. The present study examined the effect of using the phrase 'War on Terror' on support for security policies that unfairly target Muslims. We manipulated the frame to make federal action or community action salient. Additionally, we tested the effect of the release of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ({ISIL}/{ISIS}/Daesh, hereafter {ISIS}) propaganda films by collecting data before and after the February 2015 video featuring the execution of 21 Egyptian Copts by a Libyan {ISIS} group. We found that, after the video was released, a community-based framing of the 'War on Terror' significantly increased support for anti-Muslim security policies. We also examined the demographics of those who had seen {ISIS} videos versus those who had not and the factors that predicted whether participants were distressed by the videos. Those who had seen the videos were more likely to be male and have personal ties to the military or law enforcement. Those who were distressed by the videos were more likely to be politically conservative, female, younger, and have personal ties to the military or law enforcement.","Hatton, Arthur T. and Nielsen, Michael E.",0,,2170
2212,Narratives of Islam in Uzbekistan: authoritarian myths and the Janus-state syndrome,"Under the late Islom Karimov, the authoritarian regimes in Uzbekistan created dual myths of Islam. On the one hand, Islam was encompassed in the larger context of manaviyat (spirituality), and on the other, a myth of an Islamic 'extremism' that challenges security and stability on a regional scale was cultivated. This 'threat' is so pervasive and pernicious that it commands the authoritarian nature of governance that characterizes the Karimov era, leading to a Janus-state syndrome in which Islam is simultaneously cast as a sine qua non of national myth and an existential threat to state security. This article examines the mythology of political Islam in Uzbekistan and the Janus-state syndrome resulting from the duality of Islamic myth. It argues that a civil society cannot flourish in Central Asia unless moderate Islamic groups are allowed to build the very social structures that provide the foundation for interaction, peaceful coexistence, toleration and pluralism.","Hanks, Reuel R.",0,,2171
2213,Individual determinants of punitive attitudes towards sexual and domestic abuse offenders,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address individual factors predicting punitive attitudes towards sexual and domestic offences and offenders have received little attention. Design/methodology/approach - In Study 1,137 participants completed a 25-item online questionnaire exploring individual factors hypothesised to predict punitive attitudes towards four sexual crimes: rape, paedophilia, incest and bestiality. In Study 2,100 participants completed a similar questionnaire exploring individual factors hypothesised to predict punitive attitudes towards male and female emotional, physical and sexual abusers. Findings - The standard multiple regression models of Study 1 found that age (i.e. being older), belief in a just world and gender (i.e. being female) were predictors of harsher punitive attitudes. The models of Study 2 found that the low score on the social dominance scale was the most common predictor. Research limitations/implications - This survey-based project presents a nuanced picture that could be complemented by the inclusion of a wider range of more complex factors and follow-on qualitative studies. Practical implications - The key message from this study is to inform the public on the role of personality factors in developing punitive attitudes. Social implications - It is vital to increase the legislators' and the people' awareness of the factors shaping the public impressions of criminal justice processes and evidence-based treatment effectiveness. Originality/value - This relatively modest paper offers insight of personality factors into people's punitive attitudes shaping actual legislation.","Palasinski, Marek and Shortl and , Neil",0,,2172

2215,Catastrophic fixes: cyclical devaluation and accumulation through climate change impacts,"This paper investigates the scales and temporalities through which climate change impacts may be rendered into socio-ecological fixes for crises of overaccumulation within the (re)insurance industry. The property insurance and catastrophe reinsurance sectors are notorious for their cyclicity, with prices and returns oscillating dramatically between soft and hard markets. The problem of overaccummulation in soft market periods is often resolved by the destruction of reinsurers' capital reserves through huge catastrophic losses. This is typically followed by the revision of catastrophe models and reestimation of exposed values, processes which absorb additional (re)insurance capital and provide technoscientific legitimacy for raising rates. Reframing climate change risk in terms of ecologically-sourced devaluation suggests that, rather than posing an immediate existential threat, in the short to medium term the uncertain impacts of global climate change might constitute a recurrent catastrophic fix for particular segments of financial capital. This highlights both the productivity of uncertainty about climate change impacts and the limits of presuming that the operations of the private insurance market can produce a built environment more adapted to climate change. Rather, the more likely outcome is splintering protectionism: a patchwork of high risk, high reward areas where insurance is available only to those with the ability to pay rising premiums, leaving the state to manage the retreat and relocation of less remunerative properties and populations.","Johnson, Leigh",0,,2174
2216,Determinants of death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer,"Objective To examine the presence of death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer and to identify the psychosocial and disease-related factors associated with it. Design Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a phase 2 pilot intervention trial. Setting Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. Participants 60 adult outpatients with metastatic breast, endocrine, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, genitourinary and lung cancer. Main outcome measure Death anxiety, as measured by the Death and Dying Distress Scale ({DADDS}). Results Thirty-two per cent of the sample reported death anxiety of at least moderate severity. The most distressing concern involved fears about the impact of one's death on others, and the least distressing concerns were related to dying alone or suddenly. According to regression analyses, death anxiety was negatively associated with self-esteem, b=-1.73, {CI}0.95 (-2.57 to -0.90) and positively associated with physical symptom burden, b=1.38, {CI}0.95 (0.44 to 2.31), having children under 18years of age in the family, b=13.3, {CI}0.95 (2.15 to 24.5), and age, b=0.40, {CI}0.95 (0.0023 to 0.79). The physical symptoms most strongly associated with death anxiety were changes in physical appearance, b=18.8, {CI}0.95 (8.21 to29.5), and pain, b=10.1, {CI}0.95 (0.73 to 19.5). Conclusions The findings suggest that death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer is common and determined by the interaction of individual factors, family circumstances and physical suffering. Multidimensional interventions that take into account these and other factors may be most likely to be effective to alleviate this death-related distress.","Neel, Caroline and Lo, Chris and Rydall, Anne and Hales, Sarah and Rodin, Gary",0,,2175
2217,Sex Differences in Salivary Cortisol Responses to Sex-Linked Stressors: A Test of the Tend-and-Befriend Model,"This study examined sex differences in salivary cortisol responses to experimental stressors and subsequent desire to affiliate in the context of mortality cues following the Tend-and-Befriend model. Participants were randomly assigned to a mortality salience prime or a control condition. They were then assigned to view a video of crying infants or a video designed to elicit out-group threat. As predicted, females showed more cortisol reactivity to the video of crying infants and males showed more cortisol reactivity to the video of hate speech in the no prime condition. Males receiving a mortality salience prime, surprisingly, showed a weaker cortisol response to the out-group threat video compared to males who received no prime. Results provide further support of using the Tend-and-Befriend model to predict differences in stress response system activity between men and women, as well as modifications to that theory that incorporate male responses to out-group threats.","Byrd-Craven, Jennifer and Auer, Br and on J. and Kennison, Shelia M.",0,,2176
2218,Societies' tightness moderates age differences in perceived justifiability of morally debatable behaviors,"Research on age differences in moral judgment tends to focus on children and adolescents. The current study examined age differences in perceived justifiability of morally debatable behaviors across adulthood cross-culturally. A large cross-cultural dataset consisting of 25,142 individuals of varying ages (15-95 years old) from 20 societies was drawn from the World Values Survey. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test age differences in perceived justifiability of morally debatable behaviors on issues pertaining to honesty and fairness as well as the moderating effect of societies' tightness. Across societies, older adults judged moral transgression less leniently than did younger adults. However, this pattern was moderated by the societies' tightness, such that age was a stronger predictor of perceived justifiability of morally debatable behaviors in loose societies relative to tight societies. The current study highlights the importance of examining moral development from the lifespan development perspective. The findings may illuminate potential mechanisms for inter-generational misunderstanding about moral issues.","Jiang, Da and Li, Tianyuan and Hamamura, Takeshi",0,,2177
2219,Sending an Avatar to Do a Human's Job: Compliance with Authority Persists Despite the Uncanny Valley,"Just as physical appearance affects social influence in human communication, it may also affect the processing of advice conveyed through avatars, computer-animated characters, and other human-like interfaces. Although the most persuasive computer interfaces are often the most human-like, they have been predicted to incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy attributed to characters that appear eerily human. Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computer-animated double.","Patel, Himalaya and {MacDorman}, Karl F.",0,,2178

2221,Israel's Construction of Iran as an Existential Threat,"Since 1993, every prime minister of Israel has, at one time or another, portrayed Iran as the gravest threat confronting his country. journalists and commentators have generally taken those expressions of alarm, focused especially on Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, at face value. But a close examination of the initial articulation and subsequent evolution of the Israeli stance over the 1990s reveals that Israel's claim was in essence an instrumental policy, serving a range of unacknowledged domestic and foreign policy objectives. This paper argues that the evidence indicates that Israel either misrepresented the facts or manipulated them in order to advance its interests on other issues, including its standing with the United States and the concessions required of it by Oslo {II}.","Porter, Gareth",0,,2180
2222,"Selling space colonization and immortality: A psychosocial, anthropological critique of the rush to colonize Mars","Extensive media coverage regarding the proposal to send four people to Mars by 2025 has exploded recently. Private enterprise has taken the reins to venture into space, which has typically only been reserved for government agencies. I argue, that with this new direction comes less regulation, raising questions regarding the ethics of sending people into outer space to colonize Mars within a decade. Marketers selling colonization to the public include perspectives such as biological drives, species survival, inclusiveness and utopian ideals. I challenge these narratives by suggesting that much of our desire to colonize space within the next decade is motivated by ego, money and romanticism. More specifically, I will examine the roles that fear and stories of immortality play within selling space and how those stories are marketed. I am passionate about space and hope that one day humanity will colonize other worlds, but the rush to settle is dangerous and careless. I assert that humanity should first gain more experience and knowledge before colonizing outer space, using this research to mitigate the risk to astronauts and proceed with careful consideration for the lives of potential astronauts.

2223,Get off my lawn: Territorial civil wars and subsequent social intolerance in the public,"It is argued that threat related to territorial civil wars generates negative interpersonal attitudes that are both more intense and more broadly oriented than previously thought. That is, civil wars fought over issues of autonomy or secession foment social intolerance, a broad orientation that extends well beyond members of former enemy groups to an aversion to interpersonal differences in general. The expectation that the issue the civil war is fought over is consequential is tested with data from the World Values Survey and the {UCDP}/{PRIO} Armed Conflict Dataset. The empirical domain consists of over 130,000 individuals across 123 surveys in 69 countries over the 1989-2008 period. Results from multilevel models indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between domestic territorial conflicts and subsequent social intolerance. Substantively, territorial civil wars have a far greater impact on individuals' attitudes than do standard' correlates of social intolerance that are well established in the literature. Further, non-territorial civil war is unrelated to attitudes of social intolerance. Empirical results are robust to several model specifications and are not a mere artifact of the potential reverse relationship, whereby intolerant societies are (erroneously) presumed to be at a higher risk of civil wars in the first place. The findings have implications for the understanding of civil war resolution, civil war reoccurrence, and the contextual correlates of interpersonal intolerance.","Tir, Jaroslav and Singh, Shane P.",0,,2182
2224,Naturalizing Sentimentalism for Environmental Ethics,"Jesse Prinz and Shaun Nichols have argued that within metaethics, sentimentalism is the theory that best accords with empirical facts about human moral psychology. Recent findings in experimental moral psychology, they argue, indicate that emotions are psychologically central to our moral concepts. One way of testing the empirical adequacy of sentimentalism is by looking at research on environmental values. A classic problem in environmental ethics is providing an account of the intrinsic value of nonhuman entities, which is often thought to be inconsistent with sentimentalism. However, no supporters of sentimentalist accounts of environmental values have evaluated the empirical adequacy of their claims. The relevant evidence falls under two broad categories: (1) responses to nature itself and (2) moral evaluations of environmental behaviors. The evidence indicates that both valuing and disvaluing nature are ultimately grounded in emotions.","Kasperbauer, T. J.",0,,2183
2225,Tactical Nuclear Weapons ({TNW}) - The Pakistani Perspective,"Tactical Nuclear Weapons or {TNW} as seen through the Cold War lens are weapons with lesser yields or shorter ranges as compared to strategic weapons meant for counter value and counter force targets. During the East-West conflict these weapons were located in advance positions for use on the European battlefield to deter or counter a Soviet invasion. To rival these, the Soviets developed a whole range of their own {TNW}. Some of these weapons are still deployed in Europe and form part of the non-deployed arsenals of {US} and Russian nuclear forces. Ever since Pakistan introduced the battlefield range Nasr/Hatf {IX} ballistic missile a few years ago, it has been criticized for triggering a new arms race in the region. Pakistan's security establishment regards all kinds of nuclear weapons as guarantors against a growing existential threat. Initially it was argued that the term {TNW} did not necessarily hold true in the context of the South Asian subcontinent, where all nuclear weapons irrespective of ranges or yields are basically weapons of deterrence but, subsequently, it was argued that these missiles were part of the concept of Full Spectrum Deterrence. Under this arrangement, the {TNW} covered the immediate battlefield to deter the short sharp thrusts at multiple points below the perceived nuclear threshold within the framework of the Cold Start Doctrine ({CSD}). Combined together, a mix of short and long range missiles is also expected to find a chink in the Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Shield ({BMDS}) system. This paper examines in an objective manner the Pakistani motivations to pursue this developmental strategy and why it will persist with it.","Yamin, Tughral",0,,2184

The killing of 132 school children in Peshawar on 16 December last year is a sobering reminder that extremism poses an existential threat to Pakistan. To overcome the challenge of growing extremism, Pakistan should introduce a national Countering Violent Extremism ({CVE}) policy, in addition to the on-going de-radicalization programmes in different parts of the country. The {CVE} policy should comprise of individual-focused de-radicalization, and environment-focused counter-radicalization strategies. In this regard, a contextual understanding of the extremist challenge in Pakistan's ethnically heterogeneous and religiously diverse society is essential to formulate the right-kind-of {CVE} policies. In Pakistan violent extremism is a multifaceted and multi-layered phenomenon. Given the multifaceted scope and magnitude of the problem, Pakistan needs to fight both the reality and ideality of the challenge through a whole of community approach. A joint state-society response is indispensable for creating an environment that helps people to resist the appeal of militant ideologies. The on-going narrow-focused de-radicalization interventions in Pakistan will gradually lose their efficacy, as long as a moderate environment hostile to terrorism and militancy is not created through a comprehensive national level {CVE} policy.","Basit, Abdul",0,,2185
2227,Extremism reduces conflict arousal and increases values affirmation in response to meaning violations,"In the social psychological threat-compensation literature, there is an apparent contradiction whereby relatively extreme beliefs both decrease markers of physiological arousal following meaning violations, and increase the values affirmation behaviors understood as a palliative responses to this arousal. We hypothesize that this is due to the differential impact of measuring extremism on behavioral inhibition and approach systems following meaning violations, whereby extremism both reduces markers of conflict arousal ({BIS}) and increases values affirmation ({BAS}) unrelated to this initial arousal. Using pupil dilation as a proxy for immediate conflict arousal, we found that the same meaning violation (anomalous playing cards) evoked greater pupil dilation, and that this pupillary reaction was diminished in participants who earlier reported extreme beliefs. We also found that reporting extreme beliefs was associated with greater affirmation of an unrelated meaning framework, where this affirmation was unrelated to physiological markers of conflict arousal.

2228,"Why ban Batasuna? Terrorism, political parties and democracy","This article addresses the question: under what conditions do democracies ban political parties? It does so by testing three hypotheses generated by a disparate literature on party bans in a 'most likely case', namely, the proscription of radical Basque nationalist parties Herri Batasuna, Euskal Herritarrok and Batasuna in 2003. These parties were banned for their integration in a terrorist network led by Euskadi Ta Askatasuna ({ETA}). The hypotheses are that democracies ban anti-system parties if (i) anti-system parties do not unambiguously eschew violence; (ii) alternatives to proscription are not effective; and (iii) relevant office holders have reason to believe they will not be disadvantaged in their pursuit of office or votes for supporting the ban. Case study findings confirm the hypotheses other than that on violence, given that {ETA}'s political wing escaped proscription for around two decades before it was banned. Explaining this finding - or addressing the question of why the parties were not banned until 2003 the article develops two further hypotheses, namely, that democracies ban anti-system parties if (iv) the parties have been 'securitized' as an existential threat to the state or democratic community and (v) proscription is the preference of all veto players.","Bourne, Angela",0,,2187
2229,"Before the Creative Class: Blight, Gay Movies, and Family Values in the Haight-Ashbury Neighborhood, 1964","During the summer of 1964, the Haight Theater in San Francisco operated briefly as ""gay movie house"" that screened B-movies, held drag shows, and hosted male physique contests. For Haight-Ashbury neighborhood activists, already engaged in a fight to block a planned freeway and reverse the attrition of white families from the community, the reopened theater presented an existential threat to the family-oriented character of the neighborhood. They saw the growing visibility of gay men in the area as a harbinger of social disintegration that could, if allowed to continue, result in the classification of the area as blighted, making it a candidate for demolition and renewal. The moral anxieties of Haight residents are best understood not simply as the manifestation of an inherent, latent homophobia but as part of the broader struggle of neighborhood activists to stave off the destructive impacts of urban renewal and freeway expansion. The episode reveals the degree to which taken-for-granted assumptions about the social and economic impacts of gay men on urban space have changed as postwar planning discourses about blight and social disorganization have been eclipsed by more contemporary narratives of gay-led urban revitalization and the productivity of creative capital.","Scott, Damon",0,,2188
2230,Contextualizing Political Security in South Asia,"This article examines four hypotheses. First, political security is a broader canvas that includes human security apart from state security. The political insecurity is perennial source of social and economic securities for human beings and an existential threat to the state at large. Second, the people and the states in the South Asian region are suffering from the syndrome of political insecurity. A major source of political insecurity is exclusive nationalism that has made the ideology of state, the most contested terrain and thereby undermined the basis of South Asian states leading to the crisis of legitimacy. Third, undemocratic political structures and fragile democratic structures have further complicated the security scenario by hampering the organizational stability of the state in the South Asian region. Fourth, the systemic dilemma of governments in South Asia is that the institutions of governance often bypass people already deprived on multiple counts and thereby not only drive such people towards political violence but also enhance the legitimacy deficit for the South Asian states.","Singh, Baljit",0,,2189
2231,"Uncertainty, god, and scrupulosity: Uncertainty salience and priming god concepts interact to cause greater fears of sin","Background and objectives: Difficulties tolerating uncertainty are considered central to scrupulosity, a moral/religious presentation of obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}). We examined whether uncertainty salience (i.e., exposure to a state of uncertainty) caused fears of sin and fears of God, as well as whether priming God concepts affected the impact of uncertainty salience on those fears. Method: An internet sample of community adults (N = 120) who endorsed holding a belief in God or a higher power were randomly assigned to an experimental manipulation of (1) salience (uncertainty or insecurity) and (2) prime (God concepts or neutral). Results: As predicted, participants who received the uncertainty salience and God concept priming reported the greatest fears of sin. There were no mean-level differences in the other conditions. The effect was not attributable to religiosity and the manipulations did not cause negative affect. Limitations: We used a nonclinical sample recruited from the internet. Conclusions: These results support cognitive-behavioral models suggesting that religious uncertainty is important to scrupulosity. Implications of these results for future research are discussed.

2232,Does the thought of death contribute to the memory benefit of encoding with a survival scenario?,"Four studies tested whether the thought of death contributes to the survival processing advantage found in memory tests (i.e., the survival effect). In the first study, we replicated the ""Dying To Remember"" ({DTR}) effect identified by Burns and colleagues whereby activation of death thoughts led to better retention than an aversive control situation. In Study 2, we compared an ancestral survival scenario, a modern survival scenario and a ""life-after-death"" scenario. The modern survival scenario and the dying scenario led to higher levels of recall than the ancestral scenario. In Study 3, we used a more salient death-thought scenario in which people imagine themselves on death row. Results showed that the ""death-row"" scenario yielded a level of recall similar to that of the ancestral survival condition. We also collected ratings of death-related thoughts (Studies 3 and 4) and of survival-related and planning thoughts (Study 4). The ratings indicated that death-related thoughts were induced more by the dying scenarios than by the survival scenarios, whereas the reverse was observed for both survival-related and planning thoughts. The findings are discussed in the light of two contrasting views of the influence of mortality salience in the survival effect.","Bugaiska, Aurelia and Mermillod, Martial and Bonin, Patrick",0,,2191
2233,Error/Erasure-Resilient and Complexity-Constrained Zero-Delay Distributed Coding for Large-Scale Sensor Networks,"There has been considerable interest in distributed source coding ({DSC}) in recent years, primarily due to its potential contributions to low-power sensor networks. However, two major obstacles pose an existential threat to practical deployment of such techniques: the exponential growth of decoding complexity with network size and coding rates and the critical requirement of resilience to bit errors and erasures, given the severe channel conditions in many wireless sensor network applications. This article proposes a novel, unified approach for large-scale, error/erasure-resilient {DSC} that incorporates an optimally designed, nearest neighbor classifier-based decoding framework, where the design explicitly controls performance versus decoding complexity. Motivated by the highly nonconvex nature of the cost function, we present a deterministic annealing-based optimization algorithm for the joint design of the system parameters, which further enhances the performance over the greedy iterative descent technique. Simulation results on both synthetic and real sensor network data provide strong evidence for performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art techniques and may open the door to practical deployment of {DSC} in large sensor networks. Moreover, the framework provides a principled way to naturally scale to large networks while constraining decoder complexity, thereby enabling performance gains that increase with network size.","Viswanatha, Kumar and Ramaswamy, Sharadh and Saxena, Ankur and Rose, Kenneth",0,,2192
2234,"{EVIL} {IN} {FAMILIAR} {FORMS}: {ANTI}-{SEMITISM}, {RACISM}, {TOTALITARIANISM}, {RELIGIOUS} {EXTREMISM}","The paper proposes a general model of the psychology of evil based on the hypothesis that the conditions of human evolution: eusociality, the need to recognize the emotions of others and to predict their behavior, the acceptance of symbolic reality and need for an overarching frame of reference (symbolic universe) as well as the need for consistency and pain avoidance have led to the evolution of specialized brain structures and behavioral strategies. Evil is the unintended result of the interaction between these adaptive mechanisms. The specific forms of evil being discussed originate in the special manner the brain processes information with religious and/or and ideological content, bypassing cortical structures dedicated to the control of social behavior such as the lateral prefrontal cortex. The appraisal of social situations is distorted, resulting in perceived threat and increased mortality salience, which in turn leads to less differentiated, more emotional responses and scapegoating. Memes incorporated in the symbolic universe help the spreading and maintenance of bigoted and/or totalitarian belief systems. Each form of evil discussed creates its own myth: worldwide Jewish conspiracy and the Jew as God killer, the myth of destiny based on racial superiority, the myth of an egalitarian and just future for mankind Those who disagree are seen as fair targets for discrimination, aggression and extermination and obedience to authority facilitates the use of violence against them. Adaptive mechanisms whose function is to mitigate the effect of extreme experiences, such as psychic numbing and doubling shield the perpetrators of violence against the consequences of their own actions and self-deception helps them maintain the appearance of normality. The fact that these forms of evil originate in adaptive mechanisms assures their durability.","Dan, Peter",0,,2193
2235,Explaining the Deterioration of Elderly Consumers' Behaviour through the Broken Windows Theory,"This study investigates whether a visible signal of physical decay - specifically, the lack of front teeth - may represent an antecedent of a deterioration of the elderly consumers' buying behaviour. To this end, the study compares the purchase decision-making process, shopping motivations, emotional states arising from the shopping experience, and materialistic tendency of elderly consumers missing their front teeth with those of elderly consumers who do not display this lack. Findings reveal that the former consumers are likely to engage in unplanned purchases, pursue erratic goals, experience high levels of arousal when shopping, and are more materialist than the latter ones. Furthermore, the same consumers reported that the quality and quantity of their consumptions decreased since they lost their front teeth. Such results derive from the negative social perception of physical deterioration and call for marketing approaches aimed at improving these consumers' quality of life.","Guido, Gianluigi and Pino, Giovanni and Prete, M.

2236,Climate Change: Leveraging Legacy,"This Article explores whether a private governance initiative can harness legacy concerns to address climate change. The socio-temporal trap is an important barrier to climate change mitigation: The costs of reducing carbon emissions will be incurred by this generation, but most of the benefits will accrue to future generations. Research suggests that social influences including concerns about legacy can induce individuals to overcome collective action problems, but individuals know that future generations will not have information about who acted today in ways meriting social sanctions or rewards. Insufficient information may undermine three aspects of legacy-driven behavior: the concern about how one's actions today will be viewed by future generations, the concern about how these actions will affect the social status of progeny, and the alignment of these actions with moral beliefs regarding the treatment of future generations. Making legacy-related information public today may also influence social sanctions and rewards from contemporaries. The Article examines the nature of legacy concerns, their effects on behavior, and the feasibility of a private legacy registry designed to record individuals' responses to climate change in ways that will not only be disclosed today, but will also be easily accessible for many generations.","V and enbergh, Michael P. and Raimi, Kaitlin T.",0,,2195
2237,The Divergent Effects of Mortality Salience of Self versus Mortality Salience of a Loved One on Materialistic Consumption,"In the present research, we argue that there are two distinct types of mortality salience, namely mortality salience of self ({MSS}) which is awareness of one's own death and mortality salience of a loved one ({MSLO}) which is awareness of the death of a loved one. Studies based on Terror Management Theory have assumed that {MSLO} individuals' response might follow predictably from the perspective of the theory. However, bereavement studies implied that {MSLO} individuals may have distinct response in comparison to {MSS} individuals. In four studies, we tested the convergent versus divergent assumptions and found that {MSS} and {MSLO} have divergent effects on materialistic consumption. Specifically, the robustness of the divergence has been tested on product preference for high-status brands, the choice between a materialistic product and an experience, the level of desire for money and the choice between two magazines that highlights different levels of materialistic values. We later proposed that future studies should try to explore the two mechanisms, namely negative emotions and goal orientation that might explain the divergence on materialistic consumption.","Wang, Yanan",0,,2196
2238,Differences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology,"Disputes between those holding differing political views are ubiquitous and deep-seated, and they often follow common, recognizable lines. The supporters of tradition and stability, sometimes referred to as conservatives, do battle with the supporters of innovation and reform, sometimes referred to as liberals. Understanding the correlates of those distinct political orientations is probably a prerequisite for managing political disputes, which are a source of social conflict that can lead to frustration and even bloodshed. A rapidly growing body of empirical evidence documents a multitude of ways in which liberals and conservatives differ from each other in purviews of life with little direct connection to politics, from tastes in art to desire for closure and from disgust sensitivity to the tendency to pursue new information, but the central theme of the differences is a matter of debate. In this article, we argue that one organizing element of the many differences between liberals and conservatives is the nature of their physiological and psychological responses to features of the environment that are negative. Compared with liberals, conservatives tend to register greater physiological responses to such stimuli and also to devote more psychological resources to them. Operating from this point of departure, we suggest approaches for refining understanding of the broad relationship between political views and response to the negative. We conclude with a discussion of normative implications, stressing that identifying differences across ideological groups is not tantamount to declaring one ideology superior to another.","Hibbing, John R. and Smith, Kevin B. and Alford, John R.",0,,2197
2239,"Al-Qaeda messaging evolution and positioning, 1998-2008: Propaganda analysis revisited","We present an analysis of terrorist propaganda using Al-Qaeda ({AQ}) between 1998 and 2008 as a case study using semiotic and propaganda analytic approaches. Our findings suggest {AQ} position themselves using a variety of propaganda techniques, especially on the notion of a global conspiracy, an existential threat, against Islam. Their key contribution to the evolution of conflict has been to emancipate the political marketing/public relations component and, thus, to redefine the essence of conflict. {AQ} design sophisticated propaganda, use segmented message design and have improved their production values over time. They have also crudely attempted to influence Western European and {US} elections. The authors conclude that {AQ}'s positioning strategy is based on framing a death-centred militant worldview as its precise opposite, a pious life of struggle with rewards in the afterlife. This article makes descriptive and methodological contributions to the interdisciplinary literature on propaganda. It makes a contribution by explaining how {AQ}'s positioning strategy evolved between 1998 and 2008, an analysis which will be of particular interest to those who seek to understand the wider societal applications of terrorist use of propaganda and who seek to counter its effects. It makes a further methodological contribution by providing an integrated method by which to evaluate propaganda, using a combination of semiotic, content and propaganda analysis approaches.","Baines, Paul R. and O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas J.",0,,2198
2240,How far does 'societal security' travel? Securitization in South African immigration policies,"Responding to political developments in Europe during the 1990s, the Copenhagen School drew on speech act theory to argue that state leaders represent certain issues, including immigration, as existential threats to society. Two decades of friendly amendments and vociferous critiques have raised questions about how well the Copenhagen School's core concept of 'societal security' travels outside Europe. To assess the scope of this 'securitization' framework more systematically, we examine South Africa, a democracy that recently liberalized its immigration policies despite ethno-nationalist and racist traditions. Specifically, we test four claims: (1) that official discourses will target certain foreigners as an existential threat to collective identity; (2) that bureaucracies will consistently institutionalize these discourses; (3) that identity-oriented groups will be crucial to any societal contestation over these discourses; and (4) that successful securitization produces regionalization. These securitization claims hold up well, even though the nature of threats to societal security shift over time. Keeping in mind that no theory is without weaknesses, we recommend wider integration of the societal security concept into comparative studies of immigration policy, especially in democracies outside Europe.","Ilgit, Asli and Klotz, Audie",0,,2199
2241,Killing Civilians as an Inferior Input in a Rational Choice Model of Genocide and Mass Killing,"This article presents a rational choice model of a regime's incentive to allocate resources to fighting rebels and killing civilians when facing an internal threat to its political or territorial control. Assuming that intentional violence against civilians is an inferior input and fighting rebels is subject to increasing marginal returns, three weak state conditions - anocracy, new state status, and low income - increase civilian atrocities within the model. Also, two other risk factors for mass atrocities - discrimination and Cold War conditions - can be seen as ""price reducers"" for killing civilians, thus increasing the quantity demanded for civilian atrocities in the model. The modeling exercises show how intentional violence against civilians can be viewed through an economic lens of optimal choice and how rational choice theory provides a parsimonious way to theorize and generate empirically testable hypotheses about risk factors for genocide and mass killing.","Anderton, Charles",0,,2200
2242,Sidelining the Hardliners: A 2,"This article presents a modified two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A ""2 + 1 solution"" would see the establishment of a State of Palestine in the West Bank whose constitution proscribes the participation in government of any party whose platform calls for the elimination of Israel; Gaza would accede upon the reform or demise of Hamas. Achieving a state in the West Bank should be the proximate, urgent goal of the Palestinian people. Ideologically motivated Israeli settlement of the West Bank continues apace and threatens the viability of a twostate solution. Meanwhile, religiously motivated policies of colonization hide behind a security narrative conflating Hamas with Fatah and suggesting that the Palestinians pose an existential threat. The 2 + 1 solution, by excluding Hamas from a State of Palestine, directly addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns and thus carries the potential to lay bare the extent to which ideology informs Israeli policy. The approach also gives moderate Palestinians the opportunity to define the civic values and attributes of Palestinian national identity in a way that supports a lasting two state peace.","Ferrero, Christopher",0,,2201
2243,The jealous god: A problem in the definition of nationalism,"Scholarly definitions of nationalism often characterize the nation as the supreme object of loyalty (a jealous god'). Such restrictive definitions are unwise because they needlessly exclude a wide range of pro-national beliefs and practices. Demonstrating this, however, is harder than often thought, because the close linkage between nation and jurisdiction seems to entail a prioritization of national attachment over other identities. More pluralist accounts of nationhood, such as those of Margaret Moore or Charles Taylor, only partially resolve this dilemma, which requires consideration of the ultimate sacrifices entailed by war and conscription. Yet these cases of ultimate sacrifice should be understood not as endemic to nationhood alone but to all forms of strong communal attachment, when faced with existential threat. As it is this threat, rather than nationhood per se, that drives nationalism to take absolute forms, restrictive definitions may justifiably be rejected.","Millard, Gregory",0,,2202
2244,"James Mark Baldwin, the Baldwin Effect, Organic Selection, and the American ""Immigrant Crisis"" at the Turn of the Twentieth Century - Entangled Life: Organism and Environment in the Biological and Social Sciences","The ""Baldwin Effect,"" named after the turn-of-the-twentieth-century American psychologist James Mark Baldwin, has experienced a revival over the last few decades, driven primarily by some cognitive scientists who think it might be able to solve problems related to the evolution of consciousness. Baldwin's own interests when he developed the theory, which he called "" organic selection,"" were somewhat different from those of modern cognitivists, and his social context was enormously different. This chapter aims to recover the social challenges of Baldwin's time and explore how they might have been related to his proposal. Chief among these challenges was the widespread perception in the United States that the massive immigrant slums in New York and other cities posed a kind of existential threat to the American way of life. This perception, in turn, led to a number of radical and disturbing eugenic proposals for meeting the "" immigrant problem."" It is suggested here that, although Baldwin did not address the immigrant issue directly, it was in his mind as he developed his theory of "" organic selection,"" and also that it offered a way out of the crisis that many Americans thought they then faced.","Green, Christopher D.",0,,2203
2245,Between punishment and discipline: comparing strategies to control unauthorized immigration in the United States,"Immigration scholars have noted the rise of a distinctive discourse concerning immigrants in the United States. The 'immigrant threat' discourse is said to portray immigrants as an existential threat to the country and contributes to highly restrictive enforcement policies. Through a close examination of national political debates concerning comprehensive immigration reform({CIR}) (2005-2007), the paper shows that most politicians involved in this debate (from liberal Democrats to conservative Republicans) agreed with the basic assumptions of this general discourse. But the paper also identifies important variants on the 'threat' discourse and associated strategies. Hardline conservatives stressed that the essential 'illegalness' of immigrants posed a threat to the country. Protecting the nation state from this threat required policies to totally banish all undocumented immigrants from the country, irrespective of their 'good' conduct or exceptional circumstances. Moderate and liberal reform advocates agreed with the idea that undocumented immigrants posed a threat to the country. However, they believed that banishment alone could not address the threat. Instead they advocated a strategy of risk management whereby the population would be differentiated according to levels of risk (high to low priority) and policies of inclusion and exclusion would be adjusted accordingly. This would allow the government to incorporate low risk/priority immigrants while freeing government resources to target the 'truly threatening' groups (i.e., criminals, delinquents, homeless, repeat unauthorized entries, etc.). Thus, while both sides conceded that undocumented immigrants were a threat to the country, they developed important variants on the discourse and contrasting policy solutions to exert control over the population.","Nicholls, Walter",0,,2204
2246,Ninety-Eight Atheists: Atheism among the Non-Elite in Twentieth Century Britain,"Widespread atheism in the general population is one of the defining characteristics of twentieth-century British society, yet until very recently, it has largely been unregarded by historians. This study attempts to contribute to the remedy of this omission by considering autobiographies and oral histories of non-elite atheists between 1890 and 1980. It shows that atheisation (the transition from religious belief to atheism) is principally a phenomenon of childhood and adolescence, with 80\% of the sources becoming atheist by the age of twenty. The reasons the subjects gave for their irreligion were varied, of greatest significance were nearly two thirds who regarded religion as irrelevant to their lives, showing a lack of engagement with religion, its concepts and rituals. Many of these were from weakly religious or irreligious backgrounds who experienced 'irreligious socialisation', rendering religion irrelevant and contributed significantly to the progress of atheisation. Religious trauma, criticism of religion, personal trauma, radical politics, and rationalism accounted for similar proportions of reasons, and were mentioned by only 12-18\% of sources. The potential influence of parental attitude to religion, other childhood experiences, religious education, reducing existential threat, historic events, and the social revolution of the 1960s are also considered as 'unarticulated causes' of the subjects' irreligion.","Sheard, Matt",0,,2205
2247,Non-conscious neural regulation against mortality concerns,"Social psychological studies have shown that an experience of threat such as an encounter with death-related stimuli and social exclusion results in tuning toward positive emotional information. Neuroimaging studies have also begun to uncover the neural basis of threat coping, and in this literature, the activity of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({rVLPFC}) has been suggested to play a key role in detection and regulation of threats. Using near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS}), we examined the activity of {rVLPFC} while participants were subliminally primed with the concept of ""death"" or the control concept ""pain"". We found greater {rVLPFC} activities relative to the prior baseline in the death prime condition, and furthermore, these activities negatively correlated with the evaluation of the positive (but not negative) essay. These data provide initial evidence to suggest that lesser neuronal regulation of threat, when it is first encountered, may lead to subsequent regulation by affect tuning.

2248,"Who Cries Wolf, and When? Manipulation of Perceived Threats to Preserve Rank in Cooperative Groups","People perform greater within-group cooperation when their groups face external threats, such as hostile outgroups or natural disasters. Researchers and social commentators suggest that high-ranking group members manipulate this ""threatdependent'' cooperation by exaggerating threats in order to promote cooperation and suppress competition for their position. However, little systematic research tests this claim or possible situational moderators. In three studies, we use a cooperative group game to show that participants pay to increase others' perceptions of group threats, and spend more on manipulation when holding privileged positions. This manipulation cost-effectively elicits cooperation and sustains privilege, and is fostered by competition over position, not only position per se. Less cooperative people do more manipulation than more cooperative people do. Furthermore, these effects generalize to broader definitions of privilege. Conceptually, these results offer new insights into an understudied dimension of group behavior. Methodologically, the research extends cooperative group games to allow for analyzing more complex group dynamics.","Barclay, Pat and Benard, Stephen",0,,2207

2250,From bombs to bytes: Can our nuclear history inform our cyber future?,"In this essay, the author argues that cyber war does not pose the existential threat to humanity that nuclear weapons do. Still, some experts have called for cyber arms control negotiations and formal treaties. Differences in cultural norms and verification difficulties make such treaties hard to negotiate. International talks and cooperation might, however, develop rough rules of the roadanalogous to those developed for nuclear weapons early in the Cold Warthat can limit cyber conflict. The most promising early areas for international cyber cooperation are probably not bilateral conflicts but problems posed by third parties such as criminals and terrorists. It is likely, the author contends, that major governments will eventually give higher priority to cooperation that works against the insecurity created by non-state actors with cyber weaponry. But the world is far from such a response at this stage of cyber development, just as the major powers did not begin such cooperation on nuclear weapons until the third decade of the nuclear era.","Nye, Joseph S.",0,,2209
2251,Culture and its neurofunctional correlates when death is in mind,The human fear of death is marked by specific psychological reactions that affirm cultural belonging. Terror management theory explains this phenomenon with the symbolic immortality provided by collective meaning in culture. This coping has also been explained with the motive of maintaining a meaningful representation of the world. Here we show that neural patterns of activations corresponding to cultural worldview defense processes differed when images that affirmed participants' cultural heritage were preceded by death-related verbal primes versus verbal primes threatening meaning. Cultural content was drawn upon distinctly on a neural basis when facing death-related cognitions. The neural representation of cultural coping sheds light on the immediate mechanisms in compensating the human fear of death. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2252,Donative behavior at the end of life,"A general finding in the empirical literature on charitable giving is that among older individuals, both the probability of giving and the conditional amount of donations decrease with age, ceteris paribus. In this paper, we use data on giving by alumni at an anonymous university to investigate end-of-life giving patterns. Our main finding is that taking into account the approach of death substantially changes the age-giving profile for the elderly-in one segment of the age distribution, the independent effect of an increase in age on giving actually changes from negative to positive. We examine how the decline in giving as death approaches varies with the length of time that a given condition is likely to bring about death, and the individual's age when he died. We find that for individuals who died from conditions that bring about death fairly quickly, there is little decline in giving as death approaches compared to those who died from other causes. Further, the decline in giving as death approaches is steeper for the elderly (for whom death is less likely to be a surprise) than for the relatively young. These findings suggest that our primary result, that failing to take into account the approach of death leads to biased inferences with respect to the age-giving profile, is not merely an artifact of some kind of nonlinearity in the relationship between age and giving.

2253,The neural basis of social influence and attitude change,"Human attitudes and preferences are susceptible to social influence. Recent social neuroscience studies, using theories and experimental paradigms from social psychology, have begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying how others influence our attitudes through processes such as social conformity, cognitive inconsistency and persuasion. The currently available evidence highlights the role of the posterior medial frontal cortex ({pMFC}) in social conformity and cognitive inconsistency, which represents the discrepancy between one's own and another person's opinion, or, more broadly, between currently inconsistent and ideally consistent states. Research on persuasion has revealed that people's susceptibility to persuasive messages is related to activation in a nearby but more anterior part of the medial frontal cortex. Future progress in this field will depend upon the ability of researchers to dissociate underlying motivations for attitude change in different paradigms, and to utilize neuroimaging methods to advance social psychological theories of social influence.","Izuma, Keise",0,,2212
2254,Transient and sustained neural responses to death-related linguistic cues,"Recent research showed that perception of death-related vs death-unrelated linguistic cues produced increased frontoparietal activity but decreased insular activity. This study investigated (i) whether the increased frontoparietal and decreased insular activities are, respectively, associated with transient trial-specific processes of death-related linguistic cues and sustained death-related thought during death-relevance judgments on linguistic cues and (ii) whether the neural activity underlying death-related thought can predict individuals' dispositional death anxiety. Participants were presented with death-related/unrelated words, life-related/unrelated words, and negative-valence/neutral words in separate sessions. Participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing death-relevance, life-relevance, and valence judgments on the words, respectively. The contrast of death-related vs death-unrelated words during death-relevance judgments revealed transient increased activity in the left inferior parietal lobule, the right frontal eye field, and the right superior parietal lobule. The contrast of death-relevance judgments vs life-relevance/valence judgments showed decreased activity in the bilateral insula. The sustained insular activity was correlated with dispositional death anxiety, but only in those with weak transient frontoparietal responses to death-related words. Our results dissociate the transient and sustained neural responses to death-related linguistic cues and suggest that the combination of the transient and sustained neural activities can predict dispositional death anxiety.","Shi, Zhenhao and Han, Shihui",0,,2213

In an effort to provide an up-to-date synthesis of the experimental findings, meta-analytic techniques were employed to examine the impact of threat-based messages on fear arousal and on lab-based indices of driving behavior. Experimental studies (k = 13, N = 3044), conducted between 1990 and 2011, were included in the analyses. The aims of the current analysis were (a) to examine whether or not the experimental manipulations had a significant impact on evoked fear, (b) to examine the impact of threat appeals on three distinct indices of driving, and (c) to identify moderators and mediators of the relationship between fear and driving outcomes. Large effects emerged for the level of fear evoked, with experimental groups reporting increased fear arousal in comparison to control groups (r = .64, n = 619, p {\textless} .01). The effect of threat appeals on driving outcomes, however, was not significant (r = .03, p = .17). This analysis of the experimental literature indicates that threat appeals can lead to increased fear arousal, but do not appear to have the desired impact on driving behavior. We discuss these findings in the context of threat-based road safety campaigns and future directions for experimental research in this area.","Carey, Rachel N. and {McDermott}, Daragh T. and Sarma, Kiran M.",0,,2214
2256,4D Imaging of Protein Aggregation in Live Cells,"One of the key tasks of any living cell is maintaining the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins in the face of ever-changing environmental conditions and an intracellular environment that is tightly packed, sticky, and hazardous to protein stability(1). The ability to dynamically balance protein production, folding and degradation demands highly-specialized quality control machinery, whose absolute necessity is observed best when it malfunctions. Diseases such as {ALS}, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and certain forms of Cystic Fibrosis have a direct link to protein folding quality control components(2), and therefore future therapeutic development requires a basic understanding of underlying processes. Our experimental challenge is to understand how cells integrate damage signals and mount responses that are tailored to diverse circumstances. The primary reason why protein misfolding represents an existential threat to the cell is the propensity of incorrectly folded proteins to aggregate, thus causing a global perturbation of the crowded and delicate intracellular folding environment(1). The folding health, or ""proteostasis,"" of the cellular proteome is maintained, even under the duress of aging, stress and oxidative damage, by the coordinated action of different mechanistic units in an elaborate quality control system(3,4). A specialized machinery of molecular chaperones can bind non-native polypeptides and promote their folding into the native state(1), target them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system(5), or direct them to protective aggregation inclusions(6-9). In eukaryotes, the cytosolic aggregation quality control load is partitioned between two compartments(8-10): the juxtanuclear quality control compartment ({JUNQ}) and the insoluble protein deposit ({IPOD}) (Figure 1 - model). Proteins that are ubiquitinated by the protein folding quality control machinery are delivered to the {JUNQ}, where they are processed for degradation by the proteasome. Misfolded proteins that are not ubiquitinated are diverted to the {IPOD}, where they are actively aggregated in a protective compartment. Up until this point, the methodological paradigm of live-cell fluorescence microscopy has largely been to label proteins and track their locations in the cell at specific time-points and usually in two dimensions. As new technologies have begun to grant experimenters unprecedented access to the submicron scale in living cells, the dynamic architecture of the cytosol has come into view as a challenging new frontier for experimental characterization. We present a method for rapidly monitoring the 3D spatial distributions of multiple fluorescently labeled proteins in the yeast cytosol over time. 3D timelapse (4D imaging) is not merely a technical challenge; rather, it also facilitates a dramatic shift in the conceptual framework used to analyze cellular structure. We utilize a cytosolic folding sensor protein in live yeast to visualize distinct fates for misfolded proteins in cellular aggregation quality control, using rapid 4D fluorescent imaging. The temperature sensitive mutant of the Ubc9 protein(10-12) (Ubc9(ts)) is extremely effective both as a sensor of cellular proteostasis, and a physiological model for tracking aggregation quality control. As with most ts proteins, Ubc9(ts) is fully folded and functional at permissive temperatures due to active cellular chaperones. Above 30 degrees C, or when the cell faces misfolding stress, Ubc9(ts) misfolds and follows the fate of a native globular protein that has been misfolded due to mutation, heat denaturation, or oxidative damage. By fusing it to {GFP} or other fluorophores, it can be tracked in 3D as it forms Stress Foci, or is directed to {JUNQ} or {IPOD}.","Spokoini, Rachel and Shamir, Maya and Keness, Alma and Kaganovich, Daniel",0,,2215
2257,Self-control and the fear of death among adolescents in Hong Kong,"The fear of death, as one of the death attitude dimensions, is heavily studied. However, the potential influence of self-control on the fear of death is scarcely examined. Previous literature implies that self-control may be an influential element in determining the magnitude of the fear of death. However, no study, especially in the Asia region, has attempted to directly examine this relationship. Thus, the current study is among the first to investigate the effects of self-control on death fear in a group of Hong Kong adolescents. Gendered analyses, with and without being divided into different age groups, are performed. The exploration of the moderating impact of religious beliefs on self-control in influencing the fear of death is also examined. Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 1377 native Chinese secondary school-aged male and female adolescents of nine schools are surveyed. Overall, findings suggest that self-control is negatively correlated with the fear of death. Specifically, regression findings indicate that the decrease in self-control, as measured by different low self-control indicators across gender and age, is likely to increase the level of fear of death. Interestingly, findings signify that religiosity has a moderating impact on self-control in determining the level of death fear. On the whole, this study suggests that self-control plays a vital role in determining the level of fear of death among adolescents in Hong Kong. Potential caveats, future directions, and implications of the findings are addressed.","Chui, Wing Hong and Chan, Heng Choon",0,,2216

The model, including all participants, fitted well to the data. The results suggested that the relationship of collective self-esteem to happiness was fully mediated by personal self-esteem, whereas a partial mediation was the case for life satisfaction. When tested in four groups of attachment styles, however, the results indicated a full mediation for fearful, preoccupied and dismissing groups, but a partial mediation for the secure group. The results are discussed in the ""pursuing self-esteem"" framework.","Simsek, Omer Faruk",0,,2217
2259,Religiosity and fear of death: a three-nation comparison,"Numerous studies have sought to determine if religiosity is correlated with fear of death. Findings have been anything but consistent, with reports of negative relationships, positive relationships, no relationship, and even curvilinear associations. To shed light on this still contentious issue, the present study was undertaken among college students in three countries - Malaysia, Turkey, and the United States. Overall, the patterns in all three countries were similar. When linearity was assumed, there is a substantial positive correlation between most religiosity measures and fear of death. Assuming curvilinearity added slightly to the strength of the relationships in the {US} data and nothing to data from Malaysia or Turkey. Other findings were that on average females were more religious and feared death more than did males, and Muslims expressed considerably greater fear than did members of any other major religion. Results were discussed in the context of a new theory - called death apprehension theory. Among other things, it specifically predicts that death apprehension will be positively related to most religious beliefs and practices.","Ellis, Lee and Wahab, Eshah A. and Ratnasingan, Malini",0,,2218
2260,{THE} {VITAL} {AND} {EXISTENTIAL} {NATURE} {OF} {THE} {EMERGENCY},"The article deals with the problem of defining the essence of the phenomenon of an emergency. The author considers its main characteristics: the vital threat as a threat to the physical existence of an individual and existential, which manifests itself in the form of threat to the further existence of a man. The performed analysis suggests that an emergency is extremely negative content. It is an ordeal for a man. Emergency affects the physical and mental condition of a person, as well as the values and aspirations of an individual. It is noted that an emergency first touches the need for human security. The victim feels vital threat because of injuries, wounds or through an awareness of what could happen. Among the existential human needs there are the following: the need to establish relationships, the need to overcome, the need for identity, the need for belief system. An overview of human's state and reactions, which are caused by the nature of threat of an emergency is provided. It is identified that such events are not only a source of stress for people, but also can be a reason of serious changes in their lives.","Onishchenko, N. V.",0,,2219
2261,The salience of existential concerns across the cancer control continuum,"Despite significant improvement in cancer survival, the fear of death still remains rooted in individuals' beliefs about cancer. Existential fears pertaining to cancer cut across the cancer control continuum and taint decisions related to prevention, screening, surveillance, and follow-up recommendations, as well as the overall management of cancer-related issues. However, individuals are innately predisposed to cope with their cancer-related fears through mechanisms such as reliance on the process of meaning making. To better appreciate the potential impact of existential concerns across the cancer control continuum, the Temporal Existential Awareness and Meaning Making ({TEAMM}) model is proposed. This tripartite model depicts three types of perceived threats to life related to cancer including a ""social awareness"" (i.e., cancer signals death), ""personalized awareness"" (i.e., I could die from cancer), and the ""lived experience"" (i.e., It feels like I am dying from cancer). This construal aims to enhance our understanding of the personal and contextual resources that can be mobilized to manage existential concerns and optimize cancer control efforts. As such, existential discussions should be considered in any cancer-related supportive approach whether preventive, curative, or palliative, and not be deferred only until the advanced stages of cancer or at end of life. Further delineation and validation of the model is needed to explicitly recognize and depict how different levels of existential awareness might unfold as individuals grapple with a potential, actual, or recurrent cancer.","Lee, Virginia and Loiselle, Carmen G.",0,,2220
2262,Bereavement and Anxiety,"Bereavement, one of life's most difficult experiences, usually triggers acute grief with yearning and longing for the deceased person that is often intense and preoccupying, along with frequent thoughts and memories of the person who died and relatively little interest in anything unrelated to the deceased loved one. Anxiety is a very common feature of grief that is often neglected. Anxiety is a natural response of the attachment system to separation from a loved one, seen in adults as well as children. Confrontation with one's own death is also a natural trigger of anxiety, though we usually protect ourselves from mortality salience using terror management strategies related to cultural values and self-esteem. In addition, loss of a loved one can trigger the onset of a anxiety disorder that, when present, can derail the mourning process and prolong acute grief. Bereavement-related anxiety disorders need to be recognized and treated.","Shear, M. Katherine and Skritskaya, Natalia A.",0,,2221
2263,{THE} {BIN} {LADEN} {EXCEPTION},"Osama bin Laden's demise provides an opportune moment to reevaluate the extraordinary measures taken by the U. S. government in the ""war on terror,"" with any reassessment incorporating the threat posed by al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Some modest analysis suggests that terrorism remains a miniscule risk for the average American, and it hardly poses an existential threat to the United States. Nonetheless, terrorism-related fears have distorted the people's risk perception and facilitated dubious public policies, exemplified here by a series of programs implemented by the Transportation Security Administration ({TSA}). Among other things, this agency has adopted costly technology and intrusive pat downs to screen airline passengers with little evidence that the terrorist risk has been meaningfully and efficiently reduced as a result. The {TSA} regime also clashes with core constitutional values and decent understandings of the Fourth Amendment. To date, however, the courts have been deferential to the government. Although the decisions rehearse established exceptions, they are indicative of an entirely new constitutional exception grounded in irrational fears of terrorism.","Luna, Erik",0,,2222
2264,"{THE} {DELTA} {CREEKS}, {WOMEN}'S {ENGAGEMENT} {AND} {NIGERIA}'S {OIL} {INSURGENCY}","The on-going insurgency in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria continues to have serious consequences for oil workers, corporations and the global oil market. In spite of the growing interest in arguably the greatest existential threat to the Nigerian state since the Civil War of 1967-70, scant scholarly attention has been paid to the Delta creeks and the fundamental roles performed by women in the insurgency. This paper interrogates the space represented by the creeks as the home territory of insurgents in Nigeria's oil-rich Delta. Using interview and focus group data garnered from 42 insurgents and five other sets of actors, I analyse the operational significance and symbolism of the creeks and its processual social sorting. In addition, I demonstrate the dichotomous relationship of women to the creeks. Women constitute a major source of reconnaissance, spiritual fortification, among other roles, but are concurrently considered eewo or abomination by male insurgents. Although academic analysis has been overwhelmingly concerned with the supportive roles and nonviolent protests of women, the Delta women are actively engaged in the on-going violent repertoires of protest.","Oriola, Temitope",0,,2223
2265,Third party responses to justice failure: An identity-based meaning maintenance model,"We propose a model that explores the consequences of justice failure. We conceptualize justice failure as a threat to meaning and suggest belief in a just world and justice climate as two moderators for the proposed relationship. We propose that individuals react to justice failure by engaging in fluid compensation and that third parties are more likely than victims of justice failure to engage in this process. We further propose that identity influences individuals' reaction to justice failure such that individuals high in moral identity are more likely to affirm their moral domain than other domains. As a result of fluid compensation, we finally propose that individuals who affirm their moral domain are (a) more likely to act morally and less likely to act immorally (b) more punitive towards others who violate social norms and (c) more supportive of corporate social responsibility programs. Implications and future research directions are discussed.","Zhu, Luke and Martens, Jason P. and Aquino, Karl",0,,2224
2266,Storm Hazard and Slavery: The Impact of the 1831 Great Caribbean Hurricane on St Vincent,"On 11 August 1831, St Vincent was struck by the Great Caribbean Hurricane. Ninety-two out of 96 sugar estates on the island experienced damage to buildings and crops. Destruction varied, however, according to location and the type of structure at risk. Worst affected were the northerly regions of St David and Charlotte's parishes, while slave villages suffered more than mill works or great houses. As a result of the storm the colony's exports fell by nearly 50 per cent, reflecting disruption to the infrastructure supporting overseas trade as well as a sugar crop shortfall of more than 25 per cent. In contrast to the hazard's large impact on plantation agriculture, relatively few casualties occurred. St Vincent also suffered less acutely than Barbados, a similar sized island, equally dependent on sugar and slavery. A plausible explanation for the hurricane's differential impact between the two colonies lies in localised vulnerability of place. While the enslaved population did not take advantage of the disaster to mount a challenge to white authority, shortages of provisions and timber strained relations on some estates. St Vincent's plantation economy, however, recovered relatively quickly, demonstrating considerable disaster resilience. Although slaves and the free black and mixed-race population received little direct government support, grant-in-aid was allocated to agents primarily responsible for coordinating supplies of food, clothing and shelter. The speed of recovery questions whether natural disasters weakened planter resistance to emancipation across the British West Indies. Conceptualisation of the Great Caribbean Hurricane as an existential threat to British colonies also obscures the extent to which responses to climatic hazard were shaped by the imperial relationship and the interests of largely absentee owners.","Smith, S.

2267,Unsatisfactory Narration or the Narrative Mediation of Atrocious Presence? Narratives of Jewish Survivors of National Socialist Concentration Camps,"Someone who experiences a severe car crash, an assault on life and limb, or a natural disaster finds himself at the mercy of a series of events in which he is stripped of his ability to act and regulate what happens; in which measures of self-protection, flight, and defence have no effect; and in which physical, social, or psychological integrity is threatened. Situations of this kind should be seen as traumatic in the traditional sense of the word: they cause a wound, damage to tissue, a physical or mental injury. Traumatic impairment brings about a temporary decrease in physical, social, or psychological functionality, or leads to decompensation. The decreased functionality or the process of decompensation can also affect spatio-temporal, relational and situational orientation. The affected person is then subsequently unable to reconstruct the traumatic events adequately. This is one of the reasons that suggest that traumatic experiences cannot be adequately narratively represented in retrospect. Certain details of the intrusive events, though, are, according to psychophysiology and brain research, preserved in body memory - particularly sensations and individual perceptual impressions. Thus, there can emerge a reconstruction of the experience that is characterized by ruptures, breaks and gaps, a loosely connected profusion of details, fragmentation, or the style of an impersonal report, the latter being particularly likely when the process of remembering becomes emotionally overwhelming. It is not clear whether the features of formulation and representation mentioned here will prove to be trauma-specific or apply also to other processes of reconstruction involving what is hard to represent and to other forms of emotional overwhelming such as extreme surprise, joy, and pride, as well as, for example, horror at one's own actions. Someone who is, as victim or witness, caught up in devastating violence needs the subsequent restoration of damaged integrity; every wound requires a subsequent healing process. For many people, this is achieved swiftly and completely; others are burdened with lasting psychological impairments. These patients have not only had a traumatic experience in the traditional sense of the word; they are considered traumatized or are officially diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The question of the risk of being affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and what aspects of personality or what pre-existent factors increase or reduce this risk has not yet been resolved; the same is true of the question of an individual's traumatization threshold. It is not possible to make a general statement about what threatening encounters are accompanied by what risk of destabilization and dys-functionality for whom. Narrating in retrospect about destructive, disturbing, intrusive events that have been endured is felt to be a major challenge, if not to say too much of one, for those affected. According to psychiatric and psychotherapeutic knowledge, the narrative mediation of these events is usually unsatisfactory. There are numerous questions that remain open in relation to this. How does this relate to processes involving the orientation and memory functions? Is this state of affairs part of the way that post-traumatic stress disorder presents itself, or can it be observed independently of it? Is narrative presentation dependent on the circumstances of communication, on situation and context? On writing as distinct from orality? Is it dependent on the content of the event? On collectivity as distinct from the exceptional character of the destructive events that were suffered? Are humiliating and embarrassing experiences, for example, particularly hard to relate? When is it a case of a lack of narrative competence, when of an unwillingness to narrate? What roles are played by the temporal proximity and temporal distance of events? Have the norms of unsatisfactory narration been well substantiated? From a psychiatric or psychological perspective, lack of coherence is usually considered a sign of insufficient narrative organization, yet the terminological description for diagnostic purposes is in most cases only a superficiality. The implicit reference to a normative model of narrative, moreover, obscures the potential creativity and special expressiveness of narrating about potentially traumatizing occurrences. These questions require intensive further research in an interdisciplinary context. Everyday narration is a resource for generating resonance and acceptance. Successful narrative communication allows one's own interests and desires to be represented and past things to be brought to life before a sympathetic social other. Everyday narration brings context, incisiveness and structure, the construction of a plot, and a flow based on tension. Is this not the case with traumatic experiences? Are experiences of an extreme nature, for example those of victims of National Socialist violence and imprisonment, not or not as much characterized on an oral level by shape, incisiveness, and narrative flow, as well as an intense emotional involvement - as is the case in the narrative representation of events from an everyday life that is not subject to an existential threat? Can survivors of the National Socialist camps establish a personal frame of reference when they narrate? While autobiographical narration in an everyday situation in medical and psychological contexts seems well suited to introducing a personal perspective, it is not clear whether concentration camp survivors identify with the represented I when they narrate, whether they can engage in the direction of a narrative and the shaping of roles in it, whether they expect and are able to cope with sympathy and empathy. Trauma research tends to deny this. Our narrative analysis of audio recordings of interviews with survivors of National Socialist concentration camps leads to the opposite result. The narrated episodes about devastating experiences all have features of moulded and incisive narration - for example, a flow of progression with a marked beginning and a marked end, the representation of individual specific episodic events as perfectly valid narrative progressions, the relation of dialogue scenes in direct speech with the corresponding vocal and prosodic form. We explore processes of narrative representation with reference to this particular narrative corpus. The narrating individuals have not been diagnosed with stress disorders. They are consistently of a considerable age and do not exhibit any cognitive or affective limitations. The narratives concern events that took place a long time ago in their lives, events that struck people who were, in the context of National Socialist racial persecution, hunted down, deported, interned, tortured, and subjected to systematic killing. What we have are the experiences of a collective persecuted in the unjust regime of National Socialism. Former Jewish prisoners in National Socialist concentration camps agreed to be interviewed as witnesses for the Archive of Memory (the material is in the Moses Mendelssohn Center, Potsdam); looking back on their lives in retrospect, they orally describe catastrophic experiences of danger, violence, and deprivation. Alongside individual, narrator-specific linguistic forms, many narratives, which we found in ten recordings from the Moses Mendelssohn Center's Archive of Memory, each several hours long, display overarching features of composition that produce a substantial narrative flow of dreadful submission, deadly threat, and rescue. This contrasts with the unnarratability identified in linguistic analysis, and whose plausibility is supported by neuropsychology, and the circular and fragmentary linguistic patterns that are supposed to be characteristic of the communication of experiences of threat and violence, in particular in the context of imprisonment and internment. We found not unsatisfactory narrativity, but a multifaceted flow of evocative presence and descriptive distance, immediate manner and historicizing separation, with a distinctive reference to listeners or interaction. Negative experiences of an extreme nature can be narratable - in an elaborate fully constructed and incisive mode of narration as a form of informative self-expression and self-positioning in social space.","Boothe, Brigitte and Thoma, Gisela",0,,2226
2268,Attitudes toward people with disabilities caused by illness or injury: beyond physical impairment,"This study examined differences in attitudes toward and reactions to individuals with comparable disabilities caused by injury or illness. Participants were students and healthcare professionals randomly assigned to read one of eight vignettes constructed in a between-subjects, full-factorial design: 2 (illness/injury) x 2 (male/female) x 2 (visible/not visible). Participants completed questionnaires measuring reactions to the target person and attitudes toward people with disabilities. We found that both students and healthcare professionals expressed more positive attitudes toward persons with injury-related compared with illness-related disabilities, but that these differences were typically not expressed in reported social encounters with individual disabled persons. The effects of the illness-injury distinction were moderated by sex only among students, with the highest distancing reported from a female with an illness-related disability. Visibility of the disability triggered more social distancing among students, regardless of the injury-illness distinction. We concluded that the illness-injury distinction is a socially and psychologically significant factor.","Shiloh, Shoshana and Heruti, Irit and Berkovitz, Tamar",0,,2227

The paper describes an experiment in which participants were exposed to mortality salient or neutral facts. The dependent variable was self-reported intention to take driving risks. Participants (n=80) were male university students with a full driver's licence. Participants with high driving-related self-esteem, who were exposed to deathrelated facts and images, reported greater intentions to take driving risks than those exposed to neutral information. Impulsiveness was identified as a significant contributor to risky driving intentions. Though limited in its ecological validity, the study presents an opportunity to reconsider our understanding of resilience to driving-related health promotion campaigns.","Carey, R. N. and Sarma, K.

According to the results of both studies, the four {PPT} aspects were strongly intercorrelated; loaded on a higher order common factor; were associated with psychological symptoms, life satisfaction and stress-related evaluations (i.e. stressfulness of the condition, self-efficacy, social support) and mediated the relation of stress-related evaluations to psychological symptoms in an equivalent way.

2272,Can securitization theory be used in normative analysis? Towards a just securitization theory,"While securitization studies have paid considerable attention to the moral value of desecuritization, they have paid almost no attention to the morality of securitization. In this article, I attempt to rectify that situation by proposing a revision of securitization theory that specifies three criteria that - if fulfilled at the same time - would render a securitization morally right. The criteria are: (1) that there is an objective existential threat; (2) that the referent object of security is morally legitimate; and (3) that the security response is appropriate to the threat in question. Although what is suggested here is considerably removed from the Copenhagen School's original securitization theory, it is akin to that framework insofar as it retains the functional distinction between the security analyst and the securitizing actor. Indeed, the development of criteria that determine the moral rightness of securitization is analogous to the Copenhagen School's devising criteria that determine both the existence and the success of securitization.","Floyd, Rita",0,,2231
2273,Death and Science: The Existential Underpinnings of Belief in Intelligent Design and Discomfort with Evolution,"The present research examined the psychological motives underlying widespread support for intelligent design theory ({IDT}), a purportedly scientific theory that lacks any scientific evidence; and antagonism toward evolutionary theory ({ET}), a theory supported by a large body of scientific evidence. We tested whether these attitudes are influenced by {IDT}'s provision of an explanation of life's origins that better addresses existential concerns than {ET}. In four studies, existential threat (induced via reminders of participants' own mortality) increased acceptance of {IDT} and/or rejection of {ET}, regardless of participants' religion, religiosity, educational background, or preexisting attitude toward evolution. Effects were reversed by teaching participants that naturalism can be a source of existential meaning (Study 4), and among natural-science students for whom {ET} may already provide existential meaning (Study 5). These reversals suggest that the effect of heightened mortality awareness on attitudes toward {ET} and {IDT} is due to a desire to find greater meaning and purpose in science when existential threats are activated.","Tracy, Jessica L. and Hart, Joshua and Martens, Jason P.",1,,2232
2274,Terror management in times of war: Mortality salience effects on self-esteem and governmental and army support,"Previous research has identified economic and political factors that can contribute to the outbreak and the duration of armed conflicts. However, the psychological factors that may play a role in conflict escalation and duration have received less attention. Adopting a psychological perspective, the present study aims to investigate the role of death awareness in the context of an armed conflict. To this aim, basic assumptions derived from Terror Management Theory ({TMT}) were examined in an African civil war context. According to {TMT}, people manage awareness of inevitable death by increased striving for self-esteem and increased adherence to their cultural values. Students from the University of Abidjan (Ivory Coast), located in the pro-governmental part of the country, were randomly assigned to a mortality salience or a control condition and completed measures of self-esteem and government/army support. As expected, reminding participants of their possible death during the ongoing conflict exacerbated self-esteem, as well as support for the actions of the government and its army, compared to a control condition. Given that mortality is chronically salient in the context of a civil war, these effects can lead to conflict intensification by increasing not only each side's support for their leaders, but also the value that members of confronted sides attribute to themselves. The findings are discussed in terms of the role of mortality salience in conflict escalation and the importance of carefully dealing with the past in post-conflict societies.","Chatard, Arm and  and Selimbegovic, Leila and Konan, Paul N'Dri and Arndt, Jamie and Pyszczynski, Tom and Lorenzi-Cioldi, Fabio and Van der Linden, Martial",1,,2233
2275,The role of mechanisms of buffering anxiety in {HIV} carriers. A study within the terror management theory paradigm,"Introduction: The paper concerns definition of the level of posttraumatic growth ({PTG}), the psychological adaptation mechanism occurring after extreme experiences in life, such as being informed of having {HIV} infection. Aim: The study is experimental, aiming to assess whether correlations between exposure to thoughts of stressful experiences and their psychological consequences are mediated by an efficient mechanism of buffering anxiety. Material/Methods: Fifty-four men and 26 women infected with {HIV} who underwent manipulated exposure to mortality according to the hypotheses of the terror management theory ({TMT}) were included. Subjects were randomly assigned to the control group (dental anxiety) or the experimental group (fear of dying). Results: The results confirmed the assumptions of the terror management theory. The subjects had an efficient mechanism of alleviating the fear of dying, the so-called ""anxiety buffer."" The analysis revealed a high level of posttraumatic growth and advantages derived from the disease. The paper additionally characterizes the specific group of {HIV}-positive people, their functioning in society and the family. It touches on such issues as professional work, relations with relatives and friends, social life, and adherence. Conclusions: The study has shown that the specific group of people infected with {HIV} managed very well to adapt to the circumstances. One may say that as a consequence of acquiring the infection, the subjects have experienced significant changes of personality, which have ultimately led to an improvement of their lives and offered new possibilities for personal and social development to them. All the recorded changes fit into the {TMT} paradigm.","Kwiatkowska, Marta and Knysz, Brygida and Gasiorowski, Jacek and Luszczynska, Aleks and ra and Gladysz, Andrzej",0,,2234
2276,How the Politics of Inclusion/Exclusion and the Neuroscience of Dehumanization/Rehumanization Can Contribute to Animal Activists' Strategies: Bestia Sacer {II},"Juxtaposing the continental philosophy of inclusion/exclusion and the cognitive and affective neuroscience of dehumanization, infrahumanization, and rehumanization may inform animal activists' strategies. Both fields focus upon how we decide who counts and who doesn't. Decisions over who's human (or like us) and who isn't (i.e., who's an animal, or not like us) are not simply about species membership but involve biopolitical value judgments over who we wish to include or exclude. Posthumanists seek to disrupt the biopolitics of inclusion/exclusion, partly to heal ethical and political relations between human and nonhuman animals. Calarco calls this jamming Agamben's anthropological machine. Bestia sacer are those designated as included or excluded, moving among zones of humans, nonhuman animals, and things. Cognitive and affective neuroscience describes how mechanisms of inclusion/exclusion function in dehumanization, infrahumanization, and rehumanization. Humans assign varying degrees of humanity to others according to in-group/out-group status in judgments open to manipulation. Investigating how these mechanisms operate in human perceptions of nonhuman animals may inform activist strategies, transforming ethical and political relations between humans and nonhuman animals and end the exclusion of bestia sacer.","Mackenzie, Robin",0,,2235
2277,Side of onset in Parkinson's disease and alterations in religiosity: Novel behavioral phenotypes,"Behavioral neurologists have long been interested in changes in religiosity following circumscribed brain lesions. Advances in neuroimaging and cognitive experimental techniques have been added to these classical lesion-correlational approaches in attempt to understand changes in religiosity due to brain damage. In this paper we assess processing dynamics of religious cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}). We administered a four-condition story-based priming procedure, and then covertly probed for changes in religious belief. Story-based priming emphasized mortality salience, religious ritual, and beauty in nature (Aesthetic). In neurologically intact controls, religious belief-scores significantly increased following the Aesthetic prime condition. When comparing effects of right ({RO}) versus left onset ({LO}) in {PI}) patients, a double-dissociation in religious belief-scores emerged based on prime condition. {RO} patients exhibited a significant increase in belief following the Aesthetic prime condition and {LO} patients significantly increased belief in the religious ritual prime condition. Results covaried with executive function measures. This suggests lateral cerebral specialization for ritual-based (left frontal) versus aesthetic-based (right frontal) religious cognition. Patient-centered individualized treatment plans should take religiosity into consideration as a complex disease-associated phenomenon connected to other clinical variables and health outcomes.","Butler, Paul M. and {McNamara}, Patrick and Durso, Raymon",0,,2236
2279,Descriptive Norms as Carriers of Culture in Negotiation,"Research on culture and negotiation is critical for expanding theories of negotiation beyond Western cultures and for helping people to manage their interdependence in a world of increasing global threats and opportunities. Despite progress of understanding cultural influences on negotiation, research is limited in that it portrays a static and decontextualized view of culture and ignores cultural dynamics. The almost exclusive focus on main effects of culture in negotiation has its roots in a subjectivist approach to culture which has prioritized the study of values, or trans-situational goals. In this article, we discuss the descriptive norms approach to culture and its promise for the study of culture and negotiation. A descriptive norms approach highlights the dynamics of culture in negotiation (i.e., the conditions under which culture effects become amplified, reduced, or even reversed), it identifies new empirical mediating mechanisms for cultural effects, and it sheds new light into understanding cultural competence in intercultural negotiations.","Gelf and , Michele J. and Lun, Janetta and Lyons, Sarah and Shteynberg, Garriy",0,,2237
2281,Survival Migration: A New Protection Framework,"The modern refugee regime, created in the aftermath of World War {II}, provides protection mainly to people who flee individualized persecution or generalized violence. Subsequent to its creation, a range of new drivers of external displacement particularly related to the interaction of environmental change, livelihood collapse, and state fragility have emerged that fall outside the framework of the regime. In order to examine institutional responses to these people, this article develops the concept of survival migration, which describes people who have left their country of origin because of an existential threat for which they have no domestic remedy. It examines six case studies of national and international institutional responses to survival migrants from Zimbabwe, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo ({DRC}), which fall outside the 1951 Refugee Convention. Based on a conceptual model of regime stretching, the article offers an explanation for variation in the extent to which the existing global regime has adapted to address survival migration in different national contexts.","Betts, Alex and er",0,,2238
2282,When Corrections Fail: The Persistence of Political Misperceptions,"An extensive literature addresses citizen ignorance, but very little research focuses on misperceptions. Can these false or unsubstantiated beliefs about politics be corrected? Previous studies have not tested the efficacy of corrections in a realistic format. We conducted four experiments in which subjects read mock news articles that included either a misleading claim from a politician, or a misleading claim and a correction. Results indicate that corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group. We also document several instances of a ""backfire effect"" in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.","Nyhan, Brendan and Reifler, Jason",0,,2239
2283,Angels in Digital Armor: Technoculture and Terror Management,"O'Gorman is particularly interested in the relationship between death and technology, an area of research that he has dubbed ""necromedia."" This essay adopts Ernest Becker's conception of culture as a ""hero system"" that fulfills two primary existential needs: 1) the denial of death, and 2) the desire for recognition. By crossing Becker's work with the theories of Bernard Stiegler, Martin Heidegger, and Alexandre Kojeve, the essay applies this notion of a cultural hero system toward a more contemporary analysis of technoculture. The role of media technologies in such tragic events as the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings and in the ""death by gaming"" trend in South Korea illustrate how technoculture offers a promise of immortality with which other cultural systems (school, religion, family) cannot compete. be observed in everyday life, wherever technology fulfills the desire for recognition and buffers us from the inevitability of death. From popular accounts of the search for an ""immortality gene,"" to the explosive popularity of Facebook and Twitter, technological resources and the rhetorics that promote them have become the existential cornerstone of Western society.","O'Gorman, Marcel",0,,2240
2284,Terror Management Theory in Dermatology: Skin Biopsy Influences Patient Compliance,"A skin biopsy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in the dermatology outpatient clinic, but doctors often do not consider the cognitive impact of the biopsy procedure. Based on ""terror management theory,"" we reasoned that a skin biopsy increases patient compliance by unconsciously stimulating mortality salience. To study this hypothesis, trust toward doctors, authoritarian personality, mood, attitude toward recommendations, and intention to accept recommendations were compared between skin biopsy and non-skin biopsy groups of patients. Eighty-three patients participated in the study, and 78 responses were used for the analysis. The results showed that patients who had a skin biopsy had a more positive attitude toward doctors' recommendations and a higher intention to follow the recommendations. These effects were not moderated by the patient's own personality (patient trust and authoritarian personality). The outcome of this study implies that performing a procedure itself can subliminally influence a patient's attitude toward a doctor's recommendations.","Kim, Jae Hwan and Kim, Joonhwan and Jung, You-Hee and Yi, Youjae and Ahn, Hyo Hyun",0,,2241
2286,Experimental peace psychology: Priming consensus mitigates aggression against outgroups under mortality salience,"The present experiment examined the effects of mortality salience and social consensus on attitudes toward members of an out-group. One-hundred and fifty participants from two universities in Iran took part in a 2 (mortality salience or dental pain) x 3 (social consensus for, consensus against or no information) between-subjects design. Participants were primed with either death or pain, and then read that the majority of Iranians supported martyrdom attacks against the United States, the majority was against these types of attacks or no information was provided. Results indicated that mortality salience led to more support for violence martyrdom attacks in the no information and high social support for martyrdom conditions, but had no effect on support for such attacks when participants were led to believe that most of the people in their country opposed such tactics. Implications for terror management theory and peaceful solutions to intergroup conflict are discussed.","Abdollahi, Abdolhossein and Henthorn, Carl and Pyszczynski, Tom",1,,2242
2287,Integrating psychometric and cultural theory approaches to formulate an alternative measure of risk perception,"Psychometric and cultural theory are key approaches used to explain risk perceptions. However, both approaches explain only 20 and 5-10\% of the variance of risk perceptions, respectively. Through advances in social psychology, terror management theory revealed that certain survey questions used in the psychometric approach primed thoughts of death. Such unintentional priming evoked defense mechanisms that would subconsciously activate participants' cultural biases and values when answering some questions but not others. There are two implications: one, psychometric theorists need to modify their questionnaires to reduce the incidence of priming thoughts of death; and two, integrating the psychometric and cultural theory approaches may potentially explain a higher amount of variance in risk perceptions. Specifically, attitudes (psychometric approach), demographics, affect and past behavior collectively influence cultural biases, which in turn exert an effect on risk perception. However, such a model calls for an appropriate measure of the dynamic nature of cultural biases that current attitudinal measures fall short of. Drawing from methodology within industrial/organizational psychology, the Situational Judgment Test ({SJT}) is proposed as an alternative measure for risk perception. Steps to designing an {SJT} are outlined and followed through to culminate in a 10-item {SJT} that measures cultural biases.","Ng, Reuben and Rayner, Steve",0,,2243

2290,"The People Paradox: Self-Esteem Striving, Immortality Ideologies, and Human Response to Climate Change","In 1973, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist cross-trained in philosophy, sociology, and psychiatry, invoked consciousness of self and the inevitability of death as the primary sources of human anxiety and repression. He proposed that the psychological basis of cooperation, competition, and emotional and mental health is a tendency to hold tightly to anxiety-buffering cultural world views or ""immortality projects"" that serve as the basis for self-esteem and meaning. Although he focused mainly on social and political outcomes like war, torture, and genocide, he was increasingly aware that materialism, denial of nature, and immortality-striving efforts to control, rather than sanctify, the natural world were problems whose severity was increasing. In this paper I review Becker's ideas and suggest ways in which they illuminate human response to global climate change. Because immortality projects range from belief in technology and materialism to reverence for nature or belief in a celestial god, they act both as barriers to and facilitators of sustainable practices. I propose that Becker's cross-disciplinary ""science of man,"" and the predictions it generates for proximate-level determinants of social behavior, add significantly to our understanding of and potential for managing the people paradox, i.e., that the very things that bring us symbolic immortality often conflict with our prospects for survival. Analysis of immortality projects as one of the proximate barriers to addressing climate change is both cautionary and hopeful, providing insights that should be included in the cross-disciplinary quest to uncover new pathways toward rational, social change.","Dickinson, Janis L.",0,,2246
2291,Finding Social Benefits After a Collective Trauma: Perceiving Societal Changes and Well-Being Following 9/11,"Individuals frequently perceive positive changes in themselves following adversity; after a collective trauma, they may perceive such benefits in others or in their society as well. We examined perceived benefits of the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks in a 3-year study of a national sample of adults (N = 1382). Many individuals (57.8\%) perceived social benefits of 9/11, including increased prosocial behavior, religiousness, or political engagement. Individuals who found increased national religiosity as a benefit 2 months post-9/11 reported greater positive affect and life satisfaction and lower distress and posttraumatic stress up to 3 years post-9/11, Pre-9/11, religiousness and Republican political affiliation predicted perceiving religion-related social benefits post-9/11. Perceptions of social change are important but understudied responses to stressful events.","Poulin, Michael J. and Silver, Roxane Cohen and Gil-Rivas, Virginia and Holman, E.

2292,Ireland says No (again): the 12 June 2008 Referendum on the Lisbon Treaty(1),"This article analyses the significance of the 12 June 2008 Lisbon Treaty referendum in the Republic of Ireland. This was the third such referendum on Europe held in Ireland since the millennium, and the second referendum in three to result in a rejection of an {EU} Treaty following the failed Nice poll in 2001. Assessing both the campaign itself and the reasons for the No vote, the article argues that while variables such as age, educational attainment, geography, gender and social class all have a part to play in explaining the outcome of the referendum, post-referendum analysis suggests that two key phenomena proved decisive. First, an enduring Irish attachment to an overwhelmingly exclusivist national identity rather than more open and fluid identity conceptions means that a space exists where issues such as neutrality, sovereignty and Ireland's relative influence in the {EU} institutional matrix can be readily exploited by opponents of the European integration process, and where any changes in the {EU} constitutional order can be emotively presented as an existential threat to Ireland's values and interests. Second, post-referendum analysis also suggests that lack of knowledge constituted a key reason for voting No. The absence of any effort by government to provide and promote sufficient information channels which explain how and why Ireland's {EU} membership matters means that {EU} 'debates' within Irish political culture are frequently characterised by apathy, confusion, and ignorance, in a context where the chasm in elite-popular opinion has grown wider. The referendum result also points to a growing Eurosceptic tendency in Ireland which has seen the size of the No vote increase from 17\% in 1972 to a decisive majority of 53.4\% in 2008, on a significantly higher turnout than either 2001 or 2002.","O'Brennan, John",0,,2248
2293,"Righteous violence: killing for God, country, freedom and justice","The present article uses terror management theory ({TMT}) to explore the psychological, social and cultural forces that lead diverse groups and individuals to endorse, promote and enact violence against innocent individuals. From this perspective, it is the psychological function of religious, ideological, national or ethnic ties that is crucial for understanding how they can lead to hatred and violence. {TMT} provides an empirically based theoretically driven explanation of how ideological, nationalistic and religious values combine with historical events and concrete grievances to make terrorist violence appealing to those facing individual or group suffering. Research is presented which suggests that many of the same psychological forces that lead terrorists to their violent actions also lead to counter-terrorist policies that create massive collateral damage. This collateral damage appears to further escalate the cycle of violence and may aid the targets of those attacks in recruiting people for the terrorist cause. After examining the issues that inspire such violence, research is presented that suggests possible avenues to decrease support for actions that prolong inter-group conflicts.","Pyszczynski, Tom and Motyl, Matt and Abdollahi, Abdolhossein",0,,2249
2294,A Review of Couple-Based Interventions for Enhancing Women's Sexual Adjustment and Body Image After Cancer,"Despite the growing interest in couple-based interventions for women with cancer, only few of these interventions primarily focus on improving women's sexual and body image. A review of studies that investigated the impact of an intervention on women's sexual adjustment and/or body image was conducted. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria for this review: 8 randomized control trials, 2 pilot randomized control trials, and 2 quasi-experimental designs. Our analysis revealed that interventions that produce stronger effects tend to be couple-focused and include treatment components that (1) educate both partners about the woman's diagnosis and treatments, (2) promote couples' mutual coping and support processes, and (3) include specific sexual therapy techniques to address sexual and body image concerns. Future intervention research should incorporate randomized, controlled clinical trial designs conducted according to the revised {CONSORT} (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials); include measures of body image, sexual satisfaction, and sexual dysfunction; have adequate statistical power; and include more diverse samples, especially women who are younger or from minority or less-educated groups.","Scott, Jennifer L. and Kayser, Karen",0,,2250
2295,The Cycle of Righteous Killing: Psychological Forces in its Prevention and the Promotion of Peace - Home-Grown Terrorism: Understanding and Addressing the Root Causes of Radicalisation Among Groups with an Immigrant Heritage in Europe,"Although many plans for peace in the Middle East have been proposed over the years, none have seriously considered the psychological needs that promote conflict and violence, and thus, far none have been successful. This chapter uses Terror Management Theory, which is a general theory of the role of culture and self-esteem in providing psychological security, to shed light on forces that motivate and perpetuate the ongoing cycle of violence in this region. From this perspective, threats to one's cultural worldviews and self-esteem promote violence because they undermine the ability of these psychological entities to provide the protection from anxiety that is needed for psychological well-being and effective functioning. Consequently, people disparage and lash out at those who threaten their worldviews and self-esteem. Research exploring the role of worldviews and self-esteem in providing security and the impact of threats to this security in promoting violence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the operation of these processes in promoting support for violence against perceived enemies in Israel, Iran, and the United States. This analysis also suggests factors that reduce support for violence; research demonstrating the impact of activating compassionate religious values, a sense of shared humanity, close interpersonal attachments, and removing the association between lofty values and violence is discussed.","Pyszczynski, Tom and Vail, Kenneth E. and Motyl, Matthew S.",0,,2251

College journalism students (N = 101) participated in an experiment where half were primed to think about death and the other half, the control group, thought about dental pain. Then, all of them completed a questionnaire measuring their attitudes toward ethics. Results showed that although those in the death group were no more fearful, they were less relativistic and more strongly opposed to socially undesirable behavior by journalists, such as lying, publishing the names of rape victims, and reporting a public official's sexual affair. Implications for ethics research and journalists are discussed.","Cuillier, David",1,,2252
2297,Preparing Family Caregivers for Death and Bereavement. Insights from Caregivers of Terminally {III} Patients,"Many family caregivers are unprepared for the death of their loved one and may suffer from worse mental health as a result. We therefore sought to determine the factors that family caregivers believe are important to preparing for death and bereavement. Focus groups and ethnographic interviews were conducted with 33 family caregivers (bereaved or current) of terminally ill patients. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Life experiences such as the duration of caregiving/illness, advance care planning, previous experiences with caregiving or death, and medical sophistication all impacted preparedness, or the degree to which a caregiver is ready for the death and bereavement. Regardless of life experiences, however, all caregivers reported medical, practical, psychosocial, and religious/spiritual uncertainty. Because uncertainty was multidimensional, caregivers often needed more than prognostic information in order to prepare. Communication was the primary mechanism used to manage uncertainty. Good communication included clear, reliable information, combined with relationship-centered care from health care providers. Finally, preparedness had cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. To prepare, some caregivers needed information tailored to their uncertainty (cognitive), others needed to ""mentally"" or ""emotionally"" prepare (affective), and still others had important tasks to complete (behavioral). In order to better prepare family caregivers for the death of a loved one, health care providers must develop a trusting relationship with caregivers, provide them with reliable information tailored to their uncertainty, and allow time for caregivers to process the information and complete important tasks.

One hundred fourteen members of the Association of Oncology Social Work completed death anxiety and advance directive communication practices survey instruments. Two research questions served as the foundation for the study: (a) To what extent does death anxiety correlate with the completion of personal advance directives, and (b) To what extent does death anxiety correlate with the communication with patients about advance directives? Sixty-eight percent of the respondents reported having completed a personal advance directive. Results indicated that as death anxiety scores increased, the communication scores decreased related to disclosure of information about advance directives and values in living. The study findings contribute to furthering the understanding of practice challenges that oncology social workers may face as they pursue end- of- life planning with patients.","Peck, Marlys R.",0,,2254

This framework is used to characterize four clusters of individuals, each demonstrating a unique profile of risky behaviors and dispositional characteristics. First, some individuals primarily engage in behaviors that align with the norms of their peers. In contrast, other individuals ensure their behavior concords with their personal attitudes; their behavior is less contingent upon legal policies and enforcement. Third, some motorists deliberately engage in hazardous activities, primarily to foster positive affect. Finally, some individuals do not feel they can override habitual behaviors, such as exceeding speed limits. The dispositional characteristics that coincide with each cluster are also delineated. Furthermore, the leadership structures, marketing campaigns, and mentoring programs that should be directed towards each cluster are discussed.","Moss, Simon A. and Lenne, Michael G. and Wilson, Samuel",0,,2255
2300,Securitization and desecuritization: a dramaturgical analysis of the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority,"Securitization theory has evolved over the past 10-15 years and has fuelled much exciting research, demonstrated through recent contributions by Balzacq, Stritzel, Taurek, and Floyd. Despite a growing number of case studies of successful securitization and desecuritization processes, scholars have retained the statist view of securitization: actors identify an existential threat that requires emergency executive powers, and, if the audience accepts the securitizing move, the issue is depoliticized and is considered a 'security' issue outside the rules of normal politics. This article demonstrates that there are multiple settings of securitizing moves and parses the audience within securitization theory, suggesting a model of at least four distinct types of audiences and speech contexts (popular, elite, technocratic, and scientific). The process of securitization is not a moment of binary decision but rather an iterative, political process between speaker and audience. We must not ask, 'was a securitizing move made' but 'how does a securitizing move mean?' Particularly if one adopts a more interventionist or activist notion of scholarship, a key question for experts must be: how are securitizing moves accepted or rejected? What arc the politics of that successful process of (de)securitization? Using dramaturgical analysis, we suggest that securitizing moves take place within different sociological settings that operate with unique rules, norms, and practices. The example of the Canadian Air Transport Security Association is provided.","Salter, Mark B.",0,,2256

Our assumption was that a set of interdependent 'perceived primal threats' to basic human needs (self-preservation, social integration, personal identity and growth, and positive worldview), which result from the presence of a disease, are related to illness perceptions and subjective health. Participants were 121 chronic medical patients. According to the results, perceived primal threat was strongly associated with illness-related perceptions and problems, as well as perceived psychological and overall self-rated health. Also, perceived primal threat mediated the relationship between illness-related factors and subjective health measures.","Karademas, Evangelos C. and Bakouli, Argyro and Bastounis, Anastasios and Kallergi, Fani and Tamtami, Panagiota and Theofilou, Maria",0,,2257
2302,The Changing Agenda of Military Security,"Securitization is the construction of something as an existential threat to a valued referent object, which is used to support exceptional measures taken in response. Desecuritization occurs when something previously accepted as a threat is no longer constructed as one. The article examine's the changes in the main patterns of securitization in the military sector across four distinct periods: the classical European great power era ending in 1945, the Cold War, the post-Cold War period, and post-September 11 2001. In the post-September 11 period, it is seen that securitization moved away from classical, state-centric framework of securitization and towards one with much more mixed set of actors and referent objects. Though its is too early to assess the durability of this framework of securitization, it is certain that it differs starkly from the previous periods and involves more structures of violence.","Buzan, Barry",0,,2258
2303,Psychological consequences of terrorism,"The paper contains a theoretical survey of negative psychological consequences of terrorism. Psychological consequences are the most effective instrument which enables terrorists to attract attention to themselves and their cause. Another aspect of psychological consequences is the fact that on their basis society forms an attitude to terrorists, which may sometimes be positive. The latter may manifest itself in a conscious desire of an individual or a group to join a terrorist organization or imitate some of its methods to achieve their own goals which may sometimes be criminal or antisocial. Besides, psychological consequences are an information base for committing acts of violence, including terrorist acts, formerly stalled by absence of information about similar acts. Thus, inquiry into psychological consequences of terrorism, factors affecting attitudes to the phenomenon in people's minds has not only theoretical, but practical value as well.","Enikolopov, S.

2304,Inscriptions of violence: Societal and medical neglect of child abuse - impact on life and health,"Objective A sickness history from General Practice will be unfolded with regard to its implicit lived meanings. This experiential matrix will be analyzed with regard to its medico-theoretical aspects. Method The analysis is grounded in a phenomenology of the body. The patient Katherine Kaplan lends a particular portrait to the dynamics that are enacted in the interface between socially silenced domestic violence and the theoretical assumptions of human health as these inform the clinical practice of health care. Results By applying an understanding of sickness that transcends the mind-body split, a concealed and complex logic emerges. This logic is embedded in a nexus of the impact of childhood abuse experience and the medical disinterest in subjective experiences and their impact on selfhood and health. Its core is twofold: the violation of embodiment resulting from intra-familial abuse and existential threat, and the embodiment of violation resulting from social rules and the theoretically blinded medical gaze. Conclusion A considerable medical investment, apparently conducted in a correct and consistent manner as to diagnostic and therapeutic measures, results in the complete incapacitation of a young physician.","Kirkengen, Anna Luise",0,,2260
2305,Black September: The 1970-71 Events and their Impact on the Formation of Jordanian National Identity,"Soon after the 1967 War, the Palestinian Resistance Movements ({PRM}) which established themselves in Jordan challenged Jordan's authority presenting a military and even existential threat to Hashemite rule. The prestige of the fedayeen as the primary torchbearers of the struggle against Israel rose dramatically following the Karameh Operation of March 1968, which was perceived as a military victory by the {PRM} and entrenched its legitimacy. The period between the Karameh raid and September 1970 was characterized by the strengthening of the fedayeen organizations and their entrenchment in Jordan by means of the establishment of autonomous military, political, and social institutions. The bloody events of September 1970-July 1971 induced a change in Jordan's official ideological line and marked a significant step in the coalescence of Jordanian national identity. From then on, the particularist trans-Jordanian identity in Jordan was emphasized more explicitly, along with such other attributes of this identity as Bedouin tribal identity, Islamic identity, and Hashemite identity.","Fruchter-Ronen, Iris",0,,2261

2307,Psychological needs and values underlying left-right political orientation: Cross-national evidence from Eastern and Western Europe,"According to previous research conducted mainly in the United States, psychological needs pertaining to the management of uncertainty and threat predict right-wing conservatism, operationally defined in terms of resistance to change and acceptance of inequality. In this study, we analyze data from 19 countries included in the European Social Survey ({ESS}) to assess two sets of hypotheses: (1) that traditionalism (an aspect of resistance to change) and acceptance of inequality would be positively associated with right (versus left) orientation, and (2) that rule-following (an aspect of the need for order), high need for security, and low need for openness to experience would be associated with right (versus left) orientation, adjusting for quadratic effects associated with ideological extremity. In addition, we determine the extent to which the pattern of relations among needs, values, and political orientation was similar in Eastern and Western European contexts. Results from regression and structural equation models indicate that traditionalism and, to a lesser extent, rule-following predict right-wing conservatism in both regions, whereas acceptance of inequality predicts right-wing orientation in the West only. Although openness to experience was associated with preferences for greater equality in both regions, it was associated with left-wing orientation in Western Europe and right-wing orientation in Eastern Europe. Needs for security, conversely, were associated with right-wing orientation in Western Europe and left-wing orientation in Eastern Europe. Thus, we find evidence of both universal and context-specific effects in our analysis of the cognitive and motivational antecedents of left-right political orientation.","Thorisdottir, Hulda and Jost, John T. and Liviatan, Ido and Shrout, Patrick E.",0,,2263

By using survey data from a representative sample of the U.S. adult population, the influence of mortality salience on two consumption behaviors-brand name consumption and compulsive consumption-was examined. The results showed that people with a greater fear of becoming a terrorism victim showed a greater tendency for brand name consumption and compulsive consumption. Further, the relationship between mortality salience and materialistic consumption depended on the extent to which possession of materials becomes a source of one' self-esteem. Implications for academic researchers, advertisers, and consumer educators are discussed.","Choi, Jounghwa and Kwon, Kyoung-Nan and Lee, Mira",0,,2264
2309,Psychosocial analysis of the collective processes in the United States after September 11,"This article studies alterations in the values, attitudes, and behaviors that emerged among U.S. citizens as a consequence of, and as a response to, the attacks of September 11, 2001. The study briefly examines the immediate reaction to the attack, before focusing on the collective reactions that characterized the behavior of the majority of the population between the events of 9111 and the response to it in the form of intervention in Afghanistan. In studying this period an eight-phase sequential model (Botcharova, 2001) is used, where the initial phases center oil the nation as the ingroup and the latter focus on the enemy who carried out the attack as the outgroup. The study is conducted from a psychosocial perspective and uses ""social identity theory"" (Taifel \& Turner; 1979, 1986) as the basic framework for interpreting and accounting for the collective reactions recorded. The main purpose of this paper is to show that the interpretation of these collective reactions is consistent with the postulates of social identity theory. The application of this theory provides a different and specific analysis of events. The study is based oil data obtained from a variety of rigorous academic studies and opinion polls conducted in relation to the events of 9/11. In line with social identity theory, 9111 had a marked impact on the importance attached by the majority of U.S. citizens to their identity as members of a nation. This in turn accentuated group differentiation and activated ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination (Taffel \& Turner, 1979, 1986). Ingroup favoritism strengthened group cohesion, feelings of solidarity, and identification with the most emblematic values of the U.S. nation, while outgroup discrimination induced U.S. citizens to conceive the enemy (al-Qaeda and its protectors) as the incarnation of evil, depersonalizing the group and venting their anger on it, and to give their backing to a military response, the eventual intervention in Afghanistan. Finally, and also ill line with the postulates of social identity theory, as an alternative to the virtual bipolarization of the conflict (U.S. vs al-Qaeda), the activation of a higher level of identity in the ingroup is proposed, a group that includes the United States and the largest possible number of countries-including Islamic states-in the search for a common, more legitimate and effective solution.","Rodriguez-Carballeira, A. and Javaloy, F.",0,,2265
2310,Fear of death,"Shortly before his death in 1995, Kenneth B. Schwartz, a cancer patient at Massachusetts General Hospital ({MGH}) founded The Kenneth B. Schwartz Center at {MGH}. The Schwartz Center((R)) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery, which provides hope to the patient and support to caregivers and encourages the healing process. The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds', a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. For many, cancer is synonymous with death. Fearing death is a rational response. For too long, medicine has ignored this primeval fear. Increasingly, clinicians recognize and address end-of-life issues, facing patients' and our own emotional vulnerabilities in order to connect and explore problems and fears. Listening and learning from the patient guides us as we acknowledge much of the mystery that still surrounds the dying process. Rarely is there a simple or right answer. An empathetic response to suffering patients is the best support. Support is vital in fostering the adjustment of patients. A silent presence may prove more helpful than well-meant counsel for many patients. Through an examination of eight caregiver narratives of their patients' experiences, the role of the health care provider in the dying process, particularly in regard to challenging fear, is reviewed.","Penson, R.

2311,The motivational underpinnings of religion,Terror management theory and research can rectify shortcornings in Atran \& Norenzayan's (A\&N's) analysis of religion. (1) Religious and secular worldviews are much more similar than the target article supposes; (2) a propensity for embracing supernatural beliefs is likely to have conferred an adaptive advantage over the course of evolution; and (3) the claim that supernatural agent beliefs serve a terror management function independent of worldview bolstering is not empirically supported.,"L and au, M.

2312,Religious thought and behaviour as by-products of brain function,"Religious concepts activate various functionally distinct mental systems, present also in non-religious contexts, and 'tweak' the usual inferences of these systems. They deal with detection and representation of animacy and agency, social exchange, moral intuitions, precaution against natural hazards and understanding of misfortune. Each of these activates distinct neural resources or families of networks. What makes notions of supernatural agency intuitively plausible? This article reviews evidence suggesting that it is the joint, coordinated activation of these diverse systems, a supposition that opens up the prospect of a cognitive neuroscience of religious beliefs.","Boyer, P.",0,,2268
2313,Complexity management theory: Motivation for ideological rigidity and social conflict,"We are doomed to formulate conceptual structures that are much simpler than the complex phenomena they are attempting to account for. These simple conceptual structures shield us, pragmatically, from real-world complexity, but also fail, frequently, as some aspect of what we did not take into consideration makes itself manifest. The failure of our concepts dysregulates our emotions and generates anxiety, necessarily, as the unconstrained world is challenging and dangerous. Such dysregulation can turn us into rigid, totalitarian dogmatists, as we strive to maintain the structure of our no longer valid beliefs. Alternatively, we can face the underlying complexity of experience, voluntarily, gather new information, and recast and reconfigure the structures that underly our habitable worlds.","Peterson, J.

2314,Existential support in brain tumour patients and their spouses,"Caring for patients with brain tumours raises existential questions. The aims of this study were to describe the opinions of nurses, patients and next-of-kin on existential support and how this is prioritised. Patients and method: a total of 20 brain tumour patients, 16 family members and 16 nurses underwent explorative, tape-recorded, semistructured interviews about existential issues. Results: the nurses' opinions about the importance and prioritisation of existential support could be divided into four main groups: 1) religion, 2) ""a diffuse picture"", 3) conversation, and 4) questions of vital importance. They generally had a favourable attitude towards existential issues but thought those issues were difficult to deal with in practice due to lack of time, lack of knowledge and fear. Without exception, patients and family members were satisfied with the medical and physical treatment, but not with the existential support. They had, to a great extent, wished for existential support, and especially for the opportunity of talking about the existential threat that had arisen. Obstacles to this were thought to be due to the staff being under much stress, being afraid and unskilled. The importance of closeness and presence, which decreased existential isolation, was emphasised.","Strang, S. and Strang, P. and Ternestedt, B. M.",0,,2270
2315,"The intra-national struggle to define ""us"": External involvement as a two-way street","Three perspectives on the causes of communal conflict are visible in extant work: a focus on ancient hatreds, on leaders, or on the context that leaders ""find"" themselves in. Leaders therefore have all the power to mobilize people to fight (or not to) or leaders are driven by circumstantial opportunities or the primordial desires of the masses to resist peace or coexistence with historical enemies. Analysts who focus on leaders or context recognize that external actors affect internal conflicts, but little systematic research has explored the processes relating the domestic politics of nationalist mobilization to factors in the international arena. How does the international arena affect the competition among leaders? How do skillful leaders draw in external actors to lend credibility to their own views? This article asserts that leaders compete to frame identity and mission, and explores the degree to which international factors affect whose ""definitions of the situation"" are successful in precipitating mobilization shifts among potential followers. A unique finding of this longitudinal study of Northern Ireland is that the role played by international institutions and actors is affected by how domestic actors perceive, cultivate, and bring attention to the linkages between the two spheres.","Grove, A.",0,,2271
2316,Speech acts: Sampling the social construction of mental retardation in everyday life,"A sample of speech acts in everyday discourse referring to persons or events having to do with the term mental retardation was analyzed in order to investigate the belief that language use both constructs and reflects cultural norms that define the social roles of persons reduced to object status through categorical membership. Speech acts gathered suggest four emergent themes: the discourse of category membership, the dichotomy of normal and abnormal, issues of place and space, and fear. These themes were explicated from a social constructionist perspective, displaying the way speech acts construct mental retardation and subvert individuals with the label into demeaned and ridiculed objects of cultural fear.","Danforth, S. and Navarro, V.",0,,2272
