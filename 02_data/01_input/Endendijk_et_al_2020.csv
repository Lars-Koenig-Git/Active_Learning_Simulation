1,"Alarcão, V., et al. (2015",Exploring gender in Portuguese bedrooms: Men’s and women’s narratives of their sexuality through a mixed methods approach.,"The nature of intimacy and self-identity changed profoundly over the past century. The disruption between sex and procreation enabled the emergence of new forms of relationships and contributed towards the legitimacy of a sexuality focused on pleasure, as a mean of self-realization and an expression of intimacy. Despite the evidence that most individuals now approach close relations with expectations of mutual emotional support and romantic love, intimate relationships remain highly gendered, particularly in societies where traditional roles of men and women persist in the growing diversity of sexual relationships. To address this topic, an empirical research was conducted in the Greater Lisbon area using a mixed methods approach. First, a quantitative study, with 323 primary healthcare users, intended to explain how gender influences self-constructions of sexuality and intimacy. Then, a qualitative study, with a subsample of 10 heterosexual men and 15 heterosexual women, employed in-depth interviews to explore how individuals construct their etiquette of sexual behavior. Building upon Gagnon and Simon's scripting theory and Giddens' transformations of intimacy, along with feminist criticisms concerning male dominance in hetero-relationships, we have reached an explanatory typology that focuses on Portuguese specificity in terms of the subjective experience of sexuality and intimate relationships. Sexuality and intimacy are complex and multifaceted phenomena that are affected by sexual and non-sexual factors, both in and out of the bedroom. Key findings reveal a coexistence of highly gendered sexual scripts with increasingly more egalitarian sexual roles, namely among the youngest and the most educated generations in Portuguese society.

2,"Alexander, M. G. and T. D. Fisher (2003",Truth and consequences: Using the bogus pipeline to examine sex differences in self-reported sexuality.,"Men report more permissive sexual attitudes and behavior than do women. This experiment tested whether these differences might result from false accommodation to gender norms (distorted reporting consistent with gender stereotypes). Participants completed questionnaires under three conditions. Sex differences in self-reported sexual behavior were negligible in a bogus pipeline condition in which participants believed lying could be detected, moderate in an anonymous condition, and greatest in an exposure threat condition in which the experimenter could potentially view participants' responses. This pattern was clearest for behaviors considered less acceptable for women than men (e.g., masturbation, exposure to hardcore and softcore erotica). Results suggest that some sex differences in self-reported sexual behavior reflect responses influenced by normative expectations for men and women.

3,"Ali-Faisal, S. F. (2014",Crossing sexual barriers: The influence of background factors and personal attitudes on sexual guilt and sexual anxiety among Canadian and American Muslim women and men.,"Sexual health is a key component of health and well-being, yet, to date, very little research has been done exploring the sexual health of non-majority individuals. This study addresses this lack by exploring the impact of background and attitudinal factors on the sexual guilt and sexual anxiety of young Muslim men and women in North America. Sexual guilt and anxiety have been found to have negative consequences on the sexual lives of individuals and to be related to conservative attitudes regarding sexuality. As Muslims' attitudes regarding sex and sexuality are often conservative, at times even restrictive, sexual guilt and sexual anxiety may be a problem faced by many Muslims in North America. Yet the religious restrictions on unsanctioned sexual activities may be enforced by sexual guilt and anxiety. Using path analysis, the current study investigated the religiosity, sexual attitudes, perceived parental sexual attitudes, belief in the sexual double standard, gender role attitudes, gender, and sexual experience and their relationship to sexual guilt and anxiety. Questionnaires were administered online and 403 young Muslim adults from across Canada and the United States participated. Two path models were tested proposing that religiosity, perceived parental sexual attitudes, and gender would predict sexual guilt and anxiety indirectly through the mediation of sexual attitudes, belief in the sexual double standard, and gender role attitudes. These models did not fit the data and were therefore re-specified and tested. The final, best fitting models found religiosity to both directly and indirectly influence sexual guilt and anxiety while sexual attitudes, belief in the sexual double standard, and gender role attitudes partially mediated this relationship. Gender role attitudes strongly determined participants' support for the sexual double standard, while gender was not a predictor of sexual guilt or anxiety. Perceived parental attitudes had no predictive value, possibly being redundant with religiosity. Finally, sexual experience directly and indirectly influenced sexual guilt and anxiety with sexual attitudes partially meditating this relationship. The path models revealed complex and interesting relationships between the variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,3
4,"Allison, R. and B. J. Risman (2013",A double standard for ,"While sexual attitudes have liberalized in the past half century, research is mixed as to whether attitudes have become less gendered over time. Recent studies on college students' sexual and romantic relationships suggest that a sexual double standard continues to organize sexuality on many campuses. Data from the Online College Social Life Survey shed light on students' evaluation of casual sex, or ""hooking up."" In addition to exploring gendered attitudinal patterns, we use gender structure theory to explore how individual characteristics and normative expectations of campus group affiliations shape attitudes. While three quarters of students do not hold different standards for men and women's hooking up, attitudes are more conservative than liberal, with almost half of students losing respect for men and women who hook up ""a lot."" However, men are more likely to hold a traditional double standard, while women are more likely to espouse egalitarian conservative attitudes. Individual characteristics, including age, religion, race, social class and sexual orientation are frequently related to sexual attitudes, as are number of hook ups, fraternity/sorority affiliation and varsity athletic participation.

5,"Alves, M. P., et al. (2008",Gender and social representations: Dual sexual pattern as a function of religion and political opinion.,"The non-experimental study presented sought to identify and characterize pre-matrimonial sexual standards at an individual and social level and analyze these norms as a function of sex, religion and political opinion in a sample of 308 graduate students. The results point to the adherence to the double standard at an individual level in a tenuous form, gathering more consensus in its social form, i.e. in the perception of moral duplicity within the judgments and evaluations of sexual behavior by society in general. The analysis of the influence of religion and political opinion on social representations of pre-matrimonial sexuality highlighted the fact that, despite religious factors and conservative political opinions are negatively associated to experience and permissiveness of sexual attitudes, there is a common tendency within religious and political groups towards the adherence to the sexual double-standard both at an individual and social form. The implications of results are discussed within the framework of social representations theory and gender. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",1,5
6,"Anderson, C. (2012",An examination of the effects of the sexual double standard on college students' condom use.,"Men and women have historically been held to different standards regarding sexual behavior, known as the sexual double standard. Women have typically been judged more harshly than men for engaging in similar sexual behavior. Both genders report higher levels of sexual activity and more liberal attitudes since the 1940s. Males historically report engaging in more sexual activity than females. However, current studies indicate both genders are engaging in similar levels of sexual activity, although men continue to report slightly higher levels. It is unclear whether attitudes and judgments related to gender and sexuality have kept pace with reported behavior changes. The documented increase in sexual activity for men and women has coincided with a dramatic increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Consistent condom use during all forms of sexual activity has been recommended as the most reliable method of pregnancy and STD prevention. However, many individuals report inconsistent condom use. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the potential role the sexual double standard may play in the inconsistent use of condoms in college women. Undergraduate students were asked to read one of three vignettes (male provides condom, female provides condom, no condom was used) in which a casual sexual encounter was described. After reading the vignette, participants completed adjective ratings of the vignette actors, as well as measures of attitudes toward gender and sexuality, sexual history, and demographics. Contrary to expectations, results indicated that females were judged to be more likeable when she provided the condom compared to when no condom was used and more diplomatic when she provided the condom when compared to when no condom was used or when the male provided the condom. Males were equally liked across all condom conditions, and were rated as more diplomatic when providing the condom versus when no condom was used. Unexpectedly, neither judgments of the vignette actors nor attitudes toward gender and sexuality were predictive of personal sexual history. These findings suggest that gender differences in sexual behavior may be quite small, and that standards for sexual behavior are more equal than has been previously documented.

7,"Andres, D., et al. (1983",Selected psychosocial characteristics of males: Their relationship to contraceptive use and abortion.,"111 men whose partners were either receiving an early 1st-trimester abortion or obtaining contraception were compared on personality characteristics, attitudes toward sex-related topics, and variables describing their relationship with their partners. Questionnaires administered included the Traditional Sex-Determined Role Standards Scale, Attitude toward Sex in General Scale, Premarital Contraceptive Attitude Instrument, the Attitude toward Abortion Scale, and the Differential Personality Inventory. As predicted, the major differences between these groups were in the areas of attitudes and sexual relationship with partner. Ss in the contraceptive group expressed more liberal attitudes toward sex and contraceptive practices as well as a higher frequency of coitus than Ss in the abortion partner group. Data were further analyzed by dividing the abortion partner group into those who had used contraception in the past and those who had not. The finding that more conservative attitudes toward sex-related topics were held by the noncontracepting Ss, particularly those involved with an abortion, supports D. Byrne's (1983) theoretical formulations concerning the importance of attitudes in determining contraceptive behavior. (35 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,7
8,"Anisimowicz, Y. and L. F. O’Sullivan (2017",Men’s and Women’s Use and Creation of Online Sexually Explicit Materials Including Fandom-Related Works.,"The Internet and mobile computing have been highly influential in shaping the modern technological era and subsequently the production of and access to online sexually explicit materials (SEM). Fandomâthe realm of fans sharing a common interestâhas also adapted to the Internet, which has changed how fans access and distribute fanworks (i.e., material created by fans such as stories and art), many of which contain SEM. The current study examined gender differences in the use and creation of online SEM by surveying 468 men and 347 women (ages 18 or older; mean ageÂ =Â 33.8Â years) residing in North America. Participants completed anonymous measures assessing demographic information, experiences using and creating online SEM, and measures of related sexual attitudes. Use of online SEM was widely reported by participants, with men (87.8Â %) indicating more use than with women (67.4Â %). As expected, few participants reported creating online SEM (3.6Â % of men, 4.9Â % of women). Men and women reported similar levels of preferred sexual explicitness in the online SEM that they used. There were no significant gender differences in the use of fanworks reported by men (14.3Â %) and women (14.7Â %) or in the creation of fanworks (1.5Â % of men, 3.2Â % of women). Fandom-related online SEM use was predicted only by more permissive sexual attitudes (one of eight predictors). Although there were many similarities between menâs and womenâs use of online SEM, some gender differences were found in their motives for online SEM use. Findings are discussed in terms of the context in which men and women experience online SEM. Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",1,8
9,"Ankomah, A. (1998",Condom use in sexual exchange relationships among young single adults in Ghana.,"This article discusses some personal and situational factors which hinder the use of condoms among young single adults ages 18 to 25 years engaged in sexual exchange relationships in a Ghanaian town. Based on focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, this article highlights some key impediments often not adequately discussed in the discourse on condom use but considered vital in any attempt to increase condom use and ultimately reduce HIV transmission. This includes the dilemma facing women who want to use condoms for HIV prevention in premarital sexual exchange relationships (quite different from prostitution) contracted with material gain in mind. Women may face the risk of losing material benefits from sexual exchange relationships if the man is unwilling to use condoms. It is recommended that HIV health educators must increase the involvement of young single adults in exploring these and situational impediments and together design interventions to improve condom use. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews conducted in Cape Coast, Ghana, revealed significant obstacles to condom use among single women 18-25 years of age. Most female respondents were self-employed small-scale traders with low incomes, while male participants tended to be clerks or fishermen. In this society, men are considered the source of economic and physical power and in a position to demand sexual favors. Material recompense (e.g., money, food, or clothing) for premarital sex is standard practice outside the commercial sex work establishment and women often switch rapidly from relationship to relationship in search of a more materially rewarding arrangement. Such behavior is condoned--often encouraged--by young women's mothers. Condom use is rare and associated with infidelity. Thus, Ghanaian women face the dilemma of choosing between economic survival and unsafe sex. Since men perceive condoms as reducing sexual sensitivity, they are unlikely to remain with a partner who insists on condom use. Moreover, sexual relationships are embedded in an atmosphere of fear of violence. If women are to insist on condom use, they must believe the risk of HIV infection is not adequately compensated by the material gains received from the sexual encounter. It is recommended that community-level HIV preventive interventions target men with messages about the importance of trying condom use. Ultimately, however, reconstruction of gender-based power relationships and improvements in women's economic status are essential to reduce women's dependence on sexual networking.",1,9
10,"Antonovsky, H. F., et al. (1980",Gender differences in patterns of adolescent sexual behavior.,"Findings of a questionnaire survey of sexual attitudes and behavior of a large nationwide sample of Israeli adolescents (N = 410) show clear gender differences in patterns of sexual behavior even among kibbutz adolescents who express very permissive attitudes toward premarital coitus and live under conditions that provide easy access to potential sexual partners. Permissive conditions increase rates of coitus among female adolescents, but this sexual experience occurs within the framework of an emotionally involving relationship. Kibbutz girls who report coital rates equal to those of kibbutz and nonkibbutz boys (about 40%) have their first coital relationship with a steady boyfriend with whom they are in love and continue having sexual relations with the same partner. This pattern is similar to that of nonkibbutz females, who report much lower rates of coitus (14%). Males do not necessarily have sexual relations in the context of an emotional relationship. Findings are interpreted in terms of patterns of sex-role socialization. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,10

Korotayev (2003",Monopolization of information and female status: A cross-cultural test.,"The world-wide cross-cultural tests performed in this paper support the hypothesis that monopolization of politically important information is inversely related with female status. Monopolization of politically important information displays a significant negative correlation with such important characteristics of female status as female leadership posts in kinship or extended family units, female ownership or control of dwellings, high value of female life, absence of a double standard in regard to extramarital sex, absence of physical punishment of wives, and absence of belief that women are generally inferior to men.

12,"Askun, D. and B. Ataca (2007",Sexuality related attitudes and behaviors of Turkish university students.,"In this study, sexual attitudes and behaviors of Turkish university students were explored by taking many influential agents both at the distal and the proximal levels into consideration. A total of 563 students from three universities located in three cities completed a questionnaire that assessed their virginity status, first intercourse, sexual permissiveness, pornography usage, endorsement of traditional sexual double standards, and the perception of parental attitudes about sexuality. The results showed that women and students from rural areas were more traditional and conservative in their attitudes and behaviors regarding sexuality. The perception of maternal restriction about sexuality was related to sexual conservatism, negative affective reaction at first coitus, and endorsing traditional sexual double standards. The results are discussed in terms of various degrees of influences originating from proximal and distal variables in the Turkish context.

The sample consisted of prime-time television dramas that featured characters between the ages of 12 and 22 years. Two major goals guided the study. First, the types of sexual consequences in teen programming were investigated. Results showed that emotional and social consequences far outnumbered physical consequences. Second, the portrayal of the sexual double standard was investigated. Negative consequences were more common in scenes in which female characters initiated sexual activities than in scenes in which male characters initiated sexual activities.

We argue there are strong theoretical reasons to expect that the magnitude of this double standard varies across substantive domains, as well as among parents and non-parents. We also argue key methodological limitations of previous studies likely produce an under-estimate of the gender double standard. We provide empirical estimates of the gender double standard that overcome these limitations, including a random-assignment experiment explicitly designed to control the effects of social desirability. These estimates demonstrate variability in the double standard across domains and reveal key factors contributing to the magnitude of the double standards in parenting attitudes held by individuals.

15,"Bailey, W. C., et al. (1987","Relation of sex and gender role to love, sexual attitudes, and self-esteem.","One theory of love (J. A. Lee, The Colors of Love: An Exploration of the Ways of Loving, Don Mills, Ontario: New Press, 1973) assumes at least six different attitudinal orientations toward love. Based on Lee's approach, recent research (e.g., C. Hendrick & S. Hendrick, ""A Theory and Method of Love,"" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1986, 50, pp. 392-402) has found consistent sex differences in love attitudes. Other research has found comparable sex differences in sexual permissiveness and other sexual attitudes. The present study explored the possibility that gender role orientation might be related to differences in love and sexual attitudes. A sample of 286 college students completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), Love Attitudes Scale, Sexual Attitudes Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Correlational analyses revealed many significant associations among love and sexual attitudes, self-esteem, and masculinity and femininity. Subjects were also classified according to gender role as androgynous, masculine, feminine, or undifferentiated, according to BSRI scores. Analyses of variance showed effects for both sex of subjects and gender role orientation on several of the dependent measures. The pattern of the results suggested that sex-stereotyped couples may have difficulties in romantic relationships because of the discrepancies in their love and sexual attitudes. An argument was made in support of the recent trend toward a multidimensional concept of gender role orientation. Â© 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",1,15
16,"Bajos, N., et al. (2013",Normative tensions and women's contraceptive attitudes and practices in four African countries.,"Conventional analyses of the obstacles to contraceptive use in Africa focus on the social value attributed to high fertility, the fear of side effects and problems of accessing contraception. This article studies the range of situations that can lead to unplanned pregnancy and aims to identify the social rationales that foster such situations. Two hundred semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2006-2007 in the capitals of Burkina Faso, Ghana, Morocco and Senegal as part of the survey on Emergency Contraception in Africa (ECAF). The analyses reveal that simultaneously trying to observe reproductive and sexual norms - in which a double standard prohibits premarital sex for young women while endorsing the primacy of male sexual pleasure - leads to unprotected or poorly protected intercourse. While the factors are relatively similar in the four countries, the rigidity of the norms in question differs from one to another, notably with regard to premarital sexuality. Finally, the question of effective contraceptive use goes far beyond the issue of Â«unmet needsÂ», a central concept in the literature which focuses on non-use of contraception. Â© I.N.E.D.

17,"Balanko, S. L. (2003",Emancipatory sexuality education: An exploration of young women's perceptions of their sexuality and sexuality education influences.,"This research aimed to: provide young women with emancipatory feminist sex education, explore quantitatively and qualitatively young women's perceptions of their sexuality and sex education influences, and expand our understanding of female sexuality. These purposes were achieved through the administration of a 6-week sexuality education curriculum to two groups of university women (ages 19-24) within a delayed-treatment experimental design with short-term follow-up. The Our Whole Lives (OWL): Sexuality Education Curriculum for Grades 10-12 (Goldfarb & Casparian, 2000) and Adults (Kimball, 2000) were used in this research. Guided by Feminist Standpoint Theory (Hartsock, 1998) and naturalistic inquiry (Guba & Lincoln, 1982), quantitative survey methods and qualitative interviews and observational field notes were the data collection methods. It was hypothesized that at posttest and follow-up participants would exhibit more sexual assertiveness, less acceptance of rape/coercion myths, less acceptance of the sexual double standard, and greater acknowledgment of their sexual desire than at pretest. It was also hypothesized that, at posttest, participants who received sexuality education would differ significantly from those waiting for the education on measures of: sexual assertiveness, endorsement of sexual coercion/rape myths, acceptance of the sexual double standard, and sexual desire. There were several statistically significant results, and the quantitative and qualitative findings converged. First, participants became less interested in being sexual with a partner, but more interested in being sexual with themselves. The consciousness-raising objectives were achieved, and participants became more open to masturbation, sexual diversity, and sexuality and spirituality. Participants emerged more self-reflective, self-aware, and self-accepting. As participants were self-reflective and self-disclosing during the program, they also began to re-evaluate their sexuality and sometimes re-defined themselves. Generally, participants became more self-focused as a result of their participation. Finally, contrary to expectation, participants' attitudes toward the sexual double standard were unchanged, and they were not any less concerned with body image issues and reputation concerns. Apparently, young women can experience positive outcomes from short-term sexuality education. Now it is time to advocate for widespread implementation and evaluation of emancipatory sexuality education with a range of contexts and participants.

18,"Bareket, O., et al. (2018",The madonna-whore dichotomy: Men who perceive women's nurturance and sexuality as mutually exclusive endorse patriarchy and show lower relationship satisfaction.,"The Madonna-Whore Dichotomy (MWD) denotes polarized perceptions of women in general as either ""good,"" chaste, and pure Madonnas or as ""bad,"" promiscuous, and seductive whores. Whereas prior theories focused on unresolved sexual complexes or evolved psychological tendencies, feminist theory suggests the MWD stems from a desire to reinforce patriarchy. Surveying 108 heterosexual Israeli men revealed a positive association between MWD endorsement and patriarchy-enhancing ideology as assessed by Social Dominance Orientation (preference for hierarchical social structures), Gender-Specific System Justification (desire to maintain the existing gender system), and sexist attitudes (Benevolent and Hostile Sexism, Sexual Objectification of Women, and Sexual Double Standards). In addition, MWD endorsement negatively predicted men's romantic relationship satisfaction. These findings support the feminist notion that patriarchal arrangements have negative implications for the well-being of men as well as women. Specifically, the MWD not only links to attitudes that restrict women's autonomy, but also impairs men's most intimate relationships with women. Increased awareness of motives underlying the MWD and its psychological costs can help practice professionals (e.g., couple therapists), as well as the general public, to foster more satisfying heterosexual relationships.

19,"Barron, S. R. (2011","Perceptions of sexual coercion: Understanding the role of gender, intimacy, and alcohol use.","Sexual coercion is a prevalent problem in college dating relationships. While considerable research has examined variables related to sexual coercion, few studies have explicitly examined college students' perceptions of these variables or the way in which variables interact to influence perceptions. In addition, while the notion of a sexual coercion 'double standard' is not new, it has only recently received attention in sexual coercion research within college samples. This study further examined college students' perceptions of sexually coercive dating situations by differentiating the ways in which several variables of interest interact and influence participants' judgment regarding coerciveness. Variables examined included sexual precedence (established vs. absent), alcohol intoxication (victim vs. perpetrator), and gender of the victim (male vs. female). These variables were selected based on both their demonstrated importance in previous research regarding sexual coercion, as well as the paucity of research specifically examining the gender of the victim and its relationship to the other variables of interest. In addition, this study explored differences between male and female participants' perceptions of coercion. Results from 310 participants revealed significant two and three-way interactions. General findings suggest that under certain conditions men and women have similar perceptions of coerciveness. This finding is believed to be important as it is contrary to prior research indicating women tend to perceive situations more coercively than men (Banka, Caraway, Struckman-Johnson & Granaas, 2007). Interactions also revealed that female participants rated the level of coerciveness similarly regardless of whether the victim was male or female. Alternately, male participants rated vignettes significantly lower in coerciveness when the victim was portrayed to be a male. This study also found that when the perpetrator was portrayed as intoxicated, participants did not differ in perceptions of coerciveness regardless of whether the victim was male or female. However, when the victim was portrayed as intoxicated, participants found the vignettes significantly more coercive when a female was portrayed as the victim. These findings are believed to provide indirect evidence of a double standard in sexual coercion and suggest that, compared to women, men may adhere more strongly to traditional beliefs regarding sexual violence.

Consistent with Zucker (2004), the authors argue that a distinctive characteristic of egalitarians is that their acceptance of feminist values with regard to their own sexual lives does not translate into a critique of gendered sexual norms for other women.

Comparisons are made between ""preppies"" and college-bound public school students in terms of sexual attitudes and behavior as well as with the earlier studies of Kinsey, Pomeroy et al., Sorensen, and Haas. The results indicate that, even when measured by the standards of the schools themselves, preppies rank lower in many areas, especially attitudinal, than their public school counterparts. Despite the enormous amount of faculty energy expended to prevent it, the sexual activity of the prep school student, both in amount and degree of sophistication, is significantly greater than is found in public school students. Further, in terms of sex-related drug use, exploitiveness, female self-image, homophobia and sexism, preppies do not compare favorably with public school students. Hypotheses are advanced to account for the differences detected and suggestions made for future research. It is also suggested that the research technique used in this study has great potential for future study of adolescent sexual attitudes and behavior that, in the past, have been extremely difficult to perform. This study reports the results of a questionnaire and interview-based study designed to test the often-stated claims of US college preparatory schools, (prep schools) that, along with a high-quality education, they also instill a superior system of values than is possible in a public school.

Further, in terms of sex-related drug use, exploitiveness, female self-image, homophobia and sexism, preppies do not compare favorably with public school students. It is possible that the significantly higher degree of homophobia shown by preppie males is related to the strong homosexual overtones that may be associated with all-male prep schools and dormitories. If the preppie males were significantly less supportive of equal rights for all regardless of gender, they may perceive females to be unworthy of equal rights and perhaps categorize them as belonging to a group available for exploitation, be it sexual, economic or otherwise. Consistent with the feminist hypothesis is that prep school graduates were significantly less supportive of ""feminism and equal rights for all regardless of gender"" than were public school graduates, and that preppies reported higher family income than that of public school graduates.",1,22

They had also had more partners for intercourse and more lifetime intercourse experience. Age of first intercourse remained unchanged, however. Altitudes for both sexes became more permissive and males also perceived their parents to have become more permissive. A continuing double-standard was suggested. There were increases in contraceptive frequency, in contraception at last intercourse, and use of more sophisticated contraceptive methods.

24,"Bliss, B. A. (2014",Is it still a sexual offense if society doesn't find it offensive? cultural constructions and rape proclivity.,"Because rape statistics on college campuses remain shockingly high, prevention of rape is crucially important. However, in order to prevent rape, individuals must first understand the factors that influence a person's likelihood to rape (i.e. a person's rape proclivity). Cultural constructions of rape, sexuality, and gender roles contribute to the continued prevalence of rape in our society. The current study utilized a sample of 153 undergraduate students to examine the relationships between belief in the sexual double standard, rape myth acceptance, and rape proclivity. Primary results indicated that belief in the sexual double standard is positively correlated with male rape proclivity but negatively correlated with female rape proclivity. Rape myth acceptance is positively correlated with the likelihood to rape in both men and women. Men are more likely to believe in the sexual double standard, accept rape myths, and endorse the likelihood to rape. These results suggest that rape prevention strategies should employ education to decrease a person's belief in the sexual double standard and rape myths.

Sexually active, late adolescent college students (N = 154, 62.3% female; mean age 20.8 years, 76% European American) participated in the study. Predictors from the original HBM included perceived vulnerability, condom use self-efficacy, and attitudes about condoms. In addition, peer norms for condom use and sexual behavior, general sexual attitudes, and endorsement of the sexual double standard were included as predictors of safer sex behavior. Attitudes about condoms, perceived vulnerability, condom use self-efficacy, and the sexual double standard emerged as significant correlates of condom use. General sexual attitudes and the sexual double standard were significantly correlated with alcohol use before or during sex. With the addition of these variables, the regression models accounted for 28% of the variance in condom use, and 14% of the variance in alcohol use before or during sex.

The focus of this study included messages about sexuality, sexual beliefs, sexual experiences with a view to consent and resistance, religiosity, and certain interrelations therein. A total of 471 students (273 women, M age = 20.5 years, and 198 men, M age = 21 years) from four different universities in Turkey participated in a survey with measures of restrictive and permissive messages about sexuality received from various sources, beliefs about sexual roles of men and women in relationships, and questions about a range of sexual experiences, including coital and non-coital. The incidence and characteristics of ideal sexual partnership and incidence and dynamics of experiences involving ""token resistance"" and ""consent to unwanted sex"" were specifically investigated. The results provided a snapshot of the sexual lives of students in this country at the crossroads of secularism and traditional Muslim mores. Both commonalities and differences were found across gender. Both men and women received more restrictive than permissive messages. The most important message source was same-sex friends for men and parents for women. Men had more dating and sexual partners than women. The correlations of religiosity and messages with sexual experiences and attitudes were mostly in the expected direction. Women were more likely to have a token resistance incidence and both genders were equally unlikely to consent to unwanted sex. The results were discussed in relation to the cultural context and the relevant literature, and recommendations are offered for future research. Â© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",1,26

Using qualitative data, queer theory, and the concept tyranny of sexualized spaces, we explain why non-heterosexual students have more negative perceptions of the university climate than heterosexual male students, in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Although heterosexual students see few problems with the campus sexual orientation climate, bisexual men and women describe being challenged on the authenticity of their orientation, and lesbian and, to a greater extent, gay male students report harassment and exclusion in a number of settings. These distinct processes are influenced by broader heteronormative standards. We also shed much-needed light on how gendered sexual performativity double standards within an important campus microclimate (fraternity parties) contribute to creating a tyrannical sexualized space and negatively affect overall campus climate perceptions.

Young people describe and make sense of their experiences by referring to sexual scripts; narrative sequences that represent the legitimate rules and moves of the heterosexual game. The article shows the complex intertwining of compliance with, adaptation and negotiation of, and challenge to gendered sexual scripts. On the one hand, at the beginning of their sexual careers young people follow gendered scripts strongly shaped by a double standard: young men more often place their first sexual intercourse within a context of emotional and relational detachment, while young women tend to interpret their sexual debut as a romantic experience. On the other hand, the research findings point to processes of negotiation and re-definition of scripts based on three different cultural logics: the denaturalization of sexual scripts; the reversal or inversion of gendered scripts; and the convergence with or the construction of a common 'degendering' script.

One argument suggests the revolution is mainly a result of changes among women; the other argument sees new sexual behaviours still reflect pre-existing values in which premarital sex occurs within a 'marital' context. To assess such changes in sexual attitudes and behaviours the most accessible subjects/group are people not in a marital situation. For this reason, high school students provide an appropriate sample for the study. The survey data show that in both countries (1) male students had more sexually permissive attitudes than female students; (2) this 'typical' gender difference on the attitude level was reflected at the behavior level among Taiwanese students, but it was not reflected in the behaviors among Hong Kong students; (3) the more permissive sexual attitudes among Chinese males were not accompanied by more sex knowledge; (4) Hong Kong students had conservative attitudes relative to their behaviors, whereas Taiwanese students had conservative behaviors ralative to their attitudes.

Study 1a showed that female casual sex accepters received more opprobrium than male accepters. Study 1b demonstrated that women were less likely to accept casual sex offers than men and that the gender difference was partially mediated by the more negative judgments women anticipated for accepting the casual sex offer. In Study 2a, participants recalled real-life sexual proposals; women expected to be perceived more negatively than men for accepting an offer of casual sex. Finally, in Study 2b, we demonstrated that fear of stigma mediates gender differences in acceptance of actual recalled casual sex offers. Across the four studies and nearly 3,000 participants, ranging in age from 18 to 74, we examined the role of stigma in men and women's reactions to casual sex and successfully integrated two relatively independent research domains: that of sexuality on one hand, and research on the backlash effects on the other.

(2015",Sexual attitudes in women between the ages of 30-39.,"Sexuality research has primarily utilized a very narrow population, mostly first-year college psychology students, the results of which were then attributed to the greater population. Human development is postulated to be ever changing across a life span, so it makes sense that a woman's attitudes regarding her sexuality would also change over the course of a lifetime. The purpose of this study was to examine the sexual attitudes and behaviors of women in their 30s. The author sought to elicit degree of sexual awareness, willingness to engage in casual sex, and adherence to a sexual double standard from 115 women who filled out four sexuality surveys and answered a number of demographic questions. Exploratory analyses were used to examine associations among responses. Overall the findings reflect that women in their 30s do differ from women in their 20s in terms of their sexuality. They reported being more sexually aware in their 30s than they were in their 20s. Results showed that as sexual experience increased so did sexual awareness. Women in this sample reported a history of engaging and a willingness to engage in casual sex, a lack of adherence to a sexual double standard, and an endorsement of equal sexual standards for men and women. Interestingly, as a woman's income increased, so did her tendency to adhere to the double standard. This was surprising given the other findings, which seem to reflect that the more sexually aware women are the more likely they are to fulfill their desires. The willingness to pursue sexual fulfillment through casual encounters reflects a more liberal attitude, as the woman shows less constraint to fulfill societal expectations regarding women's sexual behavior. Financial independence would be thought to give a woman greater freedom to behave in ways that please her sexually. However, it may be that as a woman competes financially in a male-dominated culture, she feels compelled to conform.

Predictors of abdication and unprotected sex intentions included partner type (new casual versus previous relationship), sexual double standard (SDS) endorsement, and two types of ambivalence. After completing a SDS endorsement measure, women (N = 360) projected themselves into a hypothetical sexual situation and completed dependent measures. In the new casual partner condition, SDS endorsement indirectly negatively predicted unprotected sex intentions through its associations with ambivalence and abdication. In both partner conditions SDS endorsement positively predicted abdication, which then positively predicted unprotected sex intentions. Ambivalence indirectly predicted unprotected sex intentions through its negative association with abdication intentions. Results suggest the importance of ambivalence for sexual decisions and the complexity of understanding the sexual decision making processes for women who endorse the SDS.

Information on direct and indirect sexual messages of parents and Ss' sexual attitudes and satisfaction was gathered. Transactional analysis was used to examine how these messages influenced interpersonal transactions. Findings indicate that the level of direct verbal communication between parents and children on issues related to sexuality was extremely low. Within this low level of direct communication, control topics (topics that restrain sexual interest and activity) were the ones most often addressed, particularly with females. Even in the absence of explicit communications, a great deal of restrictive sexual socialization occurred indirectly within the family. While sexual satisfaction was positive, both males and females heard the double-standard and the save-sex-for-marriage messages as well as negative, restrictive attitudes, although females assimilated these messages more frequently than did males. Females were more inundated with communications regarding the need to delay sex and the necessity of love as a prerequisite. As indicated by the Index of Sexual Attitudes measure, the strong restraining, negative sexual socialization tended to result in problematic attitudes, especially for females.

44,"Dir, A. L. (2018","Effects of sexting on perceptions of sexual intent, sexual consent, and responsibility in sexual encounters.","Sexting has been linked to a range of sexual behaviors, including sexual assault; however, the mechanism through which sexting increases the risk for sexual assault is unknown. One explanation for the role of sexting in sexual assault could be due to gender differences in sexting and sexual communication. The current study examined men's and women's perceptions of sexting as a form of communicating sexual intent and sexual consent, and how sexting influences attributions of responsibility and blame in sexual encounters and alleged sexual assault. Additionally, considering the role of alcohol in sexual assault, the study also examined how both sexting and alcohol influenced individuals' perceptions of a sexual scenario. Method: Using a factorial vignette design, N = 525 college students (48.6% women; 71% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to one of four vignettes regarding a sexual scenario between a man and woman (John and Jennifer), with sexting and/or alcohol involved. Results: Significant differences in sexting vs. texting conditions were seen for perceptions of sexual intent (F = 147.28, p < .01) and sexual consent (F = 105.86, p < .01). Men were more likely to perceive that sexual consent was exchanged (F = 9.16, p < .01) and to interpret the sext as a consent cue (F = 7.82, p < .01). John was attributed more responsibility/blame across all conditions (F = 154.58, p < .01); however, Jennifer was attributed more blame in the sexting conditions (F = 9.16, p < .01). Conclusion: Results suggest that despite sexting as a signal of sexual interest, there are differences in how men and women perceive sexting as sexual consent, which may influence the risk for sexual assault. Additionally, there are differential effects of sexting for men vs. women, such that women may be judged more harshly for sexting, suggesting evidence of the sexual double standard. Results offer important implications for sexual assault prevention and sexual gender roles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",1,44

The sample is composed of 87 women ranging in age from 21 to 56 years and in a committed heterosexual relationship. Participants responded to flyers, internet postings, and emails. Data were collected through mailed surveys. This study utilized a hierarchical regression analysis in order to examine the incremental predictive ability of household labor scores. Results indicated gender role attitude scores significantly predicted attitudes toward sexuality; the more participants endorsed egalitarian gender role attitudes, the more they describe their sexual attitudes as egalitarian. Division of household labor and gender role attitudes significantly predicted sexual behavior when combined, and the unique contribution of household labor scores to the regression was significant; the more participants described egalitarian division of household labor, the more they depicted their sexual behavior as egalitarian.

47,"Bonomi, A. E., et al. (2013",,"Background: While intimate partner violence (IPV) affects 25% of women and impairs health, current societal conditions-including the normalization of abuse in popular culture such as novels, film, and music-create the context to support such violence. Fifty Shades of Grey, a best-selling novel, depicts a ''romantic'' and ''erotic'' relationship involving 28-year-old megamillionaire, Christian Grey, and a 22-year-old college student, Anastasia Steele. We argue that the relationship is characterized by IPV, which is harmful to Anastasia. Methods: All authors engaged in iterative readings of the text, and wrote narrative summaries to elucidate themes. Validity checks included double review of the first eight chapters of the novel to establish consistency in our analysis approach, iterative discussions in-person and electronically to arbitrate discrepancies, and review of our analysis with other abuse and sexual practice experts. To characterize IPV, we used the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions of emotional abuse (intimidation/threats; isolation; stalking; and humiliation) and sexual violence (forced sex acts/contact against a person's will, including using alcohol/drugs or intimidation/pressure). To characterize harm, we used Smith's conceptualizations of perceived threat, managing, altered identity, yearning, entrapment, and disempowerment experienced by abused women. Results: Emotional abuse is present in nearly every interaction, including: stalking (Christian deliberately follows Anastasia and appears in unusual places, uses a phone and computer to track Anastasia's whereabouts, and delivers expensive gifts); intimidation (Christian uses intimidating verbal and nonverbal behaviors, such as routinely commanding Anastasia to eat and threatening to punish her); and isolation (Christian limits Anastasia's social contact). Sexual violence is pervasive-including using alcohol to compromise Anastasia's consent, as well as intimidation (Christian initiates sexual encounters when genuinely angry, dismisses Anastasia's requests for boundaries, and threatens her). Anastasia experiences reactions typical of abused women, including: constant perceived threat (''my stomach churns from his threats''); altered identity (describes herself as a ''pale, haunted ghost''); and stressful managing (engages in behaviors to ''keep the peace,'' such as withholding information about her social whereabouts to avoid Christian's anger). Anastasia becomes disempowered and entrapped in the relationship as her behaviors become mechanized in response to Christian's abuse. Conclusions: Our analysis identified patterns in Fifty Shades that reflect pervasive intimate partner violence-one of the biggest problems of our time. Further, our analysis adds to a growing body of literature noting dangerous violence standards being perpetuated in popular culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,47

Participants included 182 heterosexual men and 206 heterosexual women enrolled in undergraduate clinical and counseling courses at a mid-sized Midwestern university. Data collected on each respondent was derived from five sources (1) a written sexual fantasy, (2) the Extended Personal Attributes Questionnaire (EPAQ), (3) Human Sexuality Questionnaire - The Heterosexual Experience Subscale, (4) the Sexual Opinion Survey (SOS), and (5) the Revised Mosher Guilt Inventory. The Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) (Whissell, 1999) was used to obtain two quantitative measures, Activation and Evaluation of the emotional tone of the sexual fantasies. The variables of the study were gender role variables (agency and communion) and sex variables (erotophobia-erotophilia, sex experience, sex guilt, Activation and Evaluation). It was hypothesized that men would score higher on agency, sexual experience, erotophilia, and Activation, which is associated with arousal and action, and women would score higher on communion, erotophobia, sex guilt and Evaluation, which is associated with pleasant feelings. Gender differences were found for all variables except sexual experience and the measures of emotion, Activation and Evaluation. Given the stated hypotheses, canonical correlations were performed to determine the linear relationship of gender role and sex variables for men and women. One significant canonical correlation was found for men indicating that as agency, erotophilia, and sexual experience increase, sex guilt decreases. No significant canonical correlation was found for women. A discriminant analysis was performed to determine if the gender role variables and the sex variables were strong discriminators of sex. Results indicated that communion and erotophobia were the best discriminators for men and women. The study's present findings are discussed in terms of the sexual double standard and the changing social values of women in today's society. Limitations of the study and future directions of research in sexual fantasies and gender differences, specifically in terms of application to counseling are discussed.

49,"Eaton, A. A. and A. Matamala (2014",The relationship between heteronormative beliefs and verbal sexual coercion in college students.,"Heteronormative standards for sex and romance situate men and women in a hierarchical relationship that characterizes masculinity as active and persistent and femininity as passive and responsive to male sexuality. Individuals who endorse heteronormative beliefs, such as the belief that men should dominate women sexually or that men are always ready for sex, may therefore be more approving of and experienced with behaviors that involve one partner exerting sexual pressure on the other. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the endorsement of heteronormative beliefs and men's and women's approval of and experience with verbal sexual coercion (both as a perpetrator and as a victim). We first established a gender-neutral higher-order construct representing heteronormative beliefs consisting of multiple measures of gender norms for sexuality and relationships in a sample of 555 heterosexual college students (292 women, 263 men) primarily of Hispanic origin. We next found that endorsement of heteronormative beliefs was positively correlated with personal acceptance of verbal sexual coercion strategies and personal experience as the victim and perpetrator of verbal sexual coercion for both men and women. While men reported more overall support for heteronormative beliefs and more experience as a victim and perpetrator of verbal sexual coercion, there were minimal gender differences in how heteronormative beliefs related to verbal sexual coercion variables. The positive association found between heteronormative beliefs and sexual coercion in young men's and women's relationships represents an important step towards better understanding the antecedents and consequences of intimate partner violence.

For the entire sample, 26 of the 38 items showed statistically significant gender differences. For Hispanics only, 23 of the 38 items showed statistically significant differences, with gender differences those of the sample as whole. There were 8 statistically significant differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic students, with Hispanic students tending to be more conservative.

Nevertheless, endorsement and enactment of the SDS is still common. In this study, we respond to recent calls for modernization in the field of sexual double standard research. We describe the development of the ""Scale for the Assessment of Sexual Standards among Youth"" (SASSY), as well as its psychometric properties. This instrument was designed to measure contemporary sexual double standard endorsement, defined as ""the degree to which an individual's attitude reflects a divergent set of expectations for boys and girls, in that boys are expected to be relatively more sexually active, assertive, and knowledgeable and girls are expected to be relatively more sexually reserved, passive, and inexperienced"" among adolescents and emerging adults. In Study 1, a pool of 35 items was administered in a Dutch sample (N = 465, 54.8% female, age 16-20). A 20-item set formed a one-dimensional and internally consistent scale and was subsequently administered in a second Dutch sample. Study 2 (N = 818, 58.4% female, age 16-25) again assessed the 20-item set. After dropping one item, the 19-item SASSY proved to be one-dimensional and internally consistent, exhibiting good test-retest reliability, construct validity, and convergent validity. Finally, the instrument showed configural and metric measurement invariance across gender, age, education level, and sexual experience level, and configural, metric, and scalar measurement invariance across time. These studies confirmed the 19-item SASSY to be a reliable and valid new tool for the assessment of contemporary sexual double standard endorsement among adolescents and emerging adults.

Knowledge about the relationship between gender norms and sexual cognitions and emotions might further the understanding of continued gender-norm conformity. In the present study, we investigated whether and how gendered sexual attitudes are related to (positive and negative) sex-related emotions, via sexual cognitions (autonomy, body esteem, and approach/avoidance motives for sex). A survey was submitted to 293 heterosexually identified, sexually active, Dutch (central and southern regions) 18-25 year-olds. Results from a moderated mediation model (using structural equation modeling) revealed that women, but not men, who more strongly endorsed traditional gender-related sexual attitudes experienced significantly less positive and more negative emotions, as a result of decreased sexual autonomy and sexual body esteem as well as increased avoidance motives for sex. We conclude that, as a result of negative cognitions associated with the endorsement of traditional gender norms, women in particular are at risk of experiencing negative emotional outcomes in the sexual context. We argue that sexual cognitions and emotions deserve explicit attention in sex-positive and gender-transformative sexuality education, which has been proven to be a vital resource for achieving increased gender-equity in sexual and romantic relationships.

SDS endorsement was assessed using a newly developed instrument, the Scale for the Assessment of Sexual Standards Among Youth (SASSY). Gender (being male) and religiousness were significantly associated with increased SDS endorsement. For both boys and girls, increased feelings of entitlement to self-induced sexual pleasure (e.g., masturbation) were significantly associated with reduced SDS endorsement, whereas higher gender investment was significantly associated with increased SDS endorsement. Furthermore, increased feelings of entitlement to partner-induced sexual pleasure and more frequent talking about sexuality with peers were associated with increased SDS endorsement among boys but not among girls. We conclude that future research should explore peer influence processes through peer communication about sex, gender investment, and feelings of entitlement to both self and partner-induced sexual pleasure.

Objective: We examine gender differences in attitudes toward casual sex. We also assess whether there is a double standard whereby women are judged more harshly for casual sex. Methods: We use a large online survey of U.S. university students to examine gender differences with regard to attitudes and reports of sexual behavior. Results: While distributions overlap, the average man looks more favorably on casual sex than the average woman. Both sexes show substantial openness to relationships. We find evidence of a double standard: men are more judgmental toward women than toward men who have casual sex. Men appear to over-report and/or women to under-report intercourse and fellatio, suggesting that men see these acts as enhancing and/or women see them as diminishing their status. Conclusions: Women face more negative judgment than men when they are known to engage in casual sex, and they also report less interest in casual sex than men. Our analysis does not permit us to assess whether the double standard we find evidence of explains why women have less interest in casual sex, but we hypothesize that this is the case.

Using Carpenter's framework as a starting point, scale items were developed based on the conceptual understanding of the three metaphors.

Findings indicated that Catholic adolescents engaged in sexual intercourse at later ages than nonreligious adolescents.

The findings demonstrated that the rates of masturbation (11.1%) and premarital sexual intercourse (4.3%) were much lower in women than in men (87.7% and 44.2% respectively) who were traditionally expected to maintain their virginity until marriage. A higher degree of commitment to religious faith was associated with a lower rate of masturbation and sexual contact experience. Also, the myth that the hymen symbolized virginity was slightly more prevalent among male students (74.2% vs. 72.1%). Female virginity was significantly more important among male students (76.7%) than females (11.1%), and male students more frequently (30.1% vs. 11.1%) stated that ""the blood-stained bed sheet"" should be displayed to the family on the day of marriage. Although some myths about virginity were frequently reported by females, less significance was attributed to virginity by females than by males.

This pattern imitates rejection of female agency in employment contexts (e.g., competing for leadership roles; Rudman, Moss-Racusin, Phelan, & Nauts, 2012). Female agency, whether sexual or professional, evokes perceptions that targets are ""too dominant,"" which results in social or economic penalties. The current study sought to conceptually replicate Infanger et al.'s findings while examining three potential moderators of the dominance penalty for sexually powerful women. Specifically, sexually powerful women may be viewed as too dominant because they (1) threaten men's higher status (the status incongruity hypotheses; Rudman et al., 2012), (2) decrease the value of other women's sexual favors (sexual economics theory; Baumeister & Vohs, 2004), or (3) threaten women's protected status, which depends on women being chaste and submissive (the male protection hypothesis). However, results did not support a dominance penalty for female sexual power. Instead, male and female targets who espoused a powerful, manipulative form of sexuality, compared to those who did not, were (1) viewed as more dominant and less communal, (2) disliked, and (3) sabotaged on a future task. Further, results of mediation analyses were consistent with the idea that sexually powerful targets, compared to low power targets, were sabotaged because they were disliked, and disliked because they were viewed as less communal, not too dominant.

The correlation between parentsâ and childrenâs attitudes were high for all the early adolescents and low for all the middle adolescents.

Middle adolescents had significantly more permissive sexual attitudes than early and late adolescents. Gender variables were also studied, but conclusions were limited due to the small number of participating fathers. AH findings must be tempered with the recognition of the possible sampling bias introduced by the use of a convenience sample.

Men and women in the permissive condition were more likely to report extradyadic involvement than those in the conservative condition. Men in the conservative condition reported an older age at first intercourse and fewer lifetime and one-time only sexual partners than did men who did not overhear a conversation. Men's and women's reports of sexual attitudes were unaffected by the manipulation. That a transient social norm had an impact on reports of sexual behavior lends support to the notion that some apparent sex differences in sexual behavior are at least partially reporting differences due to the influence of differential social norms.

Previous research has focused on how pornography relates to many factors including sexual risks, sexual permissiveness, violence, rape myth acceptance, and sexual behaviors. Much of this research, though, has been unable to identify the direction of the relationship between viewing sexually explicit material and various sexual attitudes and behaviors, and rarely studies a sample that is representative of the U.S. adult population. Instead, much of the research on pornography has relied on college student samples or other convenience samples. My study addresses these gaps by exploring a wide range of sexual behaviors and attitudes through surveying a sample of respondents who participate in online survey research panels. By accessing online survey panels, researchers are able to specify the demographics they would like their particular sample to reflect. For this study, a sample has been selected to reflect the U.S. population on age, race, and gender. To better assess the directionality of the relationship between exposure to sexually explicit material and respondents' sexual behaviors and attitudes, I have included several closed-ended items that may help to better identify the temporal order of these variables. Additionally, I have used open-ended questions to provide a more in-depth account of respondents' perceptions of pornography and how it relates to their sexual behaviors and relationships. Findings suggest that not only are there correlations between viewing pornography and the sexual acts participants engage in and find arousing, but that the material individuals are exposed to may be shaping their behaviors and attitudes.

In both ethnic groups, men demonstrated stronger double standards than did women. Both Whites and Asians, regardless of gender, reported more conservative sexual attitudes for choosing marriage partners than in judging people in general. In the case of Asians, American acculturation and Asian cultural affiliation had limited and gender-specific effects on endorsement of sexual double standards.

Shifting standards theory (Biernat In The shifting standards model: Implications of stereotype accuracy for social judgment, APA, Washington DC, 1995) suggests that individuals will judge female targets more harshly than male targets, based on culturally ingrained stereotypes regarding sexual behavior. On the contrary, intergroup bias theory (Brewer In Psychol Bull 86:307-324, 1979) predicts that individuals will judge outgroup targets, or members of the opposite sex, more harshly than ingroup targets, or members of the same sex. Participants were shown a hard copy of presumable evidence that extradyadic computer-mediated behavior had occurred, engaged in by one of two members of a couple. The two groups differed only by the sex of the target, the female ""Colleen"" or the male ""Bill"". Then participants reported their attitudes toward the target's behavior, resulting distress, and likelihood to terminate the relationship. Results showed support for the intergroup bias theory, suggesting that individuals altered their attitudes toward the behavior based on whether the target was an ingroup or outgroup member.

On the basis of their response patterns to a set of Guttman scale items, the students were classified into three standards: abstinence, double standard, and the single standard of permissiveness. A racial comparison of the Mississippi sample with Reiss' Virginia student sample revealed striking similarities with one exception--a significantly higher proportion of Mississippi whites endorsed permissiveness without affection. The Mississippi data, however, failed to give strong support to the presumed prevalence of the double standard. Moreover, several social factors examined appeared to influence the standards of whites and females to a greater extent than those of Negroes and males.

83,"Hearn, K. D. (2001",Predictors of health protective sexual communication among black women and men.,"Black women and men continue to be disproportionately infected with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Although Blacks represent only 12% of the U.S. population, they comprised 45% of the new AIDS cases reported in 1998 (National Minority AIDS Council, 2000). In an effort to intervene on this health crisis, researchers have explored factors that influence health protective behaviors such as condom use. However, virtually nothing is known about factors that influence health protective sexual communication among Blacks. The present study fills this gap in the literature on Black adults' sexual health by examining the extent to which individual level, cultural level, and psychosocial level variables inform health protective sexual communication among Black adults. More specifically, drawing on data from a sample of 96 Black adults from Georgia, Michigan, and New York, this study investigated the roles of gender, conceptualizations of womanhood/manhood, the sexual double standard, the importance of romantic relationships, perceived control, trust, and communalism in health protective sexual communication. The results revealed that gender and power play important roles in health protective sexual communication for Black women and men. Gender emerged as a significant predictor of sexual communication, indicating that women are more communicative. Additionally, both adherence to the traditional sexual double standard and perceived personal control emerged as positive predictors of health protective sexual communication. The implications of these findings for theory, psychotherapy, and prevention interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,83

89,"Huppin, M. (2007",Women as sexual ,"A wealth of evidence indicates that sex differences between men and women in casual sexual attitudes and behaviors are quite large. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology a prevailing dynamic of female sexual selectivity is a sensible result. In particular, parental investment theory predicts that women should be quite discerning in their sexual choices. While an evolutionary perspective on women's sexual selectivity is valuable, it is also susceptible to oversimplification when it is assumed ipso facto that women who behave selectively are also behaving adaptively. This view takes for granted complex determinants of female sexual behavior, potentially undervaluing the contribution of proximate environmental inputs to women's sexual behaviors. The present research creates an analogue to women's sexual behaviors from an existing literature on women's dieting behaviors. The dieting literature has established that women are unable to maintain their diets during performance of a cognitively demanding task or during related states that may similarly constrain cognitive capacity, e.g., when feeling anxious, depressed, or intoxicated. Presumably, this is because cognitive load serves to reduce the impact of unfeasible social prescriptions (i.e., maintaining society's thin ideal) on behavior by diminishing their association with monitoring of current behaviors. Considering women as sexual ""dieters"" confronted with similarly unfeasible standards for sexual behaviors (e.g., the sexual double standard), three studies investigated the hypothesis that many women today, far from behaving in accord with evolutionary dictates, are actually overly inhibited in their casual sexual behaviors relative to what might be deemed evolutionarily or reproductively optimal levels of behavior. It was predicted that women under high cognitive load for reasons of anxiety, depression, or by virtue of performing a cognitively demanding task would be disinhibited in their casual sexual behaviors relative to baseline levels. It was further predicted that this effect would be most evident in women who acknowledged higher positive sexual ideation to have sex when exposed to a casual sex scenario. Cognitive load was not expected to affect men, since men are not thought to be under high inhibitory conflict where sex is involved. Likening men to non-dieters in respect of sex, male participants were anticipated to behave solely based on self-perceived positive sexual ideation to engage in sex. The results of these experiments support the proposed theory of women as sexual dieters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,89
90,"Hynie, M. (1997","Women's perceptions of a contraceptive behavior: Exploring sexual attitudes, social norms, and the sexual double bind.","Five studies examined the possible influence of the sexual double standard on women's contraceptive behavior via sexual attitudes and social norms. In Study 1, longitudinal diary data from a community sample of 62 women showed that women's contraceptive behavior in ongoing sexual relationships was quadratically associated with sexual attitude. Study 2 showed that contraceptive behavior in initial and ongoing sexual encounters differed significantly in a sample of 52 university women. In initial encounters there was a greater reliance on condoms and a greater risk of unprotected intercourse. Studies 3, 4 and 5 used a person perception paradigm to examine women's perceptions of a female contraceptive provider in an initial sexual encounter. In Study 3, 57 women rated a female condom provider in a casual encounter as less nice, less socially acceptable, and her behavior as less appropriate than when her partner provided a condom. However, the target was rated as less wise if she had unprotected intercourse. In Study 4 (N = 249), a pill condition was added and the influence of sexual attitudes was assessed. Relative to when her partner provided a condom, women rated the target as less wise and less nice if she was on the pill, but they rated her as more wise when she provided a condom. Negative sexual attitudes were associated with more negative reactions but generally did not interact with contraceptive condition. In Study 5, 96 women rated the target as a function of who provided a condom (her vs. him) and four properties of the romantic relationship. Providing a condom did not result in negative evaluations in a committed relationship. In a non-committed relationship, when the woman provided a condom she was perceived as less nice but more wise. Furthermore, women used intimacy as a cue for commitment, but did not perceive intimacy alone as adequate justification for intercourse. The results of these five studies suggest that social norms may exist which discourage contraceptive preparedness in initial sexual encounters and that the influence of these social norms may not be limited to casual sexual encounters.

Tanaka (1973",Predictors of behavior: Attitudinal and other variables (I).,"The purpose of the present study was to specify the conditions under which an attitude of a given type is or is not related to behavior of a given type, and to search for other variables influencing prediction of behavior. Fishbein's theory was tested in the context of actual behaviors such as blood-donation, smoking, cheating in college, premarital sexual intercourse, and train riding without a ticket. A simplified version of the theoretical model was used. According to the model, a person's behavior (B) is a function of his behavioral intention (BI), which is determined by his attitude toward the act (Aact) and his beliefs about the expectations of others, i.e., social-normative-beliefs (NBs). This can be seen in the following algebraic expression: BâBI=[Aact]w0+[Î£NBs]w1 where B=overt behavior; BI=behavioral intention; Aact=attitude toward performing a given behavior in a given situation (i.e., attiude toward the act); NBs=beliefs about the expectations of others, i.e., social-normative-beliefs; and w0 and w1=empirically-determined weights. A questionnaire was administered to 404 male and female students in the first session, and 413 in the second. Aact was measured on four seven-point Semantic Differential scales with high loadings on the evaluative factor. Three kinds of NBs were measured on sevenpoint scales: beliefs about expectation of family (FaNBs) of friends (FrNBs) of others in general (GeNBs). Both the sum of the three NBs and the individual NBs were used in the analysis. Others' attitudes toward the act (Aacto)âan alternative variable for NBsâwere included in the questionnaire, and measured in a manner similar to Aact. BI was also measured on a seven-point scale. Three indices concerning B were measured. As for the other variables, the kind of behavior and the sex of the actor were also considered in the analysis. The effects of these two situational variables on weights in the model's equation were examined using regression analysis. It was found that, (a) Aact and NBs were effective as preditors of behavior, and including NBs increased the accuracy of prediction beyond Aact alone and (b) the relative importance of Aact and NBs in predicting BI and B varied with the kind of behavior and the actor's sex. As for smoking and premarital sexual intercourse, female subjects were more influenced by NBs than males. The reference groups varied with the kind of behavior and the actor's sex. Correlation between BI and B was high (.79) on smoking but low (.31) on blood donation. Although standardized regression coefficients decreased with B, the rattitudes toward the actelative weights which were carried by Aact and NBs were almost the same on BI. Additional examination showed that Aacto was less effective than NBs. Other variables, such as personality and habit, were discussed with respect to inconsistency between attitude measures and overt behavior or inconsistency between BI and B.

(1997","Sexual attitudes and behavior of never-married, rural Thai youth.","The focus of this study was to examine the sexual attitudes and behavior of rural Thai youth and how these are affected by the social context in which they live, in addition to individual characteristics. Individual characteristics, family factors, and peer experiences were expected to influence youths' sexual attitudes and behavior. The data used in the study were gathered in a survey of 577 never-married males and 517 females aged 15 through 24 years who lived in rural areas of the North and the Northeast of Thailand. Ordinary least squares regression and multinomial logistic regression were the techniques used to examine sexual attitudes and current patterns of sexual behavior among male youth respectively. Focus group discussions involving parents and youth were used to extend the interpretation of the survey data. It is found that in general, female sexual attitudes and behavior were bound by cultural obligations and constrained by parental control, but both males and females were influenced by peers and exposure to modernization. Approximately half of never-married young males respondents had already experienced sexual intercourse while only 2 percent of never-married females did so. Two factors that significantly contributed to explaining the variation in sexual attitudes among males are sex-role attitudes and early sexual experience. For females, important factors influencing their sexual attitudes are sex-role attitudes, early sexual experience, region of residence, parent-child communication and having sexually experienced friends. The analysis of current patterns of male sexual behavior showed that those who lived in the North were more likely to have sex with paid partners, and to have multiple sex partners, as compared to northeastern male respondents. In-school students were less likely to report risky sexual behavior than were their out-of-school counterparts. Qualitative data emphasized the impact of social norms supporting a double-standard related to sexual attitudes and behavior among young rural Thai youth. Parents rarely discuss sex with their children, while continuing to reinforce sex-role stereotypes that identify male promiscuity as acceptable, whereas female sexuality is expected to follow marriage.

However, the reasons for this deterrence may differ between men and women, such that women focus on practical concerns over suitability whereas men focus on reputation. Thus, individuals with extensive sexual histories, who are currently monogamous, should be more acceptable to women than they are to men. Two studies supported this hypothesis. Study 1 found that women rated male targets with a sexually experienced past with increased desirability for a long-term relationship if they reported recent shifts towards monogamy. In contrast, men rated sexually experienced female targets, with a recent shift towards monogamy, as least desirable. Study 2 extended the understanding of this effect by demonstrating that one time sexual experiences (i.e., threesome) had no effect on women's judgments of currently monogamous men, but continued to negatively affect men's judgments of currently monogamous women.

While males felt their friends approved of premarital intercourse, females felt their having had intercourse would be disapproved of by friends, family, and society alike. It appears that the female's liberal sexual behavior occurred in a setting where she perceived little support for such behavior. Evidence was also found that the more physically attractive college woman, while differing little from less attractive women in sexual attitudes and values, had more noncoital and coital experience.

Relegated to the realm of commercial media, rather than rational discourse in families, schools, and the general public, young people receive mixed messages about this non-reproductive sexual behavior. In order to explore how young adults have learned about masturbation and currently perceive masturbation, we conducted a grounded theory study of 72 college students (56 females; 16 males) enrolled in a human sexuality class. Findings revealed that a young adult's perceptions of and feelings toward masturbation were the result of a developmental process that included: (1) learning about the act of masturbation and how to do it, (2) learning and internalizing the social contradiction of stigma and taboo surrounding this pleasurable act, and (3) coming to terms with this tension between stigma and pleasure. Although nearly all participants learned about masturbation through the media and peers (not parents or teachers), gender was salient in coming to terms with the contradiction of stigma and pleasure. Most of the women reported either still struggling with the contradiction or accepting it as normal. Most of the men recognized the beneficial aspects for healthy sexual development that result from masturbation. Both male and female participants identified differential sexual scripts as contributing to the double standard. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,107

Sexual double standards and power in heterosexual college hookups.,"Although college hookups are typically enjoyable for both men and women, heterosexual hookups often involve inequitable power dynamics that privilege men (e.g., women perform sexual acts to please partners and/or succumb to pressure for intercourse). Some scholars have attributed this power imbalance to the traditional double standard. However, recent studies have indicated college students typically endorse egalitarian standards-and some endorse a reverse double standard in which they negatively judge men more than women for engaging in the same sexual behavior. Using Online College Social Life Survey data (N = 11,077) I examined relationships between endorsement of double standards and power in hookups. Because contemporary students often believe double standards exist in society but not in their own minds, I also examined relationships between feeling negatively judged for hooking up and power. Most respondents endorsed egalitarian standards, but women were more likely than men to feel judged for hooking up. Feeling judged was a significant predictor of power disadvantages for women and men; endorsing a double standard disparaging one's own gender was significant among men. Findings suggest contemporary relevance of the traditional double standard and highlight differences between women's and men's endorsement of double standards disparaging their own gender.

Study 1a and 1b focused on menâs evaluations of sexual script deviation in women (i.e., sexually assertive behavior) and the possible disapproval of these behaviors (backlash effects). Participants (381 and 382 self-identified heterosexual men) were presented with a randomly assigned vignette describing a hypothetical sexual scenario in which a woman behaved either sexually assertive or sexually timid. Both studies indicated that men to some extent expressed disapproval of sexually assertive women. With the aim to assess if backlash effects were due to womenâs sexual script deviation or if there was an overall negative evaluation of sexually assertive behavior irrespective of the targetâs gender, in Study 2 we focused on the perception of sexually assertive behavior in both women and men (N = 268).

(college students).,"Traditionally, there has existed a double standard regarding sexuality. At one time, premarital intercourse was tolerated for men but not for women (Reiss, 1971). Recently, however, research has debated the continued existence of a double standard regarding sexual activity; While some researchers attest to its continued prevalence, others proclaim that with the sexual revolution of the 1960s came the ""death of the double standard"" and a new equality in the standard for acceptable sexual behavior. However, while the majority of research has focused on personal attitudes, few studies have examined subjective norms or individuals' beliefs about how significant others would view women and men engaging in comparable sexual behavior. In addition, prior research has addressed perceptions of only limited sexual behaviors. In the context of relevant theory emphasizing the importance subjective norms in predicting behavior, the current study examined college students' (N = 219) personal responses and their predictions of how others (i.e., date, partner) would respond to women versus men depicted in eight brief scenarios as engaging in assertive or permissive sexual activities. In addition, general social acceptability of the women and men depicted in sexual scenarios, as well as participants' personal sexual practices were assessed. It was hypothesized that a sexual double standard continues to be endorsed, and that the double standard may be more evident in college students' subjective norms for appropriate female sexual behavior. Results showed mixed support for the hypotheses. While more permissive behaviors were considered less socially acceptable for females, college students' personal ratings and their predictions of others' ratings did not demonstrate a significant double standard against women overall. Females indicating a greater level of personal sexual assertiveness tended to endorse more equitable standards for women and men on a measure of the sexual double standard. However, females' personal experience with behaviors described in scenarios was not found to be related to their ratings of women versus men. Methodology limitations in the study of the sexual double standard, as well as implications for future research and safe sex education are discussed.

We hypothesized the existence of a sexual double standard, such that female actors would be more condemned than males. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that respondents were more condemning of female than male victims, regardless of which act was depicted. Furthermore, male respondents were more condemning of a female perpetrator of statutory rape than of her male victim, and also more condemning of a female victim than of her male perpetrator, whereas female respondents did not differentiate between the victim and perpetrator, regardless of the depicted victim gender or sexual act. That is, whether she was depicted as the victim or perpetrator of the act, the female was more condemned than her male counterpart. Overall, female respondents were more condemning than male respondents, regardless of which act was depicted.

According to the sexual double standard, boys and men are rewarded and praised for heterosexual sexual contacts, whereas girls and women are derogated and stigmatized for similar behaviors. Although widely held by the general public, research findings on the sexual double standard remain equivocal, with qualitative studies and early attitudinal surveys generally finding evidence of the double standard and more recent experimental vignette designs often failing to find similar results. In this study, we extend prior research by directly measuring the social status of sexually permissive youth. We use data collected from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to relate adolescents' self-reported numbers of sexual partners to a network measure of peer acceptance. Results suggest that the association between lifetime sexual partnerships and peer status varies significantly by gender, such that greater numbers of sexual partners are positively correlated with boys 'peer acceptance, but negatively correlated with girls 'peer acceptance. Moreover, the relationship between boys 'sexual behaviors and peer acceptance is moderated by socioeconomic origins; sexually permissive boys from disadvantaged backgrounds are predicted to have more friendships than permissive boys from more advantaged backgrounds. Our results thus support the existence of an adolescent sexual double standard and suggest that sexual norms vary by both gender and socioeconomic origins.

Results thus suggest that peers enforce traditional sexual scripts for both ""heavy"" and ""light"" sexual behaviors during adolescence.

ANCOVAs controlling for ageist and sexist beliefs revealed the ageist double standard; the elderly were perceived to be less interested in sex overall than the young. There was also a sexual double standard; women were perceived to be more interested in traditional sex than men, and men more interested in experimental sex than women. For traditional sex, women perceived younger targets as more interested than the older targets, and women targets as more interested than men. For experimental sex, a three-way interaction showed the interplay between the sexual and ageist double standards. Elderly female targets were perceived as least interested, and young male targets as most interested. Results reinforce that the current sexual standards distinguish between sex for intimacy and sex for other reasons (e.g., pleasure) and that the standards are particularly restrictive for older women.

(2010","Let's talk about sex...education: Exploring youth perspectives, implicit messages, and unexamined implications of sex education in schools.","School-based sexuality education is a critical source of sexual communication for youth in the United States. Although some research exists on the types of sexual communication and ""sex education"" that young people receive, there exist numerous gaps in the literature. Specifically, research examining school-based sex education tends to evaluate programs based on behavioral outcomes (such as onset of vaginal intercourse, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases). Although this information is valuable, it is incomplete. Little is known about other possible effects of sex education, especially in terms of sexual negotiation and messages regarding gender and power. Additionally, young people's own voices and experiences are rarely included. My dissertation addresses some of these gaps in a mixed methods approach, through three studies: 1) A quantitative study examining links between sex education content and sexual attitudes and experiences; 2) A quantitative study examining links between sexual socialization discourses received from sex education programs and sexual attitudes and experiences; and 3) A qualitative study of focus groups with first-year undergraduate college students inquiring about their experiences and perspectives regarding their secondary sex education. In Study 1, participants received more messages about biology and mainstream contraception than other topics, and messages about contraception and lifestyle choices were linked with more sexual agency. In Study 2, participants received more messages about sex being egalitarian, and sex as an expression of love, than other discourses. Sexual double standard messages were linked with more experiences of sexual coercion across groups. Findings from Study 3 revealed three central trends: participants seemed to receive either messages about biology and contraception or messages about abstinence and relationships, but not both; messages were gendered; and a victim-perpetrator dichotomy emerged. Sexual health is a complex issue. School-based sex education may have a variety of effects on sexual attitudes and experiences. It is important to pay more attention to the explicit and implicit messages communicated about power and gender by sex education programs.

Among models for scaling analysis, the Guttman scaling model and two latent class models - the latent-distance model and Goodman's scale model - were employed to examine the scalability of the scale measures. The data were drawn from the 2002 Taiwan Social Change Survey (Questionnaire No. 2), conducted by Academia Sinica. A total of 1983 completed interviews were obtained. This study found that the measures of intimacy permissiveness scale (IPS) were able to form a reasonable Guttman-type scale based on three scaling models. In order to understand whether the attitudinal patterns of Taiwanese toward premarital intimacy permissiveness, particularly the existence of sexual double standards, are consistent with those suggested by the previous literature, we conducted multinomial logistic regression of socio-demographic variables on the scale. Gender and age differences were found consistent with previous studies and mostly reconfirmed the appropriateness of the measures of IPS designed for the Taiwan Social Change Survey.

Reiss's (1967) premarital sexual permissiveness theory were tested, extended, and reformulated through a path analysis on a random sample of 421 college students. The propositions were concerned with the effect of perceived closeness to the sexual standards of parents, peers, and close friends, and of family responsibility and courtship involvement of self-permissiveness. Religiosity and perceived parental liberality were added in refined path models, with a considerable gain in explained variation in permissiveness. Over 50% of the variation in both female and male permissiveness could be predicted from the path models. Reiss's basic propositions are only partially supported: Closeness to mother's sexual standards was considerably more predictive of self-permissiveness than was obvious in Reiss's theory, whereas closeness to friends' and peers' standards received more emphasis. Further refinements and tests of the proposed conceptual changes are offered. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,134

Girls in the study were no more likely than boys to sext; however, they were more likely to experience pressure to do so, particularly from boys. Girls were commonly judged harshly whether they sexted (e.g., ""slut"") or not (e.g., ""prude""), whereas boys were virtually immune from criticism regardless. Older adolescents described sexting as occurring primarily within the context of flirting, romance, or sex, whereas younger adolescents reported what might be described as ""pre-sexting"" behaviors, involving the joking exchange of sexually suggestive (but nonnude) photos with platonic friends. Although some adolescents expressed a fear that sexting might lead to reputational damage, the normative climate and desire for approval motivated some to sext regardless.

This research uses a sample of adolescent women to examine the social consequences of reporting a greater number of sex partners. The research explores whether there are broader social costs and feelings of low self-worth associated with a high number of sex partners, and also focuses on characteristics of the adolescents' close friends. The analyses of quantitative data (n = 600) provide support for the emphasis on the adolescents' immediate network of friends: Friends' attitudes and behaviors were significant predictors of respondents' own sexual experiences, while those reporting a higher number of sex partners did not report a lack of popularity, desire for more friends, or lower self-esteem. In-depth relationship history narratives collected from a subset of respondents (n = 46) provide additional context. Women often recognized the existence of a double standard on a societal or school level, but support or acceptance provided by the more immediate network of similarly situated friends serves as a buffer against such negative attributions. The findings suggest that programs targeting sexual behaviors should focus on how peer norms influence girls' sexual choices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,137

David (2018",Valuation of women's virginity in the Philippines.,"Despite increasing sexual liberalization, virginity and its loss persist as contested and highly gendered concepts in many parts of Asia. According to theories in feminism and sexuality studies, virginity may be socially constructed as either a gift, a stigma, an act of worship, or a process. This paper examines the socially constructed values and meanings ascribed to women's virginity in the context of the Philippines. We synthesize findings from quantitative sources and original qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with Filipino women and men. Subsequent analysis of these findings indicated that a strong, widespread importance is ascribed to women's virginity. While men endorsed female virginity as important prior to marriage, women reported even more restrictive views-including legitimizing beliefs linking virginity to women's worth and to the avoidance of marital conflict. Filipina women expressed disapproval of sex for unmarried women, but less for unmarried men, and placed less importance on male virginity. The evidence indicates the presence of a sexual double standard and supports the argument that women themselves may endorse cultural belief systems that restrict female sexuality. Female virginity was dominantly constructed either as a gift (an embodied resource given by women to men) or, more often, as a prize to be claimed by men from women within the context of heterosexual marriage. Male virginity, in contrast, was largely viewed as a stigma. Virginity loss was not construed as a normative developmental process, nor, despite the predominance of Roman Catholicism in Philippine culture, a sacred act with religious underpinnings.

It focuses on young peopleâs engagement with the construction of an online identity on social media through pictures, and explores how peer-mediated conventions of self-presentation are appropriated, legitimated, or resisted in pre-teensâ and teenagersâ discourses. In doing so, we draw on Goffmanâs (1959) work on the presentation of self and âimpression managementâ to frame our analysis. Mobile communication and social network sites serve an important role in the process of self-presentation and emancipation, providing âfull-timeâ access to peers and peer culture. Our findings suggest that there are gender differences and the presence of sexual double standards in peer normative discourses. Girls are positioned as being more subjected to peer mediation and pressure. Boys blame girls for posing sexy in photos, and negatively sanction this behaviour as being aimed at increasing oneâs popularity online or as an indicator of âa certain type of girl.â However, girls who post provocative photos chose to conform to a sexualised stereotype as a means of being socially accepted by peers. Moreover, they identify with the pressure to always look âperfectâ in their online pictures. While cross-national variations do exist, this sexual double standard is observed in all three countries. These insights into current behaviours could be further developed to determine policy guidance for supporting young people as they learn to manage image laden social media.

(2019",Femsex: A quantitative study of a sex-positive female sexuality education course.,"Initiated at the University of California, Berkeley in 1994, FemSex is a unique peer-led, sex-positive, female sexuality education course. Unlike traditional school-based sexuality education courses that tend to focus narrowly on risk prevention, FemSex seeks to empower participants by providing comprehensive information about anatomy and physiology, deconstructing social scripts related to gender and sexuality, developing media literacy, and building communication skills. The course also fosters a sense of community inclusive to people of varying gender, sexual, ethnic, and religious identities. This study sought to measure the impact of participation in FemSex on participants' sexual subjectivity, a multidimensional construct including sexual body-esteem, entitlement to sexual pleasure from self and partner, self-efficacy in achieving sexual pleasure, and sexual self-reflection. Three related variables were studied including sexual assertiveness, resistance to the double standard, and self-esteem. Participants included 15 individuals who self-selected to participate in the study by completing online surveys. They completed the Female Sexual Subjectivity Inventory, the Hurlbert Index of Sexual Assertiveness, the Double Standard Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, and a demographic questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester-long course. Results indicate that participants experienced significant changes in sexual body-esteem, entitlement to sexual pleasure from self, self-efficacy in achieving sexual pleasure, and sexual self-reflection. No significant changes were found in entitlement to sexual pleasure from partner, sexual assertiveness, resistance to the double standard, or self-esteem. The sample was homogenous in that 100% of participants were emerging adult, female undergraduates who identified as middle to upper middle class. However, the sample was more diverse than the general population of undergraduates in the United States in terms of ethnic, religious, gender, and sexual identity. Due to these characteristics and the small sample size, the results of the study have limited generalizability to the general population but do point to an effective intervention for increasing sexual subjectivity for emerging adult females. Future research should seek to gather data from a larger sample of participants, elucidate the mechanisms by which the course impacted participants' sexual subjectivity, and develop measures that reflect the current diversity of gender and sexual identities in the emerging adult population.

We are interested in the ways in which cultural norms are produced and ways in which sexual double standards operate in producing sexuality and girlsâ subordination. We argue that while adolescents are not simply dupes of cultural norms, they actively invest in and use virginity as a marker of status. Integral to adolescent experience of and ideals around virginity, there is a significant ambivalence where girlsâ virginity is expected, whereas the same is unexpected for young adolescent men. We show that conformity with, rather than resistance to, cultural norms may contradictorily and simultaneously subordinate and empower young women. Choosing to maintain virginity can be seen as an autonomous decision especially when girls position educational aspirations as key to virginity status in order to gain some control over their lives. However, this choice might not simply be about autonomy but occurs in a cultural context where patriarchal values had already made it an obligation. Dominant discourses around virginity and cultural norms stand in direct contradiction to adolescent sexual well-being, albeit with contradictions. Attention to cultural processes through which relations of power are manifest is important in safeguarding young peopleâs sexual health especially in the context of HIV.

They were individually interviewed. The results from the surveys complemented the findings from the qualitative interviews. An analysis of the reliability and validity of the pre-post surveys for this study showed that three different factors (sexual awareness, sexual behavior, and pure love family planning and acceptance) with 11 questions were reliable. A pre-post analysis using a paired t-test showed that after healthy sexuality values program, the sexual awareness index improved from 0.94 (p less than 0.05) to 0.98 (p less than 0.05) and pure love family planning and acceptance index jumped to 0.87 (p less than 0.05), indicating that there were positive effects on those who participated. However, repeated measure analysis of variance showed nearly no changes between male and female students in sexual behavior (F = 0.440, p greater than 0.05). It turned out that female students improved their perception of sexual awareness (F = 11.064, p less than 0.05), and pure love family planning and acceptance students (F = 20.267, p less than 0.05) more than male. In other words, female students established more firm healthy sexuality values through this program. It clearly indicates that healthy sexuality values programs should be expanded for teenagers to firmly establish a healthy view of sexual awareness and behavior. Moreover, the gap between male and female students in pure love family planning and acceptance means that our youths accept double standards that apply to men and women differently.

(2019",Measuring gender norms about relationships in early adolescence: Results from the global early adolescent study.,"Introduction: Gender norms are increasingly recognized as drivers of health and wellbeing. While early adolescence constitutes a critical window of development, there is limited understanding about how adolescents perceive gender relations across different cultural settings. This study used a mixed-method approach, grounded in the voices of young people around the world, to construct and test a cross-cultural scale assessing the perceptions of gender norms regulating romantic relationships between boys and girls in early adolescence. Methods: The study draws on the Global Early Adolescent study (GEAS), a study focusing on gender norms and health related outcomes over the course of adolescence in urban poor settings worldwide. In-depth interviews were first conducted among approximately 200 adolescents between 10â14 years in seven sites across 4 continents to identify common scripts guiding romantic relations in early adolescence. These scripts were then transformed into a multidimensional scale. The scale was tested among 120 adolescents in each of 14 GEAS sites, followed by a second pilot among 75 adolescents in six sites. We evaluated the psychometric criteria of each sub-scale using principal component analysis, and parallel analysis, followed by exploratory factor analysis to guide the selection of a more parsimonious set of items. Results: Results suggested a two-factor structure, consisting of an âadolescent romantic expectationsâ subscale and a âSexual Double Standardâ subscale. Both subscales yielded high internal validity in each site, with polychoric Cronbach alpha values above 0.70 with the exception of Kinshasa for the adolescent romantic expectations scale (0.64) and Hanoi for the sexual double standard scale (0.61). Conclusion: This study reveals common perceptions of gendered norms about romantic engagement in early adolescence, normative for both sexes, but socially valued for boys while devaluated for girls. The findings illustrate that social hierarchies of power in romantic relationships form early in adolescence, regardless of cultural setting. Â© 2018 The Authors",1,159

Quantitative results replicated and extended past research, indicating that sexual and relationship experience increased, attitudes towards dating and sexuality became more gender-stereotyped and permissive, and relationships with parents increased in general closeness.

This study provides a longitudinal analysis of 30 young adults' (17 women, 13 men) sexual experiences, attitudes about sexuality and dating, and reported conversations with parents about sexuality and dating from the 1st and 4th years of college. Self-report questionnaires revealed increases in general closeness with parents, increases in sexual and dating experiences, and more sexually permissive as well as more gender stereotyped attitudes. Qualitative analyses of individual interviews indicated a movement from unilateral and restrictive sex-based topics to more reciprocal and relationship-focused conversations over time. Gender analyses revealed that young women reported more restrictive sex messages and young men more positive sex messages. Participants also described increased openness and comfort in talking about sexual topics with both mothers and fathers from the 1st to 4th year of college. Overall, the results suggest that prior findings of increased mutuality with parents during the college years extend to the traditionally taboo topic of sexuality.

162,"Moyano, N., et al. (2017",Predictors of sexual aggression in adolescents: Gender dominance vs. rape supportive attitudes.,"This study explored the relationship between sexual double standard and rape supportive attitudes in regard to an individual's likelihood to perpetrate sexual aggression. We examined an adolescent sample of 448 boys from Peru, of whom 148 (33.3%) reported to have committed sexual aggression. Sexual contact with an unwilling partner was perpetrated by 24.8% of the total sample, sexual coercion by 14.3%, attempted rape by 12.5%, and finally, rape was perpetrated by 10.3%. In all these types of aggression, the most frequent victim was a dating partner. Compared to non-aggressors, male aggressors reported more sexual double standard and supportive attitudes towards rape. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the most relevant variable in the prediction of sexual aggression was the subject having been a victim of sexual abuse during adolescence and having rape supportive attitudes. Our findings suggest that violent attitudes are more important than the endorsement of non-egalitarian beliefs (sexual double standard) in the perpetration of sexual violence. These findings provide data from Peru, which contribute to the worldwide data on risk factors for sexual aggression in adolescent males. Â© 2016 Colegio Oficial de PsicÃ³logos de Madrid",1,162

The prevalence and correlates of women's token resistance to sex.,"We investigated whether women ever engage in token resistance to sex-saying no but meaning yes-and, if they do, what their reasons are for doing so. A questionnaire administered to 610 undergraduate women asked whether they had ever engaged in token resistance and, if so, asked them to rate the importance of 26 possible reasons. We found that 39.3% of the women had engaged in token resistance at least once. Their reasons fell into three categories: practical, inhibition-related, and manipulative reasons. Women's gender role attitudes, erotophobia-erotophilia, and other attitudes and beliefs varied as a function of their experience with token resistance and their sexual experience. We argue that, given society's sexual double standard, token resistance may be a rational behavior. It could, however, have negative consequences, including discouraging honest communication, perpetuating restrictive gender stereotypes, and-if men learn to disregard women's refusals-increasing the incidence of rape.

Both women and men are prejudiced towards sexually-accessible women, but only women inflict costly punishment.","Across human societies, female sexuality is suppressed by gendered double standards, slut shaming, sexist rape laws, and honour killings. The question of what motivates societies to punish promiscuous women, however, has been contested. Although some have argued that men suppress female sexuality to increase paternity certainty, others maintain that this is an example of intrasexual competition. Here we show that both sexes are averse to overt displays of female sexuality, but that motivation is sex-specific. In all studies, participants played an economic game with a female partner whose photograph either signalled that she was sexually-accessible or sexually-restricted. In study 1, we found that men and women are less altruistic in a Dictator Game (DG) when partnered with a woman signalling sexual-accessibility. Both sexes were less trusting of sexually-accessible women in a Trust Game (TG) (study 2); women (but not men), however, inflicted costly punishment on a sexually-accessible woman in an Ultimatum Game (UG) (study 3).

Variables included virginity, religiosity, relationship to parents, relationship to last sex partner, sex philosophy, attractiveness, drug use, contraceptives used, fear of AIDS and effect of this fear on behavior. Results indicated a 91% nonvirginity rate for men, 76% for women. Both genders initiated sex at the same age. Men exhibited a more liberal sexual philosophy. Neither gender had a sexual double standard. Women's attractiveness, but not men's, related to nonvirginity. Relationship with parents was not associated with virginity, but religiosity was. Drug use was related to nonvirginity. Frequent drug users had less commitment to last sex partner than did infrequent users. Nondisease-protective contraceptive methods decreased. Despite fear of AIDS, only one-third of the students practiced ""safe sex"" consistently, and men were less concerned with practicing it than women. Commitment has not increased since the 1986 survey. The premarital sexual beliefs and behaviors of a sample of 98 male and 148 female undergraduates at a small liberal arts college in northeastern US were investigated in a 1991 survey. Comparable surveys had been administered at the same college in 1974, 1979, and 1986. The proportion of male students who were no longer virgins was 82.6% in 1974, 91.0% in 1979, 78.4% in 1986, and 90.8% in 1991; among female students, these statistics were 74.8%, 88.4%, 75.3%, and 75.7%, respectively. Self-reported religiosity was significantly and positively associated with male and female virginity. The majority of students embraced a personal philosophy that condoned premarital sex as long as it took place in the context of a meaningful relationship. Frequent use of drugs and/or alcohol was positive correlated with a high number of sexual partners, independent of age. Never-use of contraception was reported by 5.3% of sexually active students in 1991 compared to 7.2% in 1986. The contraceptive methods most frequently reported in the 1991 survey included condoms (59.2%), pill (42.1%), withdrawal (21.7%), rhythm (6.3%), and sponge (5.8%). The number of students who used condoms at least 50% of the time was significantly higher in 1991 than in 1986. Only 35% of students reported use of condoms at all times. 10.9% of students indicated that fear of contracting a disease prevents them from engaging in intercourse. 43% of female and 32% of male students stated they had deliberately reduced their number of sexual partners due to a fear of human immunodeficiency virus. In general, survey findings suggested that female students were more concerned than their male counterparts about the quality of their relationships and the need for safe sex, but were unable to exert a significant effect on the male partner's sexual practices, presumably because of their lack of assertiveness.",1,166

(2013",Subverting the sexual double standard: How exposure to and identification with characters in televised counter sexual scripts affect young women's sexual well-being.,"Television is a major source of sexual scripts for adolescents and young adults. This dissertation examined how exposure to and identification with characters in sexual scripts that either reinforce or subvert a heterosexual script affect young adult female viewers' agreement with the sexual double standard (i.e., different ""rules"" of appropriate sexual behavior for males and females) and their sexual self-concepts (i.e., how they view themselves as sexual beings). An experiment with a 3 (script: dominant heterosexual script, equal desire counter script, or equal love counter script) X 2 (manipulation: character identification or no identification), plus control group, between-subjects factorial design was conducted. One hundred and sixty-two female undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 23 (M =20.41) completed an online pre-test questionnaire about one week before exposure. After exposure in the laboratory to a randomly-assigned sexual script or control video that did not include any sexual scripts, participants completed an immediate post-test questionnaire. The identification manipulation was unsuccessful and therefore all participants were examined by their level of identification as measured in the post-test questionnaire. Main findings include exposure to the equal desire counter script increased participants' sexual optimism, belief that their future sex lives will be positive and rewarding. Exposure to the equal desire counter script also increased the sexual self-efficacy of participants who had engaged in casual sex and the sexual esteem of participants who had engaged in sex. Exposure to any of the sexual scripts increased participants' agreement with the sexual double standard the more they identified with the male character than with the female. Results indicate that exposure to counter sexual scripts that highlight gender equality between sexual partners may influence young female viewers positively by strengthening their sexual self-concepts, especially for participants with previous sexual experience. Viewing sexual scripts from a male character's perspective, however, can negatively influence female viewers by reinforcing agreement with sexual stereotypes. Given that identification with different characters affected the outcomes of viewing sexual scripts, health communicators should pay close attention to the role that identification plays in persuasive and narrative communication.

The present study was conducted to examine how perceptions about pornography may play a role in the relationship between pornography use and sex-role attitudes. Perceived general acceptance and perceived influence of pornography on most people partially mediated the relationship between pornography use and sex-role attitudes. The more participants reported using pornography, the more they believed pornography was generally accepted and had a positive influence; however, conversely to what was hypothesized, the more positive they perceived pornographyâs influence, the less likely they were to report sex-role attitudes that endorse a sexual double standard.

Further, participants in this study did not demonstrate accordance with gender sexuality stereotypes in which sex-typed females are seen as more passive sexually, by self-reporting as having a perceived lower or equal sex drive than their peers, and sex-typed males are seen as more aggressive sexually, as seen by self-report as having a higher sex drive than their peers.

Confirmatory factor analyses with data from this sample suggested acceptable fit for the posited 9-factor structure.

The factors were: personal sexual code, dogmatism, dualism, religiosity, alcohol information, alcohol consumption and sex, alcoholism, parental drinking behavior, and conservatism. An analysis of the results showed that men and women differed on three factors (personal sexual code, dogmatism, and alcohol information). While women were less likely than men to be dualistic or dogmatic in their approach to religion, sex, or alcohol, they were also more likely to support a double standard, feeling that sexual intimacy for women should be based on love, but accepting that men base sex on mutual attraction. Additionally, women did not see a link between sexual satisfaction and alcohol consumption as men did. Women also were less likely to feel that virginity is strange or that homosexuals need help. These results suggest that men may feel different pressures to adjust to their sexuality. Thus, programming which is unique to the problems and adjustment of each sex may be more beneficial.

Methods: Data were collected through structured and confidential individual interviews with 100 adolescents, selected randomly from among 1467 students attending one French high school.

Sexual permissiveness of peers is associated with a higher frequency of sexual practices considered risky. The attitudes of peers with regard to contraception are associated with protective contraceptive attitudes, without a direct influence on behavioural patterns.

180,"Purvis, J. L. (2018",Strategic interference and tinder use: A mixed-method exploration of romantic interactions in contemporary contexts.,"Research has suggested that men and women have different orientations towards mating strategies (Buss & Schmitt, 1993), with men more likely than women to orient towards shortterm mating strategies (Hyde, 2005). This dissimilarity may cause men and women to have different goals in romantic situations. Strategic interference refers to the conflict that arises when two sexes encounter these different goals within romantic or sexual contexts (Buss, 1989). Men and women often solve strategic interference through sex-linked forms of deception, with the goal to increase reproductive fitness (Buss, 1989). This means that men and women sometimes deceive potential partners about their sexual goals in ways that they believe will appeal to the sex to which their romantic partner belongs. The following three studies explored whether these gender differences and encounters with strategic interference are still prevalent in the age of new dating technologies. Study one investigated whether users of the online dating app Tinder are more likely to encounter deception around sex-linked forms of strategic interference than are online dating website users or those who date offline, and it also examined whether these experiences vary between men and women. Study one also analyzed whether gender, sexual double standards, and strategic interference predicted romantic and sexual satisfaction with a specifically recalled romantic interaction. Study two explored how Tinder use primes gendertypical mate preferences and mating orientation. Finally, study three analyzed Internet forum posts on a Tinder-themed website to develop a qualitative picture of the real-world experiences of Tinder users.

The difference between the ""old"" and the ""new"" double standard is that each sex imposes it on the other.

Consistent with MCT, men were more likely than women to endorse the SDS and to give sexual advice in ways that reinforce it-gender differences that were mediated by hostile sexism (HS) and endorsing the SDS, respectively. The data did not support FCT's argument that women are motivated by sexual economics to restrict female sexuality (Baumeister & Twenge, 2002). Both genders discouraged women from having casual sex to protect women from social stigma and rape myths that justify violence against sexual women. In concert, the findings support MCT more than FCT and suggest that sexism, stigma, and rape myths are primary obstacles to sexual equality.

Alternatively, people generally perceive casual sex as riskier for women, who may be discouraged from sex to protect them from stigma and danger (Rudman et al. 2013). If so, manipulating perceived risk to reduce or reverse the costs of casual sex for men and for women should eliminate or reverse the SADS, respectively. Results investigating American adults (NÂ =Â 180) supported risk assessmentâs explanatory power. When costs to both partners were mild, the SADS was eliminated, but when costs to men were higher, women were urged to have casual sex more than men were. The SADS emerged only when costs to women were higher. The findings have implications for gender equality and sexuality theories, but also practitioners (e.g., therapists, sex educators, and physicians). The SADS is far from intractable, but believing in rigid sexual double standards creates psychological conflict in women caught between motives to be seen as moral and sexually desirable, which negatively impacts their sexual health (e.g., Katz and Farrow 2000).

The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) is a measure that may provide a means to examine the double standard without the contamination of the demand characteristics and social desirability biases that plague self-report research (Marks & Fraley, 2005). The purpose of this study was to examine the factors influencing explicit and implicit double standards, and to examine the relationship between these explicit and implicit double standards, and levels of socially desirable responding. One hundred and three university students completed a sexual double standard IAT, an explicit measure of the double standard, and measures of socially desirable responding. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that levels of socially desirable responding were not related to implicit or explicit double standards. Men endorsed a stronger explicit traditional double standard than women, whereas for implicit sexual standards, men demonstrated a relatively gender-neutral evaluation and women demonstrated a strong reverse double standard. These results suggest the existence of a complex double standard, and indicate that more research of sexual attitudes should include implicit measures.

(2012",The role of mass media related risk factors in predicting sexually risky intentions and behaviors among adolescents: A model of sexual risk taking.,"Although a number of studies have demonstrated the effects of mass media on various behaviors the systematic process of examining media related risk factors in sexual health behavior models has not been fully explored. This study offers a rationale, and several propositions and hypotheses for a more inclusive model of sexual risk taking integrating two mass media-related variables with five traditional health risks factors that appear in the current literature. The study also explores gender differences among the proposed relationships in the model. The study tests the proposed integrated model using a secondary analysis via structural equation statistical methods applied to the Teen Media and Health Survey data. The final model supported relationships that were hypothesized based on a rationale linking several mass communication and health-related behavior theories. Findings from this study suggest that sexual intentions that are risky are strong predictor of self-reported sexual behaviors that are risky. In addition, permissive attitudes regarding sex, perceptions of peer norms that are risky, and sexual self efficacy also predict sexual intentions that are risky. This results from the study futher support the utility of impulsive decision making and sensation seeking when predicting sexual risks. The current model and study results indicate that overall exposure to mass media was a significant antecedent of adolescents' perceptions that media messages encourage sexual behaviors. Perceptions that media messages encourage sexual behaviors is also succesfully used to predict adolescent's permissive attitudes regarding sex, their perceptions of peer norms that are risky, and the adolsecents' perceptions of sexual self efficacy. The overall model is also tested in separate male/female models to examine the potential generality of the model across gender subgroups. The results indicate more similarities than differences in sexual risk taking among males and females. One notable difference is the path from mass media exposure to perceptions that media messages encourage sexual behaviors, which is appreciably stronger among females than among males. Another notable difference is that the pathway from sexual intentions that are risky to sexual behaviors that are risky, which again is stronger among females than among males. There are several implications for interventions that arise from this study. Media exposure and perceptions of sexuality through media play an important role in adolescents' attitudes, norms and perceptions of self efficacy. Parents, educators, health practitioners should discuss with adolescents the content of popular mass media, along with the ways that the popular media influence young audiences. Parents, teachers and health practitioners need to pay particular attention to creating messages that can combat the information that adolescent receive from mass media about sex and sexual behaviors. The most important implication may be that adults in U.S. society should take children's exposure to media seriously, pay attention to what their children are viewing and to become active in their communities advocating for more socially responsible media. A concerted effort can be made to reduce sexual innuendos, images and portrayals in the media. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,196

A combined mate-selection questionnaire and experimental paradigm was used to examine more systematically men's and women's (N = 436) desires for different levels of sexual experience in a potential partner. When rating either a casual dating or a marital partner, participants gave higher desirability ratings to chastity than to either moderate or extensive sexual experience; furthermore, moderate sexual experience was perceived as more desirable than extensive sexual experience. Contrary to predictions, no gender differences in desirability ratings were found for the various levels of sexual experience. The authors also examined how sociosexual orientation (i.e., degree of sexual permissiveness; see J. A. Simpson and S. W. Gangestad, 1991a) might be related to desirability ratings for sexual (in)experience in a partner within each gender. Unrestricted (i.e., permissive) women gave higher desirability ratings than did restricted women to moderate and considerable levels of sexual experience, whereas restricted women gave higher desirability ratings to chastity than did unrestricted women.

We investigated gender, ethnicity, and cohort differences in sexual permissiveness, endorsement of the double standard, and socio-sexuality. Compared to women, men had more permissive attitudes, particularly about sex in casual relationships, endorsed the double standard to a greater degree, and had a more unrestricted socio-sexuality. Black men were generally more permissive than White, Hispanic, and Asian men, whereas ethnic differences were not found among women. Participants from the 1995-1999 cohort were slightly less permissive than those from the 1990-1994 and 2005-2012 cohorts. Although prior meta-analytic studies (e.g., Petersen & Hyde, 2010) found reduced gender differences in sexuality over time, our cohort analyses suggest that gender differences in sexual permissiveness have not changed over the past two decades among college students.

In this article the author drew on two studies of college students to analyze peer culture and the organization of gender and sexuality within a college party scene. Within this scene, fraternity men's masculine identities and peer status were linked to their ability to hook up with women. However, strong sexual double standards stigmatized many sexually active women, reducing their appeal as sexual partners. In contrast, men saw first-year women were seen as ""fresh,"" ""clean,"" and especially alluring.

(2018",Exploring Heterosexual Adults’ Endorsement of the Sexual Double Standard among Initiators of Consensually Nonmonogamous Relationship Behaviors.,"Although the traditional sexual double standard (SDS) has been well documented, recent research has produced inconsistencies. Some scholars argue that the SDS may only exist for less traditional sexual behaviors, reflecting societyâs progression toward equality. Thus, the current study examined the SDS when evaluating individuals initiating a variety of forms of consensual nonmonogamy (CNM; i.e., romantic relationships that are sexually and/or emotionally nonexclusive). Using a between-subject experimental paradigm, 793 heterosexual U.S. adults (338 men, 455 women) read one of eight vignettes depicting an individual initiating one of five behaviors with their romantic partner (polyamory, swinging, open relationships, group sex, role-playing) and subsequently judged the initiator using three judgments of interest (cognitive abilities, morality, and relationship satisfaction). The results indicated that women initiators were judged more favorably than were men initiators and that role-playing initiators were judged more favorably than were CNM initiators. Among CNM behaviors, those initiating swinging and group sex were judged more favorably than were those initiating polyamory and open relationships. These results are consistent with research highlighting inconsistencies in the SDS in contemporary society and demonstrate the endorsement of a relationship double standard. Implications regarding gender equality as well as the promotion of inclusive sexual education are discussed. Â© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",1,223
224,"To, S. M. and S. M. I. Kan (2014",,"Although scholars from different disciplines have begun to study the prevalence, factors, and impact of adolescents' exposure to sexually explicit online materials (SEOM), few studies have taken cultural and gender factors into consideration. This chapter reports the results of a study on the gender differences in the patterns and psychosocial correlates of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents' in accessing SEOM. To test the hypothesis that gender variations are clear in the comparisons of the patterns for viewing SEOM and sexual attitudes among Chinese adolescents, a cross-sectional survey with two different sets of questionnaires was conducted that targeted five co-educational high schools in Hong Kong and recruited a total of 1,016 students as respondents. The results indicate marked differences between adolescent male and female viewers of SEOM in terms of their acceptance of gender equality, body-centered sexuality, sexual coercion in sexual relationships, and premarital sexual permissiveness, as well as agreement with restrictions associated with SEOM and the perceived harmfulness of SEOM. However, such differences were also found between adolescent males and females who were not exposed to SEOM. Furthermore, male SEOM viewers were found to have a lower level of acceptance of gender equality, agreement with restrictions associated with SEOM, and the perceived harmfulness of SEOM than non-viewers, while female SEOM viewers were found to have a higher level of acceptance of sexual coercion and premarital sex than non-viewers. The results also support the premise of the study that adolescents' intrapersonal reactions to SEOM partially mediate and amplify their relationship between gender and their sexual attitudes and attitudes toward SEOM. The findings of the present study suggest that in addition to the impact of adolescents' exposure to SEOM, the socialization of gender roles in Chinese culture might account for the causes of gender variations in Hong Kong Chinese adolescents' sexual attitudes and attitudes toward SEOM. While women are often constructed as inferior subjects that should fulfill men's sexual needs in SEOM, both SEOM exposure and gender stereotypes in Chinese cultural beliefs may exert substantial influences on Chinese adolescent sexual development. This study provides evidence for the design and provision of culturally sensitive and gender-sensitive sex education for Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. The core of sex education has to meet both male and female students' needs for information, knowledge, and skills relating to specific situations of personal, interpersonal, community, gender, and cultural aspects. Internet-driven sex education should also be developed to mobilize interactions and positive mutual learning among adolescents in today's digital world. Through these outlets adolescents will be able to expand their horizons and be free from the rigidity found in traditional cultural and gender biases relating to sexuality.

(2012","Direct and mediating effects of accessing sexually explicit online materials on Hong Kong adolescents' attitude, knowledge, and behavior relating to sex.","This study investigated the impact of accessing sexually explicit online materials (SEOM) on Hong Kong adolescents' attitude, knowledge, and behavior relating to sex. Challenging the assumption of a direct relationship between the frequency of accessing SEOM and its influence on adolescent sexuality, the basic premise of the study is that exposure to SEOM elicits adolescents' intrapersonal reactions with mediating effects on their sexual development. To test this, the study employed a survey design with data based on a sample of 503 adolescents in Hong Kong. Analyses of covariance and mediation were conducted to test the hypotheses derived from the conceptual framework. The results indicated that adolescents' frequency of accessing and reactions to SEOM were positively linked to their acceptance of stereotyped gender roles and power imbalance in sexual relationships, permissiveness of premarital sex, sexual compulsion, and sexual daydreaming. Furthermore, the results supported the premise of the study that adolescents' reactions to SEOM mediate and amplify the effects of the frequency of accessing SEOM. The study provides a frame of reference for youth workers generating an in-depth analysis of adolescents' experience of SEOM exposure, thus broadening the conceptualization of the needs and problems faced by adolescents while expanding potential areas of intervention, prevention, and education.

227,"Tubre, K. R. (2008",Adolescent sexual attitudes and behavior: How important is parent communication and involvement?,"The present study explored the relationship between parental influence and adolescent sexual attitudes and behavior by looking at family process variables (parentadolescent communication, parental attitudes about sex, and parental monitoring), and demographic variables (race, age, and gender). Participants consisted of 732 adolescents from Virginia who participated in a Virginia Department of Health (VDH) funded abstinence-based pregnancy prevention program in 1999 and 2000. All participants reported living in two-parent homes with both biological parents. The current study was a secondary analysis of an existing dataset. It was hypothesized that better quality parent-adolescent communication, more conservative paternal attitudes about sex, and stricter parental rule setting (i.e., monitoring) would predict more conservative adolescent sexual attitudes and less adolescent sexual behavior. In addition, the best predictors of adolescent sexual attitudes and behavior were identified. Results revealed that all parent variables predicted adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, better quality parent-adolescent communication predicted more conservative adolescent sexual attitudes. In regards to parent communication and adolescent sexual behaviors, only mother-adolescent communication predicted sexual behavior, such that adolescents who reported having more in common with their mothers reported less sexual activity. In terms of the predictive ability of parent attitudes, both mother and father attitudes predicted adolescent attitudes and behavior, such that more conservative maternal and paternal attitudes about sex predicted more conservative sexual attitudes in adolescents. In regards to parent attitudes and adolescent sexual behavior, both permissive and conservative parental attitudes predicted more adolescent sexual activity. Stricter rules about recreational activities and dating, and receiving consistent discipline predicted more conservative adolescent sexual attitudes. In regards to sexual behavior, stricter rules about dating and more consistent discipline were predictive of more sexual activity. The best overall predictor of adolescent sexual attitudes and behavior was father's approval of premarital sex (father's sexual attitudes). Father's approval of premarital sex predicted more conservative adolescent sexual attitudes and less sexual activity. Although this result is contrary to what might be expected, the sample included only twoparent families in which the biological father was present in the home. It may be that the presence of a father in the home is a protective factor against adolescent sexual activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,227
228,"Tupa, D. J.

Participants were 152 female and 115 male undergraduates, and 137 mothers and 101 fathers of the students. Participants completed questionnaires about their family sex communication, sexual attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, McMaster Family Assessment Device, and open-ended questions about the process of family sex communication and messages parents conveyed regarding sex. Results indicated gender differences with daughters having better communication than sons with mothers, and sons having better communication than daughters with fathers. Daughters and fathers had particularly poor communication. There were also generational differences; parent rating communication higher than children. General family communication was a significant predictor of communication about sex based on child and parent ratings. Affective Responsiveness (the expression of appropriate affect by family members over a range of situations) was a significant predictor for children. The communication about sex that parents had with their own parents was a significant predictor of the communication with their children. Behavior Control (the maintenance of standards of behavior) was a significant predictor for mothers. Roles (established patterns of behavior for handling family needs) was a significant predictor for fathers. There was limited evidence for an effect of parents on the sexual knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of children, with mothers having a greater effect than fathers. Factors that facilitated or impeded discussions about sex were related to the general parent-child relationship, comfort with the topic, and gender. Messages about sex pertained to when sex is appropriate, responsible sexual behavior, potential negative consequences of sex, and general positive and negative messages about sex. Issues related to gender were pervasive and the results were discussed in relation to gender roles and the sexual double standard. Limitations of the study and directions for future research were also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,228

The reliability was analysed and the cross-validation method was applied with exploratory factorial analysis and confirmatory factorial analysis to check the structure of the scale. A differential item analysis was performed according to sex. Finally, correlations were made with ambivalent sexism and distorted beliefs about women and violence, and a contrast of means was performed by sex and age groups using variance analysis and effect sizes. The results were: (a) good internal consistency; (b) a one-dimensional structure with seven items; (c) just one item presents a differential functioning; (d) a positive, significant relationship between the sexual double standard, ambivalent sexism and sexist beliefs; (e) boys and younger adolescents showed a greater adherence to the double standard; and (f) social desirability affects the responses of girls, especially younger ones.

Participants were 16â21-year-old same-sex friendship dyads (31 male and 30 female dyads) who performed a peer interaction task that consisted of five discussion assignments focusing on party planning, sexual double standards, condom use, homosexuality, and consensual sex. Videotaped discussions were coded to capture the amounts of normative talk (e.g., consistent with notions of healthy sexuality) and deviant talk (e.g., consistent with notions of risky sexuality), and the verbal or nonverbal reinforcement thereof. Participants also completed individual questionnaires to assess their perceived sexual descriptive norms, injunctive norms, pressure, and risk norms among their peers. Actorâpartner interdependence model (APIM) results revealed that youthsâ perceived descriptive, injunctive, and risk norms, but not their experienced peer pressure, were related to both their own (actor effects) and their friendsâ (partner effects) normativity and deviance. Overall, more deviance was related to perceiving friends to be more sexually active, more approving of having sex, and engaging in more risky sex, whereas more normativity was related to these perceptions in the opposite direction. Gender differences in the APIMs indicated that interactive normativity and deviance was related to perceived descriptive, injunctive, and risk norms for boys, but only to perceived injunctive norms for girls. These findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the dyadic nature of youthsâ sexual communication with friends, their relation to individual sexual peer norm perceptions, and gender differences therein.

Not when it comes to sexual permissiveness.,"Prior research finds that sexually permissive individuals are judged more negatively than nonpermissive peers, placing them at risk of social isolation. Based on the positive assortment principle (i.e., preferences for similarity in attributes in close relationships), we examined whether participants' own permissiveness mitigated negative judgments of permissive others in the same-sex friendship context. College students (N = 751) evaluated a hypothetical same-sex target with either 2 (nonpermissive) or 20 (permissive) past sex partners on 10 friendship-relevant outcomes. Participant permissiveness attenuated some negative evaluations. However, preferences were rarely reversed, and no moderation was found in five outcomes, suggesting the role of permissiveness-based positive assortment is limited, and evolutionary concerns may take precedence.

232,"Walfield, S. M. (2018",“Men Cannot Be Raped”: Correlates of Male Rape Myth Acceptance.,"Despite the increased attention surrounding rape and sexual assault, research on male victims remains limited, particularly concerning the adherence to rape myths. Rape myths, which are false beliefs that are widely accepted, contribute to the justification and normalization of sexual violence by offenders and focus on the actions and behavior of victims while minimizing the harm. Addressing the gaps in the research, the present study examines how demographics, personal experiences with rape (i.e., being or knowing a survivor), and belief systems relate to rape myth adherence for male victims. The sample consisted of 1,220 adults in the United States who completed an online survey via Amazonâs Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The number of myths endorsed ranged from 0 to 21 with a mean of 4.1 (SD = 4.7). In the final model of the hierarchical regression, results indicate rape myth acceptance was positively associated with individuals who were male, older, and more likely to believe males falsely report rapes to law enforcement at a high rate. Of the gender and sexuality attitudinal scales, individuals who adhered to female rape myths, held negative attitudes toward homosexuals, accepted traditional sexual double standards, and believed in traditional social gender roles were more likely to adhere to male rape myths. Findings demonstrate that rape myths operate similarly for male and female victims. Sexual assault programming and interventions need to address that males can be victims of sexual violence and the myths associated with male victimization in addition to generally challenging the adverse belief systems that serve as the foundation for rape myths generally.

For instance, is there a sexual double standard whereby women are judged more negatively than men? In the present study, 404 university students read one of four randomly assigned scenarios describing an FWBR (scenarios varied on character gender and FWBR experience) and then completed measures of their judgment of the main character, their predictions about the relationship depicted, their beliefs about whether the character should keep the relationship secret, and their perception of how the character would be judged by peers. Two respondent-level variables (respondent gender; respondent FWBR experience) were also examined as predictors. Half of the participants (52.5%) had themselves experienced an FWBR, with a majority evaluating these experiences positively. Male respondents rated scenario characters more positively and made more positive relationship predictions than did female respondents. Respondents who had personal experience of their own FWBR rated characters more positively and made more positive relationship predictions than those who had never experienced an FWBR. There was no evidence of a sexual double standard in character judgments. However, relationship predictions and estimates of others' judgments were more negative when the character was female and there was a greater perceived need for secrecy. Thus, the current research did not support the existence of a sexual double standard for FWBRs, but may have suggested the perception of one.

(2016",Gender's role in misperceptions of peers' sexual motives.,"The sexual double standard influences men's and women's sexual attitudes and behavior, leading men and women to consider distinct sexual motives, or reasons whether or not to engage in sexual intercourse. The goal of the present paper was to document how the sexual double standard shapes perceptions of peers' sexual motives. We build on past research by using open-ended questions and measuring perceptions of both same-gender and other-gender peers. The sample included 154 heterosexual college students (50 % female, 49 % European American, 25 % Latino American, 26 % African American) recruited via probability sampling. When we compared perceptions of men's and women's sexual motives, we found that participants seemed to rely on the sexual double standard. Participants were more likely to attribute a female-stereotyped motive (e.g., romantic relationship characteristics, feeling ""ready"", emotional investment) and less likely to attribute a male-stereotyped motive (""easy"", arousal, physical appearance) to female peers than to male peers. However, when we compared participants' own motives to perceptions of their peers' motives, participants overestimated male-stereotyped motives and underestimated female-stereotyped motives in peers, regardless of peer gender, possibly in congruence with stereotypes of hookup culture. These findings demonstrate that, although individuals sometimes rely on the sexual double standard to attribute sexual motives to others, misperceptions of peers' sexual motives may also be influenced by stereotypes of hookup culture. These misperceptions contribute to pluralistic ignorance that may influence college students' sexual behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",1,237

Second, we aimed to determine the extent to which these associations were comparable for men and women. Although we expected mean differences on many of these constructs (e.g., men perceiving more peer approval), we expected the relationships between these constructs to be comparable for women and men.

METHODS: Adolescents (N = 173) completed questionnaires that included 1 of 6 randomly assigned vignettes that described male and female peer models 3 ways: (1) no information about model's sexual behavior, (2) model in love but choosing abstinence, and (3) model in love and having sex. Participants read the vignette to which they had been assigned and responded to statements about the peer model. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Results did not show evidence of a sexual double standard among male participants, but did show some evidence of a sexual double standard among female participants. Additionally, both male and female participants evaluated more harshly peer models that were having sex than peer models that chose abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide insight concerning the lack of a sexual double standard among male participants, the existence, to some degree, of a sexual double standard among female participants, and demonstrate the existence of a social cost to both young men and young women for choosing to have sex.

This study explores the nature of public perceptions of a group of offenders on which the media often focusâfemale teachers who assault adolescent male studentsâby examining reader comments posted on five Huffington Post articles published from November 2010 to November 2013. Using a thematic coding methodology to analyze over 900 online comments, we found that most comments recognize a current double standard in the sentencing process for female teacher sex offenders compared to their male counterparts. Comments also rely on traditional sexual scripts and/or gender role expectations to either acknowledge or deny a victimâs presence. Contrary to existing research that examined public perceptions and found that more punitive attitudes were expressed toward male sex offenders, these results suggest that the public believes in equality in sentencing for all sex offenders, regardless of gender. These results also confirm prior studies that find that the public perceives adolescent male victims of rape by older women âlucky.â. Â© 2016, Â© The Author(s) 2016.",1,240
241,"Zaikman, Y. (2018",The impact of the sexual double standard on perceptions of sexual assault.,"In the United States, sexual assault is a pervasive issue that affects many women. There are various factors that can influence people's perceptions of sexual assault. Given that perceptions of sexual assault can be influenced by traditional gender roles, the social phenomenon known as the sexual double standard can be influential on such perceptions. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine whether endorsement of the SDS, as well as individual sexual histories of the female victim and the male perpetrator can influence people's a) perceptions of sexual consent, b) encouragement to report the sexual assault, and c) attributions of blame, damage, and verdict and sentencing recommendations. The experiment employed a 2 (participant gender) x 2 (victim's sexual history) x 2 (perpetrator's sexual history) x 2 (boss gender) between subjects design. Five hundred ninety-two participants read a short vignette describing an ambiguous sexual encounter between Lisa (victim) and Kevin (perpetrator). Participants completed several measures assessing their evaluations of Lisa and Kevin, perceptions of sexual consent, recommendations to report the assault and attributions of guilt, blame and damage. Participants also recommended verdict and sentencing length for Kevin. Results illustrate that people's endorsement of the SDS is predictive of their perceptions of sexual assault, in particular when those individuals read about Lisa and Kevin having promiscuous sexual histories. Moreover, it appears that female participants were also less likely to perceived wrong doing when Lisa had a promiscuous sexual history. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed, including suggestions for sexual consent awareness programs, sexual assault information brochures, and the legal system as it relates to cases of sexual assault.

242,"Zaikman, Y. and M. J. Marks (2014",Ambivalent sexism and the sexual double standard.,"The sexual double standard is the notion that women are evaluated negatively and men positively for engaging in similar sexual behaviors. Because traditional, gender-based stereotypes are reflected in the attitudes that people hold towards men and women, it is likely that sexism plays a part in the manifestation of the double standard. The goal of the present study is to investigate the relationship between sexism (prejudice against individuals based on their gender) and the sexual double standard. There are two types of sexism: hostile (negative prejudice) and benevolent (positive prejudice). We hypothesized that participants displaying high levels of either type of sexism would be most likely to exhibit the sexual double standard. A US-sample of 232 undergraduates from a Southwestern university completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) and the Ambivalence Towards Men Inventory (AMI) and then evaluated a hypothetical target individual who reported having zero, one or 12 sexual partners. Results show that participants' sexist attitudes towards men and women were related to their exhibition of the sexual double standard. Specifically, men and women's hostile attitudes towards targets of their own gender were related to negative evaluations of highly sexually active targets of the same gender, while men and women's benevolent attitudes towards the opposite gender were related to positive evaluation of highly sexually active targets of the opposite gender.

Marks (2016",The influence of physical appearance and personality on the exhibition of the sexual double standard.,"The sexual double standard is the phenomenon whereby men are evaluated positively and women are evaluated negatively for engaging in identical sexual behavior. Although people can hold conflicting information (e.g., stereotypical vs. counterstereotypical individuating information) about other individuals, they attempt to form a consistent impression of individuals by inhibiting inconsistent information. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether individuating information about physical appearance and personality could mitigate the exhibition of the evaluations stereotypically associated with the sexual double standard. A sample of 596 participants evaluated a target person who reported having 1 or 12 sexual partners. Overall, participants evaluated highly sexually active female targets more positively than their male counterparts when the targets were either attractive and had a pleasant personality, or were unattractive and had an unpleasant personality. Results highlight the importance of the consistency of individuating information for evaluations of highly sexually active women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",1,243

According to social role theory, the SDS exists due to gender role structures. Consequently, perceived violations of women's sexual behavior are associated with the SDS. In addition to gender role violations of sexual behavior, two additional violations of gender roles exist: heterosexual sexual orientation norms and gender role characteristics. The current study aims to investigate whether the SDS persists for sexual orientation-violating and gender role characteristic-violating targets, and to examine which of the three gender role violations influence evaluations of others' sexual behavior. A U.S. sample of 483 participants evaluated target individuals who were either female or male, heterosexual/gay man or lesbian, feminine or masculine, and had 1 or 12 sexual partners. Results indicate that SDS persists for gender role-violating targets but is exhibited differently for targets violating heterosexual sexual orientation norms and gender role characteristics.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential relationship between life history theory, attachment theory and the sexual double standard. Life history theory posits that one's upbringing (e.g., quality of early relationship with one's parents) may have implications for one's future mating strategies, especially for women. Furthermore, adult attachment orientation often influences individuals' feelings toward sexual behavior. To address the relationship between these variables, we had participants complete questionnaires regarding their early relationships with their parents and their current attachment regarding romantic partners. Participants then evaluated a target individual who reported having 1 or 12 sexual partners (N = 154). Results showed that female participants' early relationships with their parents and their current attachment avoidance predicted their exhibition of the double standard. Results are discussed in the context of theoretical and empirical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",1,245

247,"Zuo, X., et al. (2012",Gender differences in adolescent premarital sexual permissiveness in three Asian cities: Effects of gender-role attitudes.,"Purpose: Gender is an important factor in understanding premarital sexual attitudes and behaviors. Many studies indicate that males are more likely to initiate sexual intercourse and have more permissive perceptions about sex than females. Yet few studies have explored possible reasons for these gender differences. With samples of unmarried adolescents in three Asian cities influenced by Confucian cultures, this article investigates the relationship between underlying gender norms and these differences in adolescents' premarital sexual permissiveness (PSP). Methods: In a collaborative survey conducted in 2006-2007 in urban and rural areas of Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei, 16,554 unmarried participants aged 15-24 years were recruited in the three-City Asian Study of Adolescents and Youth, with 6,204, 6,023, and 4,327 respondents from each city, respectively. All the adolescents were administered face-to-face interviews, coupled with computer-assisted self-interview for sensitive questions. Scales on gender-role attitudes and on PSP for both male and female respondents were developed and applied to our analysis of the data. Multilinear regression was used to analyze the relationship between gender-role attitudes and sexual permissiveness. Results: Male respondents in each city held more permissive attitudes toward premarital sex than did females, with both boys and girls expressing greater permissiveness to male premarital sexual behaviors. Boys also expressed more traditional attitudes to gender roles (condoning greater inequality) than did girls in each city. Adolescents' gender-role attitudes and permissiveness to premarital sex varied considerably across the three cities, with the Vietnamese the most traditional, the Taiwanese the least traditional, and the adolescents in Shanghai in the middle. A negative association between traditional gender roles and PSP was only found among girls in Shanghai and Taipei. In Shanghai, female respondents who held more traditional gender-role attitudes were more likely to exercise a double standard with respect to male as opposed to female premarital sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18). This relationship also applied to attitudes of both girls and boys in Taipei (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.22, respectively). Conclusions: Although with variation across sites, gender differences in PSP and attitudes to gender roles among adolescents were very significant in each of the three Asian cities influenced by Confucian-based values. Traditional gender norms may still be deeply rooted in the three cities, especially among females; while it is important to advocate gender equity in adolescent reproductive health programs, the pathway of traditional gender norms in influencing adolescent reproductive health outcomes must be understood, as must differences and similarities across regions.

Reality Dating Television Programs, Attitudes Toward Sex, and Sexual Behaviors.","Past research has revealed associations between television viewing and sexual attitudes and behaviors. We examined a burgeoning new television genre, reality dating programs (RDPs). Undergraduate students (ages 18-24) reported their overall television viewing, their RDP viewing, and their involvement with RDPs (watching in order to learn and watching in order to be entertained). They also completed measures of attitudes toward sex, dating, and relationships, and answered questions about sexual behavior. Most participants were occasional or frequent viewers of at least one RDP. Men reported using RDPs for learning more than did women; there was no gender difference in use of RDPs for entertainment. Total amount of RDP viewing was positively correlated, for both men and women, with adversarial sexual beliefs, endorsement of a sexual double standard, and the beliefs that men are sex-driven, that appearance is important in dating, and that dating is a game. In all cases, however, these relationships were partially or totally mediated through viewer involvement. Men and women who watched RDPs tended to be less sexually experienced; there were few other correlations with sexual behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,248

For some young people this took the form of simultaneously accommodating and resisting subject positions offered by traditional discourses of (hetero)sexuality.

Associations were then examined between eight dimensions of TV viewing and seven sexual outcome variables for a multiethnic sample of 314 students aged 1820. Both viewing amount and viewer involvement emerged as significant correlates of participants sexual attitudes, expectations, and behavior. In particular, greater exposure and greater involvement with TV's sexual content were associated with stronger endorsement of recreational attitudes toward sex, higher expectations of the sexual activity of one's peers, and more extensive sexual experience. When all the viewing factors were tested together, viewer involvement emerged as a more consistent predictor of the sexual outcomes examined, and these associations were stronger among females than among males.",1,259

The current research provides a more in-depth explanation of gender differences in acceptance of casual sex offers via 4 (quasi-) experiments. First, using a person-perception paradigm, I assessed people's impressions of women and men who proposed a casual sexual encounter in the same manner that confederates in Clark and Hatfield did. Women and men agreed that female proposers were more intelligent, successful, and sexually skilled than men who made the same proposals. Second, I demonstrated that the large gender differences from the original Clark and Hatfield study could be eliminated by asking participants to imagine proposals from (attractive and unattractive) famous individuals, friends, and same-gender individuals. Next, I assessed factors associated with likelihood of agreeing to the casual sex proposal. The extent to which women and men believed that the proposer would be sexually skilled predicted how likely they would be to engage in casual sex with this individual. Finally, I examined these factors in the context of actual encounters from the participants' previous experiences, and the results were replicated in this context. Overall findings suggest that the large gender differences Clark and Hatfield observed in acceptance of the casual sex offer may have more to do with perceived personality characteristics of the female versus male proposers than with gender differences among Clark and Hatfield's participants and that sexual pleasure figures largely in women's and men's decision making about casual sex.",1,261

Although not always labeled in this way, these theorists posit that the ""traditional sexual script"" supports and condones male sexual coercion against women and that this sexual script remains the normative dating script in North American society. This article first reviews the aspects of the traditional sexual script that have been theorized to promote and maintain sexual coercion by males. It then reviews the results of a program of research the author conducted in conjunction with colleagues and former graduate students; this research tested the validity of this theory for understanding coercive sexual interactions between dating partners. The author concludes that the traditional sexual script has proven useful as a framework for understanding sexual coercion in heterosexual dating relationships; however, the author's research gives reason to question the assertion that the traditional sexual script is the normative script for dating interactions; rather, it may be one of a number of common and traditional scripts. Moreover, the research has shown that the sharp distinctions between appropriate behavior for men and women in sexual dating situations are not present.

Individual counseling of those who are either HIV-antibody positive or at continuing risk of HIV infection is critical for reducing further transmission and for ensuring timely medical care. Specific recommendations are given for the following groups: persons who may have sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug abusers, persons who consider themselves at risk, women of childbearing age, persons planning marriage, persons undergoing medical evaluation or treatment, persons admitted to hospitals, persons in correctional systems, and prostitutes.

Although I did not know it at the time, the 1996 PWQ article represented a turning point in my career. My dissertation involved lengthy interviews with rape victims who sought emergency room services. In the process, I learned how naive I was about many aspects of field research, and more importantly, I realized that survivors' cognitions were much more ""sophisticated and adaptive"" than researchers, clinicians, and lay advocates recognized. When I first asked myself the question, ""What is alcohol's role in sexual assault?"" I did not realize how much I was oversimplifying the issue. Researchers have identified some of those pathways and circumstances, but there is much still to be learned. I am excited by the questions being generated by new researchers in the field and eager to see more of what we have learned translated into prevention and treatment programs for sexual assault perpetrators.

280,"Abbou, J. (2011",Double gender marking in French: A linguistic practice of anti sexism.,"Linguistic anti sexism is different from the institutional feminization of language. It involves practices of double gender marking which work to avoid the gender dichotomy. Working on a French written corpus, this paper will examine the forms of double gender marking, looking at typographic, morphosyntactical and rhetorical levels; then, it will analyse this gender-related practice as a use of language as a political tool. Those who use double gender are not driven by the desire to standardize linguistic practice, but rather to use practices for particular political purposes. The focus of this use is not to be prescriptive about language but rather to critique social realities. They do not do this work through institutions and the usual mechanisms of language planning, but rather deploy individual practices for ideological purposes. Although nonetheless, they still achieve a certain commonality of practice. Linguistic anti sexism and double gender marking are phenomena of micro-language planning achieved by individuals.

282,"Aguilera, R. M., et al. (2004",First sexual experiences in teenage inhalers. From sexual activity to eroticism?,"Sexuality may become a field for the expression of the interests of various groups, such as teenagers who have developed their own sexual styles in order to distinguish themselves as a generation. When these adolescents are also alcohol and drug users, the relationship between adolescence and sexuality becomes even more complex. It is often said that teenage alcohol and drug users begin their sex lives without protection, motivated more by external factors than by personal decisions and that they are more likely to contract sexually transmitted infections such as AIDS or have unwanted pregnancies. They report a higher number of sexual partners and a low condom use; very fewer women ask their partners to use condoms. This study explores the relationship between adolescence and certain aspects of sexuality within a group of teenager users of inhalants who also consumed other substances, it utilizes in-depth knowledge to explore elements for the analysis and understanding of the sexual practices of teenage users of various drugs that live in environments regarded as ""protected"" or of low-risk such as family and school. It is a qualitative research project in which the participants were contacted at schools through a combined procedure of convenience sampling and the snowball technique. Ten men (with an average age of 15) and 8 women (with an average age of 16) were given in-depth interviews that were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using the content analysis technique. Early results show that the subjective experiences of sexuality were reported to have taken place as part of a process of secularization of culture, which, as Amuchastegui has reported, has enabled dominant Catholic discourse to share spaces with those derived from personal practices and experiences. The results also reflect the influence of elements resulting from the discourse of modern medicine, which, together with traditional elements, shape their subjectivities, as described by Castro and Miranda. The different subjective experience in men and women (permeated by the cultural construction of sexual difference) of the physical and biological changes experienced as a result of puberty (in men, this involves ""becoming a man"", feeling better about themselves and experiencing sexual pleasure; while in women, it is a nuisance and a bother, and leads to greater social and familial control) may explain the fact that it is precisely at this age when the gender gap, becomes wider in women. This is due to the fact that men construct themselves, as far as gender is concerned, in a higher hierarchical position vis-a-vis women (""it's pretty awful being a woman""), while women assume that they are in a disadvantaged position. The fact that men (and even some women) state that the double sexual standard is ""natural"", led us to review the way in which relations between genders take place among teenagers. This will provide analytical elements for understanding the social ""double standard"" regarding consumption, this is far less questioned and much more highly tolerated in men than in women. Although pleasure and desire can be experienced by both men and women, for the former it is a ""natural need"" whereas for the latter it is something that ""must be controlled"". Women in general refer to penetration as being painful, whereas men refer to it as a pleasurable situation but in a context of being ""put to the test"".

283,"Airey, J. L. (2017",“He stood like one transfixed with thunder”: Male Rape and the Punishment of Libertinism in Eliza Haywood's Love in Excess.,"Midway through Eliza Haywood's Love in Excess, Count D'elmont falls victim to a bed trick at the hands of the sexually aggressive Melantha. While prior critics have overlooked this scene, it is central to Haywood's ideological purpose: the punishment of D'elmont's sexual aggression. He plans to rape Melliora, only to find himself violated in return. The novel creates a parallel between Alovisaâs relationship with Baron D'espernay and D'elmont's relationship with Melantha, one that forces D'elmont into a stereotypically female subject position as the victim of sexual assault. A similar pattern will hold throughout the novel as Dâelmont's libertine and violent impulses are punished with acts of sexual coercion perpetrated on his person. This essay therefore argues that Love in Excess seeks both to expose sexual double standards and to punish hypermasculinity and male libertinism. It is only when D'elmont has been stripped of his libertine aggression, only when he has experienced the traditionally feminine role in sexual pursuits, that he earns his happily ever after. Acts of sexual assault become, perversely, the instruments by which the novel civilizes male aggression into companionate bliss. Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",0,283

(2012",Accounting for women's orgasm and sexual enjoyment in college hookups and relationships.,"This article investigates the determinants of orgasm and sexual enjoyment in hookup and relationship sex among heterosexual college women and seeks to explain why relationship sex is better for women in terms of orgasm and sexual enjoyment. We use data from women respondents to a large online survey of undergraduates at 21 U.S. colleges and universities and from 85 in-depth interviews at two universities. We identify four general views of the sources of orgasm and sexual enjoyment-technically competent genital stimulation, partner-specific learning, commitment, and gender equality. We find that women have orgasms more often in relationships than in hookups. Regression analyses reveal that specific sexual practices, experience with a particular partner, and commitment all predict women's orgasm and sexual enjoyment. The presence of more sexual practices conducive to women's orgasm in relationship sex explains some of why orgasm is more common in relationships. Qualitative analysis suggests a double standard also contributes to why relationship sex is better for women: both men and women question women's (but not men's) entitlement to pleasure in hookups but believe strongly in women's (as well as men's) entitlement to pleasure in relationships. More attention is thus given to producing female orgasm in relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,284

A total of 15 in-depth interviews (1.5 to 2.5 hours each) with 13 women were conducted and analyzed through the lens of transcendental phenomenology. An analysis of antecedent factors revealed a confluence of sociopersonal characteristics (e.g., sexual definitions, attitudes, double standards, and age) and touristic attributes (e.g., the sense of temporariness/ephemerality, anonymity, and fun-oriented mentality depending on length, destination, and type of tourist experience) that underlie women's proclivity for and perceptions of sexual risk taking in certain travel scenarios. These result in myriad effects on physical, sexual health, sociocultural, mental, and emotional aspects of women's health and well-being. While the sociopersonal antecedents highlight the cross-pollination between sex-related perceptions in everyday life and touristic environments, the touristic antecedents emphasize the uniqueness of tourist experiences as the contexts for sexual risk taking. The findings address an underresearched topic in sex and tourism scholarship and offer implications for health education and intervention programs, pointing to the value of constructing the context-specific and gender-sensitive sexual health messages underpinned by the ideas of women's empowerment and sexual agency.

Girls in a sex education class posed almost 3 times as many questions as boys. Girls' inquiries, in descending order, related to female physiology and the birth process, social implications of sexual behavior, petting, social-sexual behavior, male physiology, intercourse, and contraception.

(2014",Brainy broads: Images of women's intellect in film noir.,"In the ""golden age"" of classic Hollywood, by the 1940s, representations of strong, intelligent, independent women in film challenged stereotypes, yet faced scrutiny. Several actresses such as Katharine Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich were labeled ""box office poison"" and ridiculed for their bold, passionate personas, which hurt their careers. Many women on screen encountered a double standard; they were criticized for shrewd behavior and independent mindedness -as crazy, angry, aggressive, or unduly masculine-whereas men were praised for having these same qualities: being strong, brave, and powerful cinematic heroes, applauded for using their brains, being determined, and showing conviction. Images of women's intellect in motion pictures, such as heroines in film noir crime narratives, strained against negative typecasting. Rather than being presented as thoughtful, multifaceted, intelligent individuals, women were often reduced to simplistic stereotypes-either lethal sexual temptresses or naive victims-thus undermining their intellect in screen portrayals that emphasized sex and/or erotic violence: the toxic blonde femme fatale or gullible innocent redeemer. I will investigate screen images of women's intellect in film noir after World War II, such as Alfred Hitchcock's female gothic noir thriller Spellbound (1945), to examine how intelligent women were channeled from professional careers back into the home from 1945 to 1950.

This article is based on findings from a qualitative study that sought to explore the way national-religious Jewish matchmakers act toward the issue of beauty. These matchmakers face a beauty dilemma as they try to comply with their male clients' exacting and steep demands regarding the desired bride's beauty, while at the same time they wish to adhere to this Jewish religious ethos. Twenty-five national-religious Jewish matchmakers in Israel were interviewed. Findings show that they tend to cope with this dilemma by using two complementary strategies: On one hand they try, albeit unsuccessfully, to persuade their male clients to decrease the importance they attached to the appearance of the desired bride. On the other hand, they demonstrate a kind of pragmatic acceptance and compliance with the demands of their male clients; most of them tend to advise their female clients on how to improve their outward attractiveness in accordance to generally accepted standards of beauty, in order to promote their female clients' chances of finding a groom. In doing so, they unconsciously contribute to the perpetuation of the double standard of beauty and the sex objectification of women.",0,292

294,"Buchanan, K. S. (2010",The sex discount.,"This Article interrogates the sexual morality of Equal Protection. Gender equality jurisprudence reveals the unacknowledged influence of a traditional, heteronormative conception of sexual morality-the sexual double standard-that often sets the parameters of gender equality. When the U.S. Supreme Court frames a gendered law as limiting participation in education, the workplace, or civic life, it tends to apply a demanding form of heightened scrutiny that few gendered laws can survive. When, on the other hand, it frames a gendered law as governing the consequences of illicit sex, it tends to apply what I call the sex discount, replacing the rigorous scrutiny mandated by its public equality cases with an unacknowledged, much more deferential form of equal protection review. The Court invokes biological differences between men and women to justify this deference. But the sex discount does not genuinely accommodate gender differences regarding pregnancy, sexuality, or parenthood. Courts tend to reject reproductive justifications for inequality in publk life; they tend to assume that biological Ã£fferences are irrelevant when a heterosexual couple is married; they have applied the sex discount to gendered laws that serve no interest in protecting fetal life; and they apply a sex discount in cases of antigay discrimination that do not invoke reproductive or sexual behavior. Rather, the sex discount authorizes governments to use gendered laws to enforce traditional gender norms about the morality of sex: to discourage abortion, to allow antigay discrimination, and to ""incentivize"" heterosexual marriage.",0,294

The data show that premarital sexual activity during adolescence, especially after age 15 years, is viewed as normal and acceptable in Reunion and Seychelles, whereas such activity remains stigmatized, especially for adolescent girls, in Comoros, Madagascar, and to a lesser extent in Mauritius. However, in all five islands, traditional norms of masculinity and double sexual standards prevailed. Female premarital virginity was portrayed as an ideal that is increasingly in conflict with adolescents' contemporary life, and in Madagascar, Mauritius, and Comoros, and sexually active female adolescents are facing high social risks. Early childbearing and sexually transmitted diseases also emerged as important concerns for adolescents in Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles. Lack of access to reproductive health information and services seemed particularly serious among out-of-school and rural adolescents, especially in Comoros and Madagascar.

It concludes with a call to action, arguing that: more women need to enter into politics, each of us must recognize our own and make others aware of their overt sexism and subtle biases, the public must acknowledge and change the often double standards that exist for women but not men, and we must realize that a win for women is also often a win for men.

Increasingly, many of these programs have moved away from the traditional workplace- based sitcom toward the work-related sitcom/dramedy, in which the characters are more often in need of work than actually employed.

In many cases, women characters are framed as the most economically unstable, which is a change from previous portrayals. With the move away from workplace-based sitcoms, we see fewer and fewer of these organizationally-stable, often strong, women characters on television. This dissertation investigates these post-recessionary televisual trends concerning women in (and out of) the workplace through the examination of nine situation comedies (and dramedies), spanning nearly 600 episodes in total, from four different networks. The nine programs examined are Community, Parks and Recreation, The Office, 30 Rock (all from NBC), 2 Broke Girls (CBS), Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 (ABC), Enlightened, Girls, and Veep (the latter three from HBO). My study examines how post-recessionary anxiety has given rise to an increasing number of women characters being shown outside of the workplace, or at best struggling to stay afloat in their already-existing, unstable jobs. I argue that with the decline of workplace-based sitcoms and the influx of women-centric, work-related sitcoms, strong women characters and situations where these women can flourish are increasingly being replaced by characters and situations that represent the continued cultural shift to the anxieties and ideologies typical of postfeminism and justified by a post-recession economy. Additionally, my project aims to answer, what exactly are the (post)feminist messages being put forth in today's workrelated sitcoms about women (and, by proxy, men) as organizational and economic beings in this post-recession era? To answer this question, although feminist textual analysis is a constant tool throughout the dissertation, I apply different methods to analyze the programs: the application of a ""viewing strip"" (a concept borrowed from Newcomb and Hirsch, 1983/1994), toward a network in which four related programs in a row aired; the employment of character analysis, toward two comedies that applied the broadest use of humor and archetype characters; and the examination of ""paratexts"" (a term borrowed from Gray, 2010), in the case of controversial and polarizing programs. In the process of employing these different approaches, I uncovered two separate phenomena regarding portrayals of working women and the critical response to these portrayals. The first phenomenon I have dubbed ""Post-Recessionary Sexism."" This term extends Douglas's (2010) concept of Enlightened Sexism to today's post-recessionary backdrop and its new manifestations of nuanced sexism and patriarchy, including the trivialization of sexual harassment in the workplace. ""The Critical Double Standard"" is my label for the second phenomenon. The concept stems from the highly-gendered nature of critic reviews surrounding women protagonists. Together, both Post-Recessionary Sexism and The Critical Double Standard paint a telling picture of how working women of post-recessionary sitcoms (and dramedies) are being portrayed and perceived.

Unfortunately, they have been misinterpreted as evidence of a continuing increase in the frequency of premarital relations. The data presented indicate that the incidence rate leveled off after 1930. What has occurred is that standards are ""catching up"" with behavior. Counselors, educators and administrators must be cognizant of this changing culture.

Ofreneo (2014",Maintaining a ,"How young women negotiate sexual agency in first sex is contingent upon the specific social construction of female and male sexuality and the sexual double standards in a particular local context. Within Philippine Roman Catholicism, a strong religious moral discourse equates virginity with a woman's honor, making first sex or virginity loss a source of shame. This has implications for women's experiences of sexual agency. We report on research in which a group of eight young Filipina women wrote their memories of first sex and collectively analyzed these memories. Using thematic analysis, we derived five themes about why they engaged in first sex: (1) ""giving in,"" (2) ""nadala"" or ""carried away,"" (3) love, (4) self-expression, and (5) coercion. Avoiding sexual agency in giving in and nadala is linked to the experience of pain, loss, and shame. Recognizing sexual agency by articulating first sex as a need for sexual self-expression is tied to the experience of pleasure. The absence of sexual agency is seen in the experience of coercion and subsequent trauma. Despite variations in these women's constructions of first sex, each can be seen as ways of preserving a woman's social status and maintaining a ""good girl"" position.

We used data from in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 male and 15 female indigenous young people to explore gendered sexual behaviour and its implications for STI reduction. There was a pervasive 'double standard' where young men were expected to be sexually aggressive and young women were expected to resist sexual advances; but we also observed 'alternative' or non-hegemonic behaviours. Specifically, young women were often very active participants in sexual negotiations, could refuse condom use and sometimes pressured their male partners to not use condoms. Young men also described being the object of coerced sex, and did not always perceive female sexual desire in negative terms, and were not always receptive to sex. The gendered sexual attitudes and behaviours in our sample were much more complex than usually described in the literature.

308,"Dialmy, A. (2010",Sexuality and Islam.,"This paper deals with three major questions: (1) What are the sexual norms defined by the sacred texts (Koran and Sunna)? (2) What are the sexual practices currently observed among Moslems? (3) To which extent are current sexual practices of Moslems dissociated from Islamic sexual norms? Sexual standards in Islam are paradoxical: on the one hand, they allow and actually are an enticement to the exercise of sexuality but, on the other hand, they discriminate between male and female sexuality, between marital and pre- or extramarital sexuality, and between heterosexuality and homosexuality. Men are given more rights with regard to the expression of their sexuality; women are forbidden to have extramarital sex (with their slaves) and both genders to have homosexual relationships. The combination of these paradoxical standards with modernisation leads to the current back and forth swing of sexual practices between repression and openness. Partial modernisation leads to greater sexual tolerance. But restrictive sexual standards have gathered strength and have become idealised as a result of the current radicalisation of Islam. This swing of the pendulum between repression and openness is illustrated by phenomena such as public harassment, premarital sexuality, female pleasure, prostitution, and homosexuality. Currently, Islam is not any more the only reference which provides guidance concerning sexual practices but secularisation of sexual laws is still politically unthinkable today. So the only solution is to achieve reform in the name of Islam, through the reinterpretation of repressive holy texts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,308

The Napoleonic Penal Code prescribed much harsher penalties for wives convicted of adultery than for husbands found guilty of the same crime. Nonetheless, by the late nineteenth century a growing number of wives separated from abusive husbands and in some cases took up with lovers. An analysis of the verdicts in the important Correctional Court of Marseille shows that the judges became increasingly sympathetic to such women when they were charged with adultery.

He defined it in the following terms: ""The plaidoirie [defense summation] sentimentale is, precisely, that which seeks to move; one can say: that which comes from the heart of the attorney, to address that of the judges.""1 The plaidoirie sentimentale had existed in France before 1800, but it entered its golden age in the nineteenth century, and became a specialized form of judicial oratory.2 It developed chiefly in response to the introduction of trial by jury in 1791. Attorneys had to craft a rhetorical approach that would appeal to these ""simple citizens,"" and for this, sentimental eloquence was ideal;3 however, no recent scholar has attempted a systematic study of this important form of courtroom rhetoric from its origins in the early nineteenth century to its gradual replacement after 1890 or there- abouts by a more fact-based, ""positivist"" approach.4 This is unfortunate, because the history of the plaidoirie sentimentale reveals much. It includes juridical issues such as how the rhetorical practices of magistrates themselves contributed to the affective nature of French jury trial and the impact of the abolition in 1881 the rÃ©sumÃ© (summing up),which had been the judge's one means of countering the effect on a jury of an eloquent defense summation. It also reveals important changes in the attitudes of judges and jurors toward male mistreatment of women and the sexual ""double standard"" from the middle of the nineteenth century on and of how attorneys of the era drew on both the ""new"" emotion of sympathy and the ""old"" one of honor to persuade jurors to acquit.

This article examines 15 young womenâs negotiation of the sexual double standard in their talk of heterosexual casual sex. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis, with borrowed insights from discourse analysis, within a constructionist framework. All 15 women in this study gave accounts of an agentic and desiring sexuality, yet talked about casual sex and a sexual reputation in contradictory and contested ways. Three main themes were identified: the (un)acceptability of casual sex, a sexual reputation is what other girls have, and the making of a slut. Although an enduring sexual double standard was identified, all participants challenged its relevance and appropriateness. However, a sexual double standard also seeped into womenâs accounts when talking about other women and the threat of garnering a negative sexual reputation was linked to womenâs silencing of their own casual sex experiences.

318,"Forte, M., et al. (2006",From acute victimization to chronic victimization: Socio-cognitive approach to a differential tolerance threshold.,"Background: Work, for many years reduced to a purely instrumental dimension, proves to be a true microcosm of society, with its informal modes, its emotional networks and its series of evils and dilemmas. This human apprehension of the professional sphere tends to reveal a pole with multiple facets, some of which have long been concealed, but whose individual, social and economic extent can't let people ignore them. This social perception, which contributes to regard work as sacred and makes it impervious to any aggression, should be abandoned. Bearing this in mind, our study endeavors to show that work and victim are far more overlapping than antagonistic realities; it aims at determining the impact of two aggressive methods via the professional pole, namely: moral harassment at work and armed attacks within bank premises. Such an approach tends to unify health psychology, occupational psychology and victimology, thus opening a breach in the stereotyped view which crystallizes the professional sphere into a kind of representative noose devoid of the most human bases. Method: Since this study is the subject of a comparative research strategy, its required the constitution of three independent samples: ten harassment victims; seven armed attack victims; ten witnesses, all salaried employees; they had not been subjected to either type of attack but were questioned about a working life event seen as stressful. The three groups, set up according to sex and age considerations, agreed to be subjected to a semi-directive interview. Considering the exploratory nature of this present research, the process proved to be most suitable since, through the filter of the people's subjectivity, it clearly determined the meaning granted by the victim to the aversive situation. In order to comply with a standardization preoccupation, each interview was identically structured using a preset question grid and similar operating conditions. The data collected were then subjected to four levels of analysis. An analysis of contents (1), centred on a logic-semantic frequency dimension of speech, obtained a simplified representation of the whole of the data. This first level of analysis, supplemented by descriptive statistics, validated, in the second stage, the significance of the differences in the semantic categories. In the third stage, an analysis of adjacency associated with a factorial analysis of the correspondences, delineated the differentiating values of the three groups of subjects. A final stage of analysis, centred on a multiaxial dimension, permitted the constitution of clinical pictures. Results: In accordance with the general assumption, the results show that the victims reveal a dominating presence of mobbing signs related to depression and anxiety symptomatology with an acute emotional threshold. Hold-up victims also show undoubted but significantly less harmful consequences. These victims have turned out to be more centred on the anxious pole and the social and family fields. Moreover, while the victims of harassment unanimously evoke the emergence of a break-up in dynamics conveying a freeze of the social matrix, some of the victims of armed attacks express secondary benefits through the setting-up of gregarious dynamics on professional as well as on family level. Discussion. Considering these results, there seems to be a double induction of such a difference. The social evaluation tends to be a first explanatory inference as for the expressed tolerance level. As a matter of fact, the frequential analysis reveals a different perception of the attacker. Conclusion: Considering these first results, which call for further study, our impression is that it seems to be relevant to consider the setting-up of psychological therapy programs adapted to the very nature of each victimization case.

(2000",Social expectations for sexuality among the elderly.,"In personal interviews with 40 men and women aged 60 to 82 (median age of 68) in communities of different age-concentration, age-segregation was found to enhance opportunity for meeting a sexual partner in old age. Age-segregation did not enable more permissive norms for sexuality than the age-integrated environment This was due to a small-town atmosphere and additional social pressures within the extensive group-structuring built into the retirement community, which fosters distinctive normative enclaves. Seniors in both the age-segregated and age-integrated environments reported that they are not concerned about younger persons' and societal expectations of asexuality. Senior sexuality was instead found to be governed by personal sexual ethics involving norms derived out of experience and interaction contexts. Marital status and a notion of flexible intimacy were described as important for the continuation or cessation of sexual activity in old age, in particular, an older widow's psychological marital status: whether she perceives herself as still-married or single-again. Community age-concentration and regular exercise were not found to be important for sexual activity. Among older women, norms for sexual initiative in the bedroom, and aggressiveness in partner-seeking behaviors were also found. Religiosity was not described by respondents as important for sexual norms. Permissive norms for casual sex, multiple partners and cohabiting are described. A restrictive norm for homosexuality was found within the age-segregated environment. A personal hygiene norm was found for senior attractiveness standards. Normative sources are described, as well as normative sanctions, involving gender-based double-standards. A thematic analysis and verification was conducted, with the assistance of the textual interpretation program, ATLAS/ti. It is suggested that it is not sexual conservativism in seniors that leads to stereotypes of asexuality, but rather, restrictive norms for the public display of affection, in addition to, the cringe factor, whereby senior sexuality is conceptualized in a similar frame of reference as parental or grandparental sexuality. A filter theory of sexual expectation in old age is put forth, in which personal sexual ethics serve to filter out negative expectations of asexuality. Sexuality is presented as a possible buffer to becoming old. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,319

Many studies have indicated that the use of pornography was associated with more permissive sexual attitudes and tended to be linked with stronger gender-stereotypical sexual beliefs. It also seemed to be associated with other risky behaviors and sexual promiscuity. Pornography exposure in conservative societies leads to conflicts with religious and cultural taboos. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize the barriers and difficulties that prevent sexual discourse in the Arab society and enable pornography viewing according to the perceptions of adolescents and mothers. Methods: This study involved qualitative research methods and in-depth interviews with 40 participants. This study included 20 Arab adolescents, sampled by 2 age groups (14-16 years and 16-18 years), and 20 mothers of adolescents from both sexes. Results: The findings indicate that mothers ""turn a blind eye"" to porn viewing and sexual activity by boys; however, they show a sweeping prohibition and denial of such behavior by girls. Boys reported viewing porn routinely, whereas girls denied doing so, but admitted that their female friends watched porn. The study also found that boys experienced guilt during and after viewing porn as a result of the clash between modernity and traditional values. The mothers and adolescents emphasized the need for an open sexual discourse to reduce violent behaviors such as Web-based sexual harassment, including sending videos and pictures of naked girls, often accompanied by threats and blackmail. Conclusions: It is necessary to find a way to encourage a significant sexual discourse to prevent the violent consequences of its absence in the Arab society. A controlled, transparent, and critical sexual discourse could help youth make more informed decisions concerning the search for sexual content, porn viewing, and sexual behavior.

(2001",The social construction of sexual interaction in heterosexual relationships: A qualitative analysis.,"The present study examined the process by which couples, in the context of a heterosexual romantic relationship, participate in sexual activity. As they did so, their interactions helped to construct their relationship. Social construction theory and the gender perspective provided the theoretical foundation for this qualitative research. Nine heterosexual couples were recruited primarily through an introductory course in human sexuality. Each member of these nine couples was interviewed separately using a qualitative, semistructured interview format. Each interview lasted about an hour and questions focused on behavioral and sexual expectations for women and men in romantic relationships. Other areas examined included prior dating relationships and sexual experiences, sexual activity in the present relationship, comfort and satisfaction with the specific sexual experiences in the current relationship, satisfaction with their sexual relationship, and general relationship satisfaction. Qualitative data analysis techniques were used to arrive at five major themes. Results illustrated how women and men constructed notions of gender-appropriate sexual interaction as they participated in sexual activity in their relationship. First, participants' views of sexuality, the meanings they attached to sexual acts, their expectations of specific sexual encounters and of sexual relationships in general, and the choices they made in the navigation process were often based upon social and cultural expectations of what sex is. Second, these meanings and expectations combined to produce behavior that was gendered. Third, choices participants made with regard to their current sexual behaviors were very much affected by their previous sexual experiences with their current partner as well as with past partners. Fourth, participants' original social and cultural expectations were modified within the context of their current relationship. Fifth, context specific experiences affected the navigation of sexual activity. Results suggest that sexual relationships themselves were constructed and reconstructed as relationship partners interacted with each other and that sexual interaction in general was heavily affected by the sexual double standard. Participants did not always recognize however, that the double standard was active in and affecting their relationship. Additionally, couples socially constructed sex as being penile vaginal intercourse, a construction that invariably led to a higher frequency of male orgasms.

Participants discussed select photos in relation to self-generated topics. Results One overarching theme, double standards in expectations about sexual communication, and 2 related subthemes, contrasting gender expectations in sexual desire and pleasure and confirming ideologies in sexual taboos and disconnections, emerged during discussions. Discussion The persistence of a double standard placing responsibility for sexual protection on young women indicates a need to design health education programs centered on a critical examination of gendered and sexual expectations. Translation to Health Education Practice Research findings on gender inequities should be translated to health education practice. In sexuality education this means conducting activities that address subjectivity and agency as they are accorded to participants in their everyday lives. Â© 2013 AAHPERD.",0,326

(2004","Hauling down the double standard: Feminism, social purity and sexual science in late nineteenth-century Britain.","Nineteenth-century feminism and the related social purity movement, and the emergent scientific discourse of 'sexology', are usually seen as antagonistic. Both trends, in fact, were in profound opposition to the widespread assumption that the double moral standard was an embodiment of 'natural' transhistorical law. This article suggests that feminist agitation against the Contagious Diseases Acts of the 1860s (and other manifestations of the deterious legal status of women) overtly attacked unthinking social assumptions about sex and gender, destablishing concepts about the naturalness of the existing sexual system and creating the context for the pioneers of sexology to interrogate even further accepted notions of gender and sexuality.

L., & Schultz, B. (2007) Double standard: Why women have trouble getting jobs in local television sports. Journal of Sports Media, 2(1), 77â101). What has not been explored, however, is the persistence of this double standard through a Foucauldian lens. Using Michel Foucaultâs (Foucault, M. (1978). The history of sexuality:Vol. 1, an introduction. New York: Vintage Books) power/knowledge paradigm, this Foucauldian discourse analysis uses one-on-one interviews with women sportscasters and textual analysis to grapple with this previously unexplored aspect of one of electronic sports mediaâs longest standing gendered double standards. Using these data, this article argues that post-feminist discourses (Gill, R. (2007) Gender and the media. Cambridge: Polity Press; McRobbie, A. (2004) Post-feminism and popular culture. Feminist Media Studies, 4(3), 255â264) have a mutually informing relationship with three manifestations of the electronic sports mediaâs gendered double standard of appearance: sportscaster hiring and retention, inequitable media consumer evaluations of on-screen appearance, and expectations for sportscaster dress, the latter of which have required many women to wear increasingly revealing clothing, a trend this article refers to as nightclubification. While post-feminist analysis explicates the nuances of the appearance double standard and the electronic sports mediaâs contributions to our cultureâs constructions of gender relations, Foucauldian discourse analysis demonstrates how the appearance double standard has been taken for granted and how it might inform other obstacles women in the industry must navigate.

With her fist defiantly raised and her shirtsleeves rolled up, Rosie was an asexual warrior on the homefront. But thousands of women supported the war effort not by working in heavy war industries, but by providing morale-boosting services to soldiers, ranging from dances at officers' clubs to more blatant forms of sexual services, such as prostitution. While the de-sexualized Rosie was celebrated, women who used their sexuality-either intentionally or inadvertently-to serve their country encountered a contradictory morals campaign launched by government and social agencies, which shunned female sexuality while valorizing masculine sexuality. This double-standard was accurately summed up by a government official who dubbed these women""patriotutes"": part patriot, part prostitute. Marilyn E. Hegarty explores the dual discourse on female sexual mobilization that emerged during the war, in which agencies of the state both required and feared women's support for, and participation in, wartime services. The equation of female desire with deviance simultaneously over-sexualized and desexualized many women, who nonetheless made choices that not only challenged gender ideology but defended their right to remain in public spaces.

Change was seen to be a product of social forces that imposed unique constraints upon the individual, and samples were selected in a manner that precluded cultural diversity by class and race, as explained below. Whether focused upon the individual or society, however, the individual and social difference theories of young peoples sexual development typically ignored social oppression and the roots of sexual inequality, both in the United States and globally. Thus, social oppression has been omitted from narratives of gender inequality, sexual coercion, dating patterns, unintended pregnancy, and the double standards facing young women (Tolman 2003). Of late, scholars examining the forces of structural violence in human life have turned to the classic text on social oppression, Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1970), as a general guide to analyzing the roots of social difference and social oppression in particular. However, it is noteworthy that Freire never discusses sexuality in his work. It is time to rethink theories of sexuality from the perspective of a social difference paradigm, which would allow consideration of the contributions of culture and society to sexual development and of the expanding role played by social meaning systems and social practices as defining features of sexual cultures.

Yet knowledge of their notions and expectations regarding these issues has the potential to improve care and inform the development of sexuality education programmes. This paper reports the findings of a study which relied on in-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions to investigate notions of sex, sexuality, and relationships among 120 boys aged 10-21 in rural southeastern Nigeria. Emerging data suggest that the popular images of sex, sexuality, and relationship among the boys support the notion of the cult of the male, which consists in a heady mixture of paternalism, systematic subordination of girls, and the glorification and idolization of male sexuality and sexual prowess. Boys generally held a penis-centred view of sex and tended to liken sexual intercourse and relationships with girls to encounters during which girls were conquered, subdued, and demystified. The ideology of a double standard, in which males feel morally and physically edified by multiple sex encounters and viewed females as morally demeaned by the same, was observed among the boys. The findings show the need for approaches to sexuality education to be sensitive to the cultural contexts within which these notions are formed and sustained among boys in local communities.

Analyses identified various ways in which the sexual double standard was disrupted, including challenging the language of the sexual double standard, articulating sexual desire, and positioning of self and (hetero)sex within alternative discourses. The findings also suggest, however, that voices of resistance to the sexual double standard may be muted and individual rather than collective, and that, accordingly, every effort should be made by those working with young women to recognize and support attempts to disrupt the sexual double standard.

The concept of role ""shift"" as opposed to role ""change"" recognizes the need to consider the progressively complex interactions and processes which occur intraindividually, interindividually, culturally, and historically as individuals interact with, react to, and act upon their environment. Recently, attention was directed toward the male only from the perspective of his response to the new woman. Dependency, diffusion, decentralization, and demystification are four issues underlying the shift in role focus. The feminist movement which sought to give women equal rights with men has opened the way for women to enter the workplace. This has created a double standard where men are victims of the traditional stereotypic male worker, provider roles. Already some men in dual career families are attempting to integrate occupational and family roles. They accept and actively support their wives' careers and value close relationships with their children. Men are developing their own support systems, and men's studies is an accepted and important discipline in some universities.

It relies on interviews and focus groups to examine how college students make decisions within the context of the ""hook-up culture"" (Heldman and Wade 2010) prominent on American campuses. Patterns in the qualitative data are examined quantitatively using the Online College Life Survey. To understand how students make decisions in hookup culture, I examine their views of relationships, how they enact relationships, and the effects of hooking up on relationships. I that students envision relationships in their future, and choose not to expend time on them during their early undergraduate studies. Counter to common stereotypes, both male and female students express experience with and desire for relationships, which often form after a period of hooking up, not traditional, yet high-status students are more likely to experience and relationships. Hooking up also impacts relationships, as students rely on gendered stereotypes to evaluate their peers' behaviors and motivations; females think that males want sex, and males expect females to want a relationship, which complicates things for students whose desires are counter to these stereotypes. I next examine decisions about choice of partner and sexual activity. Gender expectations shape these choices for undergraduates. Men make decisions based on the accolades they expect from peers, while women make decisions to shield them from being labeled a slut, evidence of the double standard. To men, a ""good"" partner is one who is highly desired by others; women consider a ""good"" partner someone who is trusting and non-coercive. These gendered stereotypes also factor into sexual behaviors, where women engage in sex acts to cement the bond with her partner, as evidence of the relational imperative. Young men are also affected, and engage in sex acts when they do not want to, but do so to mitigate against any threat to his masculinity. As a result of gender role expectations, much of the sex on college campuses may not be fully desired by the parties, but it is an agentic choice because of the social outcome it produces.

We conducted 94 in-depth open-ended interviews with women of reproductive age (16-49 years) living in New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Four major themes are explored here: (1) what women do and do not do: unspoken gendered assumptions; (2) focus on partner's pleasure; (3) juggling responsibilities: sex as a chore; and (4) women's sexual motivations. Findings suggest sexual double standards and gender expectations continue to pervade women's sexual and contraceptive practices. We found that women performed their femininity by focusing on enabling their male partner's pleasure, while simultaneously ignoring their own sexual desires, wishes or interests. Accompanying new-found freedoms are new-found responsibilities, as women now add managing modern contraceptives and a good sex life to their list of tasks alongside paid employment, domestic labour and childrearing.

Rather than take everyday accounts of adolescent peer sexual harassment as ""objective truths"", this research examined how the meanings of this category of conduct are socially constructed through discursive practices and drawn on to account for sexual conflict among peers in grade schools. In order to examine the ways in which adolescent peer sexual harassment is constructed and discursively drawn on in talk, teachers and female adolescents were the focus of study. Two types of ""texts"" were analysed using discourse analysis. (1) interviews with five female and two male grade school teachers; and (2) interviews with eight junior high and high school young women. This analysis highlights some ways in which the participants rejected ""sexual harassment"" as a useful way to understand problematic peer relations. Of particular interest was the way in which teacher accounts reflected their own subject positions as ""good teachers"" and the implications for the use of feminist discourse in their everyday working environments that are dominated by liberal humanism. Teachers constructed peer conflict within a normal/abnormal dichotomy that worked to re-produce sexual double standards and a ""deficient"" model of femininity. Female adolescents constructed a version of sexual harassment as ""unwanted sexual attention"" and subsequently rejected the term as useful in accounting for sexual conflict perpetrated by male peers. Of particular interest was the way in which ""sexual harassment"" was talked about as a ""sexual issue"" rather than about an issue of power relations and gender. Victims of sexual harassment were constructed as demonstrating atypical sexuality. Drawing on the term then was problematic for female adolescents as they were working towards constructing subject positions as ""properly maturing female adolescents"".

This study emphasizes personal dimensions of women's lives as they negotiated the treacherous terrain of sexuality and coming of age between 1985 and 1995.

The women who participated in this study all lived with the reputation of a ""slut"" at some point during their high school experience.

U.S. immigration officials require that âgreen cardâ petitioning couples demonstrate that their relationships are âvalid and subsistingâ (i.e., for love) and not fraudulent (i.e., for immigration papers). These requirements are ostensibly gender and racially neutral, but migration itself is not; men and women petitioners seek partners in different regions and solicit advice from similar others about the potential obstacles to their petitionsâ success. Using an online ethnography and textual analysis of conversation threads on a large online immigration forum where U.S. petitioners exchange such information, I examine how gendered standards of legitimacy are applied to family and sexuality and used discursively among petitioners to achieve genuineness and define red flags indicating potential marriage fraud. I argue that forum members police immigration requests even before cases reach an immigration officer. Petitioners use the formal criteria of U.S. immigration in ways that reveal gender ideologies, expectations for conformity to a gendered hegemonic family ideal, and sexual double standards surrounding sexual agency, fertility, and desirability. These intersectional norms shape membersâ online discussions about the suitability of marriages and of the migration of noncitizen partners to the United States.

Twenty-five semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with women at risk of HIV/AIDS, aged 21-49 years, at Voluntary Counseling and Testing Centers or Drop in Centers in Tehran, Iran. Results showed that perceived gender norms were essential barriers of protective behavior through sexual socialization, male control over condom use and sexual decision-making, male pleasure predominating in sexual encounters and sexual double standards, and economic dependencies.

This paper argues that this is an unjustified double standard that reinforces problematic gendered stereotypes about male and female sexuality. I first reject three potential justifications for making penile penetration a condition of rape: (1) it is physically impossible for a woman to rape a man; (2) it is a more serious offence to forcibly penetrate someone than to force them to penetrate you; (3) rape is a gendered crime. I argue that, as these justifications fail, a woman having sex with a man without his consent ought to be considered rape. I then explain some further reasons that this matters. I argue that, not only is it unjust, it is also both a cause and a consequence of harmful stereotypes and prejudices about male and female sexuality: (1) men are âalways up for sexâ; (2) womenâs sexual purity is more important than menâs; (3) sex is something men do to women. Therefore, I suggest that, if rape law were made gender neutral, these stereotypes would be undermined and this might make some (albeit small) difference to the problematic ways that sexual relations are sometimes viewed between men and women more generally.

Qualitative research into women's sexualities, sexual relationships and sexual health has often been conducted from social constructionist and critical feminist perspectives. Discourse analytic research has focused on the ways in which these issues are constructed and the implications of these constructions for women's (and men's) sexual health and wellbeing. I therefore used this narrative approach to analyse personal narrative accounts that were co- constructed during interviews with nine young women (aged 16-24) who were identified as having high levels of socio- economic disadvantage and came from an ex- mining community in the North of the UK. However, it would be overly simplistic to suggest that romantic narratives and the male sex drive discourse were straightforwardly deterministic of these young women's narratives. My argument is not that the young women's sexual experiences were straight- forwardly determined by these dominant narratives of 'romance' and of 'sexual equality' but that the women drew upon both of these narratives in making sense of their experiences whilst resisting and challenging dominant gendered norms through counter- narratives.

This study is a report of interviews with 153 adolescents aged 15 to 18 from three very different backgrounds: homeless youth, andAnglo-Australian and Greek-Australian young people living at home in a large Australian city. A number of themes about the ways young people describe their sexual worlds emerged from analysis of the interviews. The themes concerned permissiveness, romance, beliefs about both the âdouble standardâ and the control of sexual urges, sexual aggression, and sexual âregrets.â The importance of these themes in influencing sexual self-definition and sexual behaviour is presented. The extent to which young people undergo conflict and questioning in integrating their ideas about sexuality and their actual sexual behaviours is considered.

The aim was to develop more detailed descriptions of the dimension of adolescent sexuality and related these dimensions to sexual risk, that is, the tendency to engage in unprotected intercourse, an activity which increases vulnerability to AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. To this end, seven themes were isolated from the interview scripts, these being permissiveness, double standards, belief about sexual control (the Id Factor), romance, regrets about permissiveness, sexual aggression, and questioning. Measures of four of these themes were constructed, and sex and sub-group differences explored, as were the relationships between themes and sexual risk. The implications of different ""pathways"" to sexual risk-taking were discussed. Â© 1992.",0,354

The practice of labeling young women is a form of sexual harassment that effects the lives of not only the young women who receive the labels, but serves to perpetuate the sexual double standard prevalent in our culture that positions men and women unequally. This study presents the stories of twelve women aged 25-35 as they reflect back on their experiences with receiving such a label while in school. Through the use of interviews, the women discuss their particular experiences with attaining the label and also discuss how such a label has effected their self-concepts and life choices. The women also recount how their school staff treated the issue of sexual labeling. Their stories represent some of the painful consequences the attainment of sexual labels can have for women.

(2011",Gender and sexual vulnerability of young women in Africa: Experiences of young girls in secondary schools in Uganda.,"Sexuality is part and parcel of students' experiences of schooling manifested in personal friendships, relations and social interaction. These encounters constitute sites within which sexual identities are developed, practiced and actively produced through processes of negotiation. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in 14 selected secondary schools in Central and Western Uganda, the study illuminates gendered sexual vulnerability within patterns of social interaction and young girls gendered experiences and negotiation of their sexuality. The study reveals that through social and discursive practices, students construct complex gendered relations of domination and subordination that position boys and girls differently, often creating gender inequalities and sexual vulnerability for those gendered as girls. Girls' vulnerability is characterised by confusing and traumatic experiences fraught with double standards and silences. Typical of these experiences are complex tensions and contradictions surrounding constructions of sexuality that are predicated upon unequal power and gender relations characterised by homophobia, misogyny, control of female sexuality and sexual abuse and exploitation, all which work against girls' expression of sexuality. Gender sensitive sexuality education is identified as a valuable site of intervention to address such vulnerabilities and promote gender equality and equity in society.

While the underreporting of men's STIs has been linked to masculinities, little is known about how women interpret and respond to heterosexual men's sexual health practices. The findings drawn from this qualitative study of 34 young women reveal how femininities can be complicit in sustaining, as well as being critical of and disrupting masculine discourses that affirm sexual pleasure and resistance to health help-seeking as men's patriarchal privileges. Our analysis revealed three patterns: looking after the man's libido refers to women's emphasised femininity whereby the man's preference for unprotected sex and reticence to be tested for STIs was accommodated. Negotiating the stronger sex refers to ambivalent femininities, in which participants strategically resist, cooperate and comply with men's sexual health practices. Rejecting the patriarchal double standard that celebrates men as 'studs' and subordinates women as 'sluts' for embodying similar sexual practices reflects protest femininities. Overall, the findings reveal that conventional heterosexual gender relations, in which hegemonic masculinity is accommodated by women who align to emphasised femininity, continues to direct many participants' expectations around men's sexual health and STI testing.

359,"Orisaremi, T. C.

Despite this moderate decrease, the rate for the North-central geopolitical zone: (5.7 and 3.4%, respectively) remained higher than the national average for both years. Besides, virtually all of the HIV and AIDS surveys conducted in Nigeria from 1999 till date have consistently shown higher rates among females than males. For instance, it was 4.0 and 3.5% among females; and 3.5 and 3.3% in males in 2007 and 2012 respectively. UNAIDS reported that studies on the mode of transmission in 2008 found the bulk of new infections among cohabiting and married sexual partners who are not engaged in high risk sex (42.2%) compared to casual heterosexual sex (9.1%) and sex workers (3.4%). Higher vulnerability among married females implies higher risk of parent to child transmission, yet married women are perceived as a âlow riskâ group. Against this backdrop, I studied some gender related socio-cultural factors that influence HIV transmission among married women in two ethnic groups in North-central Nigeria. Results of the qualitative study conducted through 24 in-depth interviews and 36 focus group discussions in six communities indicate that marital consent; womenâs poor access to safe sex; double standards in marital sexual practices; gender based violence against women; among others influence the spread of HIV infection in married heterosexual couples. In conclusion, marriage does not necessarily reduce HIV vulnerability in women. Â© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",0,359

Allen (2016",Making meaning of the virginity experience: young men's perceptions in the United States.,"A qualitative grounded theory approach was used to analyze 34 narratives from young men about their experience of retaining, losing, or giving away their virginity, where 7 said they were virgins, 26 said they were non-virgins, and one did not mention his virginity status. We found that virginity is a multidimensional concept, with two distinct dimensions: the experiential and the developmental. The experiential dimension refers to young men's perception and understanding of their virginity in four overlapping areas: physical, spiritual, relational, and emotional. The developmental dimension refers to young men's perception of their underlying sexual identity growth processes and the gendered and sexual double standards that influence this understanding. Clinical implications of this study are useful in education and counseling. They seek to empower young men with information relating to the multidimensional nature of virginity experience, and minimize the negative effects on romantic relationships, sexual adjustment, and self-identity development. The findings are helpful in designing interventions for young men and women who are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections and can help them negotiate mutually safe and pleasurable experiences regarding their virginity.

Vestel (2005","Ambiguous masculinities, appealing sexualities.","An ethnographic fieldwork was conducted in a working-class district of Oslo during which several young Muslim men of Pakistani origin were interviewed in depth about clothes, music, body, sexuality, love and marriage. Projecting a hyper-macho image, they seem to Â«do manhoodÂ» in a relatively traditional way. On closer inspection, however, the picture is less straight-forward. Their style is influenced by gangsta rap, with expensive clothes, cars and a general macho attitude, but also by House and Techno with their more Â«unisexÂ» and even feminine style elements. Training regimes are associated with body sculpturing, spinning and yoga, with an emphasis on fitness and aesthetic appearance. With regard to sexuality, attitudes seem to reveal what might pass for an old-fashioned double standard, far from the ideals of gender equality generally shared by the ethnic Norwegian majority. For instance, while wishing to marry a virgin from Pakistan, they are themselves sexually active. However, their sexual experiences were described in a self-critical manner, and they emphasised the importance of Â«real loveÂ». The ethnography shows that respondents are often considered sensitive and attractive by ethnic majority girls. Discussing the findings in light of theories of identity, masculinity and sexuality, the authors argue that the masculinities of these young men are challenging in their complex and ambiguous character and resist easy compartmentalization by schemes of so-called hegemonic masculinity. Borrowing a concept coined by Dick Hebdige, the authors approach these masculinities in terms of sociocultural Â«noiseÂ» and conclude that constructions of masculinity encountered in multiethnic and cultural contexts will often display elements of competition and fluidity.

363,"Pitt, E. (1986",Targeting the adolescent male.,"The National Urban League regards too early parenting among adolescents as an issue requiring high level, active attention from all segments of the Black community. Poverty, single parent households and adolescent pregnancies are not exclusively female problems. The role that males play has been missing from too many studies of these phenomena. In light of the fact that most sexual activity is male initiated, and most sexual behavior is male influenced, it becomes clear that there will be no resolution of the problem of teenage pregnancy without directing greater attention to the male. The issue of male resonsibility is skirted too often due to parental pride on the part of mothers and fathers when their male children seek sexual relations with female partners. It is viewed as a sign that they are developing sexually within the norm. This is especially true, in many instances, in female headed households where the mother is concerned that she may not be providing her son with an adequate male role model. Sexual activity by female adolescents, however, is generally not condoned. This confusing double standard is further compounded by the disjointed fashion in which American society responds to adolescent sexuality on the whole. Although the home should be the focal point, many parents reluctantly admit an inability to communicate effectively about sex with their pre-adolescent children. Thus, the school, church, community and social agencies have all been enlisted in this task. The National Urban League's initiative in this area is expected to have significant impact on the course of adolescent sexuality and reproductive responsibility. It centers on the adolescent male and the key role he plays in adolescent pregnancy. One of the top ten Black advertising agencies in New York is working with the Urban League to develop a media campaign that will create in young Black males an awareness of their responsibilities in sexual relations and parenting. The National Urban League is committed to lending ongoing support and efforts at decreasing the incidence of unplanned adolescent pregnancies through education and motivational approaches aimed at all segments of the Black community.

In contrast to the sexual script which holds that women want relationships more than sex and men care about sex more than relationships, students generally accorded women sexual agency and desire in the hookup and validated men's post-hookup relationship interest. However, in explaining the sexless date, students typically reasoned the woman was being chaste and withholding sex to redeem her reputation whereas they often characterized the man's abstinence in terms of a pity date. The findings underscore the tenacity of gendered sexual scripts around heterosexual dates and hookups but also reveal fissures and contradictions that suggest some changes to the sexual double standard.

We examine the production/circulation of gendered value and sexual morality via teens' discussions of activities on Facebook and Blackberry. For instance, some boys accumulated 'ratings' by possessing and exchanging images of girls' breasts, which operated as a form of currency and value. Girls, in contrast, largely discussed the taking, sharing or posting of such images as risky, potentially inciting blame and shame around sexual reputation (e.g. being called 'slut', 'slag' or 'sket').

First, both evolutionary psychology and feminist theory predict that men are largely responsible for suppressing women sexually i.e., male-control theory, whereas SET endorses female control theory. Secondly, women are more invested in sexual exchange than men are. Third, the basis for sexual exchange is that men like sex more than women, but the authors noted that gender differences are shaky when response biases are circumvented.

377,"Soller, B. (2015",Three essays on the cultural context of adolescent romantic relationships and sexual behavior.,"The transition into adolescence brings increased involvement in romantic and sexual relationships for most youth. However, sociologists have only recently begun to examine the developmental consequences of early romantic involvement. And while much research has focused on adolescent sexual intercourse, sex is most often narrowly conceptualized as a form of risk-taking in these studies. While informative, conceptualizing adolescent sexual behavior purely in terms of risk limits the understanding of the wider impact of adolescents' sexual activity on their development and personal well-being. Integrating theoretical insights from perspectives on culture, gender, social networks, and identity, this dissertation examines adolescent romantic relationships and sexual behavior using data from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). I focus on both the dynamics of early romances as well as the mental health consequences of romantic involvement and sexual intercourse among adolescents. First, I consider whether school-based sexual double standards-differing standards of sexual permissiveness among boys and girls-alter the association between sexual intercourse, gender, and adolescent mental health. I measure one particular aspect of the sexual double standard by quantifying within-school differences in boys' and girls' perceptions of the social benefits of sexual intercourse. I find that girls who had sexual intercourse are more likely to report severe depression as the sexual double standard in a school increases. Conversely, boys who engaged in sexual intercourse with one or more non-romantic partners are more likely to report high self-esteem as the sexual double standard increases. Second, I integrate insights from cultural sociology and differential association/social learning theories to explain how cultural and structural features of friendship groups influence adolescent romantic relationship inauthenticity-the extent of incongruence between one's thoughts/feelings and actions within romantic contexts. I use sequence analysis and linear regression to test whether adolescents experience greater romantic relationship inauthenticity when the ordering of events within their ideal romantic relationship scripts (e.g., holding hands, saying ""I love you,"" having sexual intercourse) diverges from sequencing of events within their friends' ideal romantic relationship scripts. I also test whether this association varies according to adolescents' level of interaction with friends and the overall popularity of their friendship groups. Results indicate romantic relationship inauthenticity increases as one's ideal script diverges from the scripts of one's friends. I also find that being attached to popular friends accentuates this association. Finally, integrating insights from cultural sociology and identity theory, I explore the mental health consequences of adolescent romantic relationship inauthenticity by measuring its association with numerous mental health outcomes (e.g., severe depression, suicide ideation, etc.). I find high levels of romantic relationship inauthenticity increase the risk of poor mental health, but only among girls. This dissertation provides novel insights regarding: (1) the importance of culture in determining how sexual activity affects subsequent well-being; (2) how cultural reinforcement and social network processes shape the link between culture and action; and (3) the role gender and culture play in determining how early romantic involvement influences psychological well-being.

Se llevaron a cabo entrevistas exhaustivas con una muestra intercultural de mujeres de Inglaterra y Brasil. Las relaciones sexuales entre mujeres se construyeron discursivamente como ""seguras"" y se consideraba que las mujeres que tienen relaciones sexuales con mujeres corrian un riesgo de bajo a insignificante de contraer o transmitir infecciones de transmision sexual. En el analisis se identificaron dos discursos subyacentes en estas construcciones: un discurso binario que se centraba en las dicotomias de genero, sexualidad y riesgo; y un discurso sexual con un doble rasero, que se centraba en calificar las relaciones sexuales entre mujeres como seguras y el uso de metodos protectivos de barrera como una senal de no participar o disfrutar totalmente del acto sexual.

(2015",A qualitative exploration of young Australian adults' understanding of and explanations for alcohol-involved rape.,"Little is known about the beliefs that underlie the biased attributions that typically characterise people's perceptions of intoxicated sexual perpetrators and their victims. Guided by consensual qualitative research, we explored young Australian adults' (18-25 years; N = 15) attributions for an alcohol-involved rape based on focus groups and interviews. Prominent themes indicated that participants rarely labelled the assault as rape and, instead, adhered to miscommunication explanations. Participants emphasised the developmental value of the victimisation experience although recognising its harmful consequences. Both perpetrator and victim were held strongly responsible based on perceived opportunities to prevent the assault but implicit justifications were, nevertheless, evident. As such, explicit and implicit attributions were contradictory, with the latter reflecting the attributional double standard previously observed in quantitative rape-perception research. Findings underscore the need to challenge pervasive rape myths and equip young adults with knowledge on how to respond supportively to the commonly stigmatised victims of rape.

380,"Storer, H. L., et al. (2019",Context Matters: Factors That Influence African American Teens' Perceptions and Definitions of Dating Violence.,"Objective: African American (AA) teens endure the highest burden of abuse in their romantic relationships. Although teens believe physical violence constitutes abuse (Martin, Houston, Mmari, & Decker, 2012; Sears & Byers, 2010), some teens are more accepting of using controlling behaviors. This study identifies what behaviors AA teens consider to be dating violence, as well as the contextual factors that influence their classification. Method: Data were collected from interviews (n Â± 38) with AA teens in New Orleans. Teens' definitions were elicited through presenting a series of scenarios depicting teen dating violence (TDV) behaviors. Participants were asked to describe their rationales for scenario designation. Researchers employed thematic content analysis to identify primary themes across the interviews. Analysis involved multiple rounds of iterative coding and the clustering of similar thematic constructs. Results: Participants categorized scenarios that contained examples of male-perpetrated physical or sexually coercive acts as ""definitely dating violence."" However, there was more variation in the labeling of other abuse scenarios. Some of the contextual factors that influenced participant designation included the gender and intent of the perpetrator, the impact on the victim, and the role the victim ""played"" in the abuse. Participants had more permissive attitudes regarding acts that were interpreted as typical behaviors in dating relationships. Conclusions: These findings underscore the prominent role contextual factors play in AA teens' understanding of TDV. The narrow distinction between perceptions of seriousness across many of the depicted acts of dating violence reveals the complex processes of defining and measuring TDV.

381,"Sweeney, B. N. (2008","Dangerous and out of control? college men, masculinity, and subjective experiences of sexuality.","Notions of male sexuality as forceful and uncontrollable are central to American culture, and yet we know little about how young men are affected by these cultural beliefs. Quantitative studies of adolescent male sexual behavior have provided us with answers to questions of how much and with whom, but these studies fall short in answering questions of why and, least of all, how did it make you feel. Without investigations into boys' and men's subjective experiences of sexuality, our understanding is incomplete. How do young men feel about and act in response to pressure to commodify sex and to objectify girls and women, and, more generally, to society's conviction that their sexuality is dangerous and out of control? How do they navigate ""post-feminist"" expectations in a world still structured by male power and privilege? Using in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of college men, this dissertation explores young men's subjective experiences of sex, especially as they relate to masculinities, emerging adulthood, and aspects of collegiate culture. More specifically, this dissertation explores how young men differently respond to cultural ideas that frame men's sexuality as strong and demanding and that lead to the objectification and victimization of women. The results show that enacting forms of men's sexuality based on these ideas was difficult and often required a confluence of steadfast personal beliefs about men's and women's sexuality, supportive peer groups, and established social contexts. Some of the men interviewed were guided by discourses that invited them to explore what felt good and exciting, often at the expense of their sexual partners. Other men rejected cultural ideas of men's sexuality that lead to the sexual objectification of women and were more likely to associate their sexual desires with intimate interpersonal relationships. The men's understandings of women's sexuality varied widely but were generally influenced by a strong sexual double standard that condemned women for sexual assertiveness. The dissertation concludes that men's sexuality is highly sensitive to social context and that efforts to address related social problems should educate men about women's sexuality and look beyond individuals to peer cultures and organization and institutional contexts.

(1933",Chastity and the double standard of morals.,"The necessity of self-control and chastity must be impressed upon the mind not only of the young woman but also of the young man. There is not the slightest support in physiology for the double standard of morality of the two sexes. Either men and women should be allowed to lead a promiscuous sex-life, or what is by custom forbidden to the woman should not be allowed to the man either. But such lessons will have very little effect upon boys who have passed childhood and puberty before they have had the opportunity of receiving proper sex-instruction. Such boys need altogether another kind of instruction, namely, lessons in personal prophylaxis. The objection that to teach personal prophylaxis against venereal infection would remove the most effective obstacle to sexual indulgence, i. e., the fear of infection, simply shows the ignorance of the elementary force of the sex instinct. Indulgence in venery, once tasted, drives the boy into the arms of prostitution, fear or no fear. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,382

(1933","Love: A treatise on the science of sex-attraction., Newly revised and enlarged.","Not only among laymen but also among serious thinkers and writers on medical topics the opinion is generally prevalent that there is a vast difference in the degree of intensity of the sex-impulse in men and women. Upon this supposition rests the justification of the double standard of sexual morality of the two sexes. If the intensity of the amatory emotions is the same in both sexes, then there is no justification for a double standard of sexual morality. Now, an emotion is, in its nature, subjective. Its intensity can never be objectively determined. Men and women may dispute the question of the different degree of intensity of the amatory emotions till the end of time, still they will never reach a definite conclusion. The only way to determine the nature of an emotion is to study its pathology. If it can be shown that the same pathological entities of the sex-instinct are found in men and women, the inference is justified that the normal emotions are also the same or similar in both sexes. To prove the similarity or identity of the intensity of the sex-impulse in both sexes, the author published several books dealing with the amatory emotions of men and of women, with the need of proper sexual instruction for children, and the causes of sexual impotence. It occurred to the author that if the amatory emotions are the same in men and women they ought to be treated together in one volume. Hence the present work. But, while the books referred to are the basis for several chapters of ""Love,"" still every author grows with his work. After years of study of the subject of sex, the author was able to expand the sphere of his previous efforts so that readers will find some new points in this book of value and interest. If the reader should agree with this opinion, the author will consider himself well paid for his labors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,383

(2005",Gender double standards in young people attending sexual health services in Northern Thailand.,"Concern about the sexual and reproductive health of young people has been mounting recently in Thailand. Unequal gender relations have a considerable influence on the lives of young people, especially young women, yet few studies have explored the ways in which they have impacted on provision of sexual health care. Drawing upon data from a qualitative study in Northern Thailand, this paper explores the views and experiences of young people in seeking health care, highlighting the kinds of gender double standards and power imbalances that may pose obstacles to their use of sexual and reproductive health services. Findings reveal the vulnerability of sexually active young women in seeking support and care from partners, parents, and service providers. Those who experience adverse outcomes of sexual activity, such as unwanted pregnancy or infection, report facing indifference, victim blaming, or the threat of abandonment by their partners. Because of their fear of disclosure to their parents and communities, of their sexual activity, they opt for clandestine and unsafe abortion and seek the counsel of peers and drugstores rather than parents and providers. At the service provider level, young women report facing threatening and judgemental attitudes, indifferent counselling, and possible violation of confidentiality. This is in marked contrast to the treatment of young men, who generally meet with a more sympathetic and accepting response. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,384

Focus groups were conducted with 64 sexually active adolescent girls ages 14 to 17 years. General coding and content analyses identified patterns, themes, and salient beliefs. More than one third (37.5%) reported having experienced physical, intimate partner violence; 32.8% had two or more recent sex partners, and 37.5% had ever had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or HIV. Although some girls in abusive relationships feared retribution if they had more than one partner, others sought additional partners for solace or as an act of resistance. Adolescent HIV/STI prevention programs need to address the influence of gender norms such as the sexual double standard, as well as partner pressure and partner abuse on adolescent decision-making about safer sex, and also promote healthy relationships as integral to advancing HIV/STI risk reduction.

Intimate relationships and sexuality have entered the public domain and are presented on the screen, offering audiences possible roles to play in reality. Trepidation of teenagers being 'corrupted' by sexualised media has urged many scholars to investigate this issue. However, sexualised, mediatised representations can also empower and emancipate teens who are often savvy, active and critical media consumers. We aim to study how young audiences (aged 14-19) in Flanders consume fictional sexual scripts, and how these scripts can help in the development and articulation of sexual identity. A qualitative approach was taken using 57 teenagers divided into eight, in-depth focus groups. Sexual norms and values, as well as the sexual double standard and sexual scripts were discussed. Talking about and watching televised sex has become less of a taboo among teens, but this does not imply their permissiveness is unlimited. Traditional norms and values regarding relationships and sexuality are still highly valued, and although most respondents are tolerant towards casual sex by others, they distance themselves from such behaviour.

This article examines links between gender ideology or gender roles and the social impact of adolescent childbearing in the lives of rural and urban adolescents in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. It employs a triangulated research methodology (focus-group discussions, narrative role playing and discussions, and questionnaires and in-depth interviews) to inform an analysis of adolescents' notions of male and female gender ideals. This analysis forms the basis for an exploration of the potential influence of adolescent childbearing on young peoples' lives and factors that shape their sexual and reproductive well-being. Results indicate that gender ideals are grounded in traits that reinforce poor sexual negotiation dynamics and behavioral double standards and that place adolescents at risk for early pregnancy and other sexual and reproductive health complications. Overall, adolescent parenthood is viewed negatively by participants of both sexes because it compromises personal, professional, and financial aspirations.

(2018",Adolescent romance: a sociological analysis of the politics of young people’s sexuality and relationships.,"The sociological study of adolescent romance began with cultural studies in the 1970s. However, it was not a consolidated line of research until the 1990s, when love and sexuality became a topic of interest for the study of adolescent romance in the field of sociology. This article investigates adolescent romance in the framework of these theoretical contributions, which define it as a social and cultural space consisting of the following dimensions: the culture of class, gender and ethnicity, friendship groups, sexual attraction, sexual practices, and affective practices and couple formation. Within this framework, the objective of this paper is to analyse the dimensions that define adolescent romance in order to identify the models of masculinity and femininity present in it. Based on this analysis, the type of relationship established in terms of power and (in)equality is studied. The data were drawn from two case studies carried out in the city of Granada (Andalusia, Spain). The data show the tendency of boys toward hegemonic or virile masculinity, while girls tend to embrace romantic love. Drawing on this analysis, the paper concludes that a gendered double standard persists where masculinity and femininity are complementary in adolescent romance following a patriarchal logic that hinders the formation of democratic, egalitarian relationships based on mutual respect.

Negative aspects of FWBRs included getting hurt, ruining the friendship, and the relationship becoming complicated or awkward. FWBRs were characterized by limited direct communication between partners. Participants perceived little or no risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) within their FWBRs although 44% reported having additional sexual partners during their most recent FWBR and a third reported inconsistent or no condom use, A majority (77%) of the participants believed that a sexual double standard exists in which women are judged more negatively than men for participating in FWBRs.

390,"Wight, D., et al. (2006",Contradictory sexual norms and expectations for young people in rural Northern Tanzania.,"There has been a long-running debate as to whether sexual cultures in sub-Saharan Africa are permissive or characterised by restrictive rules, rituals and self-restraint. This paper, based on participant observation data, outlines the main features of sexual culture in rural northern Tanzania and highlights both permissive and restrictive norms and expectations for young people. It also illustrates how sexual beliefs are socially constructed and subject to social change. Sexual activity is constrained by clear norms of school pupil abstinence, female sexual respectability and taboos around the discussion of sex. However, these norms are incompatible with several widely held expectations: that sexual activity is inevitable unless prevented, sex is a female resource to be exploited, restrictions on sexual activity are relaxed at festivals, and masculine esteem is boosted through sexual experience. Differential commitment to these norms and expectations reflects conflicts between generations and genders. Young people appear to manage the contradictions in these norms by concealing their sexual relationships. This almost certainly contributes to their short duration and the high levels of partner change, since relationships are not reinforced through social recognition and there is little scope to develop intimacy through non-sexual contacts.

Thirty patients (15 males, 15 females, mean age 73.93 Â± 12.72 years) with NIDDM in good glycemic control were compared with thirty non-diabetic elderly, well matched for sex and age (15 males, 15 females, mean age 74.3 Â± 4.24 years), and with ten young normal subjects (5 males, 5 females, mean age 26.3 Â± 1.56 years). In these subjects, the range of motion (ROM) of ankle, knee, hip, elbow and shoulder were measured with a double-armed goniometer. Moreover, abnormalities of supraspinatus, patellar and Achilles tendons were evaluated with a standardized ultrasound (US) procedure. A significant reduction in the mobility of all joints was found in elderly subjects, compared to younger ones, with exception for the knee and elbow flexion. Elderly patients with diabetes, compared with their age-matched counterpart, showed LJM for ankle dorso- and plantar flexion, hip flexion and adduction, shoulder abduction and flexion. Moreover, tendons sonographic abnormalities were more frequently observed in diabetics.

New Zealand has a permissive ICT curriculum, comprising a variety of subjects and characterised by choice and variation in the curriculum in practice at the local level. The data that are reported include results of (i) a national questionnaire survey of secondary schools, and (ii) a qualitative case study conducted in a large, co-educational New Zealand secondary school and involving classroom observations and interviews with teachers and students. It is suggested that the permissiveness of the curriculum, which ostensibly caters for the needs of students by providing choices, may, in some circumstances, effectively reinforce gender stereotypes relating to computer interests and practices. This is a paradox of choice. Questions are raised about the nature of the ICT curriculum in New Zealand and how it may contribute to or challenge gender stereotypes, future curriculum developments and, more broadly, how we can account for persistent gendered participation patterns in ICT subjects in schools.

398,"Adams, W. H. (2018",Estimating the prevalence of Hepatitis C in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"Hepatitis C (HCV) is a virus transmitted via contact with contaminated products such as razor-blades or by engaging in high-risk activities (i.e., such as sexual or injecting drug-use activities). Today, there are an estimated 115 million people world-wide living with HCV. Despite recent advancements in antiviral treatments that can ameliorate (or even cure) HCV, treatment remains laborious and costly and is often unavailable in resource-poor areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The primary aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of HCV in SSA. A meta-analysis was conducted on the HCV epidemic in SSA. A literature search for evidence of HCV in SSA was conducted and was limited to articles, abstracts, and conference proceedings published in English, Spanish, or French from January 2000 through December 2013. Linear and generalized-linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the pooled prevalence of HCV in SSA as a function of the population at-risk, region of SSA, year of publication, and the assay used to detect viremia. In these models, the estimates were weighted by their inverse variance and pooled separately using no transformation, a canonical logit transformation, and double-arcsine transformation. These three transformation approaches were compared on precision, model fit, and publication bias. The overall pooled prevalence estimate of HCV in SSA ranged from 3.80% to 5.83% depending on the transformation used. For all three methods, however, prevalence of HCV varied among those at-risk for infection (p < .001) and by region of SSA (p < .001). In fact, the prevalence of HCV among those at-risk for infection depended on region of SSA (p < .001). Conversely, this study was unable to show that prevalence depends on publication year (p > .05) or diagnostic assay (p > .05) under all three transformation methods. Regarding the optimal transformation, prevalence of HCV in SSA tended to be lowest when estimated under a canonical logit transformation and highest when estimated using no transformation of the raw effect sizes. Regarding precision and model fit, confidence intervals for all prevalence estimates were severely overlapping under the three transformation methods, yet normality, linearity, and residual plots consistently revealed that the canonical logit approach was superior when compared to the double-arcsine transformation and raw estimation method. When estimating the pooled prevalence of HCV in SSA, this study did not identify meaningful differences between the logit and double-arcsine transformations. That is, they were generally comparable in precision and had severely overlapping confidence intervals for all moderator analyses. However, model fit statistics suggest that the canonical logit approach provided a better fit to the data than the double-arcsine transformation or raw estimation method. I caution future researchers considering no transformation of the raw prevalence estimates. When no transformation was used, the pooled prevalence estimate of HCV in SSA was inflated as measured by standardized residuals, individual study variances were severely attenuated, publication bias estimates were quite severe and, in some instances, the study predicted prevalence estimates well below zero. For this reason, I recommend using the canonical logit transformation for meta-analyses of HCV in Sub-Saharan Africa. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,398

This study was designed to assess the role of family function and parental influence on sexual behavior of in-school youths in secondary schools in a sub-urban area of Southwest Nigeria. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among secondary school students using semi-structured interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Information was obtained on the sexual behavior and parent-child characteristics. Family functionality was assessed using family APGAR standardized instrument. Association was established using chi2-test for qualitative variables and t-test for quantitative variables at p = 0.05. Results: Mean age of respondents was 14.8 +/- 2.2 years. Majority were from monogamous family setting (70.7%) and lived with their families (75.6%). About a quarter (26.8%) was from dysfunctional families and 9.2% had ever had sexual intercourse. Recent sexual engagement in the preceding 1 month was reported (47.4%). The mean score for parental monitoring, father-child communication, mother-child communication, and parental disapproval of sex were 10.4 +/- 2.2, 9.3 +/- 2.3, 9.8 +/- 2.4, and 10.4 +/- 2.3, respectively.

Methods: Data from a representative probability sample of 5534 women aged 13-20 years was analyzed. The instrument included questions on sexual initiation, condom use during first sex, religious affiliation, and sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. Statistical tests were performed at the bivariate and multivariate levels. Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression were used at the multivariate levels. Standard errors were adjusted for the ""clustering"" effect found in data from multistage cluster samples. Results: Affiliation with religious groups that excommunicate members for engaging in premarital sex, and that oppose condom use has both positive and negative effects on behaviors that carry the risk of HIV infection; young women affiliated with conservative groups are more likely to delay sexual initiation but less likely to use condoms during first sex. Conclusions: Denominations that are not only strongly opposed to premarital sex and condom use, but are able to exercise control over adolescents through socialization or the threat of social exclusion, are likely to create conflicting behaviors among adolescents that cancel each other in terms of HIV risk. Overall, these findings suggest that affiliation with conservative religious groups is unlikely to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Additional studies are recommended.

(2004",A single administration of testosterone improves visuospatial ability in young women.,"Previous research has documented correlations between endogenous testosterone levels and visuospatial cognitive function. Some causal relations have also been established in treatment designs in which testosterone was administered to elderly subjects for a number of weeks. Particularly, one study reported a selective effect of a single administration of testosterone on some aspects of spatial memory in 15 women. The present study tested the hypothesis whether a single administration of 0.5 mg of sublingual testosterone would improve visuospatial ability in healthy young women on a test that has consistently been associated with male superiority. Twenty-six women participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial of single administration of testosterone and placebo. Subjects were tested in the same phase of the menstrual-cycle. Four to five hours after both administrations, subjects completed a standardized measure of visuospatial ability (3-D Mental Rotations Test). Visuospatial ability improved significantly after testosterone administration compared to placebo, after controlling for learning effects due to repeated testing. Testosterone is suggested to be causally related to visuospatial ability in young women. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,402
403,"Alrajhi, M. and S. Aldhafri (2015",Academic and social self-concept: Effects of teaching styles and gender in English as a foreign language setting.,"This study examined the relationship between academic and social self-concept and teachers' teaching styles (authoritative, authoritarian and permissive). The participants included 511 school students (53.2% females). They completed the Self-Definition Questionnaire (SDQ-I) and the Teacher Authority Questionnaire. Data were analysed to predict self-concept from teaching styles. On the one hand, females' academic self-concept was positively predicted by authoritative and permissive teaching. However, their social self-concept was only predicted by permissive teaching. On the other hand, males' academic and social self-concepts were not predicted by any of the teaching styles. Teaching styles seem to support learning self-concept in female students more strongly than in male students. The findings contribute to social cognitive theories when applied to cross-cultural settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,403
404,"Alzate, H. (1984",Sexual behavior of unmarried Colombian University students: A five-year follow-up.,"Surveyed the sexual behavior of 165 male (mean age 22.7 yrs) and 149 female (mean age 23.1 yrs) students of a Colombian university and compared the results with those obtained approximately 5 yrs earlier by H. Alzate (1977; see also PA, Vol 61:927). For the latter survey, 26 questionnaires from married females less than 30 yrs of age were also analyzed for comparisons with unmarried females. All Ss were baptized Catholics; 70.7% of the males and 60.4% of the females professed to be either scantily religious or religiously inactive, while the remaining Ss reported that they were moderately or devoutly religious. On the whole, 5-yr findings corroborate the earlier data. Coital incidences of 93.9% among males and 38.3% among females, as well as the important role that prostitution still played in the sexual lives of males, show that the double standard is still prevalent. However, there are indicators of its erosion, such as males decreasing reliance on prostitutes as sources of sexual outlet and the appreciable incidence of female premarital coitus. Another change was the great decrease in the incidence of venereal diseases among males since the earlier survey. No significant differences were found between more- and less-religious Ss or between married and unmarried females. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,404

406,"Amico, K. R., et al. (2012",Supporting study product use and accuracy in self-report in the iprex study: Next step counseling and neutral assessment.,"The recent successes of biomedical HIV prevention approaches have sparked considerable debate over the scalability, feasibility, and acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a widespread prevention strategy for men who have sex with men and trans-gender. Anticipated difficulties with PrEP adherence and concerns about resources required to best support it have tempered enthusiasm of PrEP demonstration projects and roll-out. While no evidence-based approach for supporting PrEP use is presently available, a number of approaches have been developed in the context of double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trials of PrEP that can provide guidance in moving forward with real world support of open label PrEP use. We present the development, implementation and evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of next-step counseling (NSC) and neutral assessment (NA), the adherence support and promotion of accurate reporting approaches used in the late phases of the iPrEx study. Evaluation of the approach from the perspective of implementers of over 15,000 NSC sessions in seven different countries with almost 2,000 iPrEx participants provided support for NSC, its brevity (averaging *14 min per follow-up session) and overall acceptability and feasibility. NA also was generally well supported, with a majority of study staff believing this approach was feasible and acceptable; however, lower acceptability for certain aspects of NA was noted amongst staff reporting NA was different from their previous interview approach. Quantitative and qualitative data gathered from implementers were used to make modifications for supporting PrEP use in the open-label extension of iPrEx.

407,"Anderson, M. L. (2009",,"The films made this year and the performers who starred in them participated in a relatively new popular interest in the secret strangeness of the familiar personality. The stories the movies now told bore the traces of a significant cultural transition: from a Progressive Era concern with finding happiness through solving life's problems to a new but sustained fascination with the experiences and fate of the unusual person. For some, this development marks the transition from a socially conscious cinema to one of mere entertainment, but it also announces the arrival of the contemporary media personality, one of the principal categories through which we now experience the world. Several films released during the year-Enchantment, Footlights, Her Face Value, Hickville to Broadway, Reputation, A Small Town Idol-dealt both seriously and humorously with the complicated lives of fictionalized popular performers. This new fascination with celebrity differed from the traditional admiration of historically significant individuals such as great artists, thinkers, and statesmen. Instead, the new personality was more likely to be any ordinary individual who had, because of some peculiar personal characteristic or particular circumstance, arbitrarily entered upon the world stage. In September, Margaret Gorman, a ""Mary Pickford look-a-like"" and the newly crowned Miss Washington, D.C., won the first intercity beauty pageant held on the boardwalks of Atlantic City (Allen 80; ""1,000 Bathing Girls""). Apparently, a relatively ordinary individual could now achieve unprecedented renown overnight, solely through the possession of some unusual quality or through involvement in some sensational event. Sales of musical records peaked at a level the recording industry would not see again until World War II. While radio and sound movies would eventually become the principal mechanisms for the promotion of popular songs, phonograph records and sheet music remained important components of a mass culture devoted to the promulgation of personalities. Songwriters James F. Hanley and Grant Clarke witnessed the composition they penned for the Ziegfeld Follies become a national sensation, but the appeal of ""Second Hand Rose"" was inextricably tied to its performer, Fanny Brice, who sang the song at the Follies during the summer. Brice had become a star attraction because of her comedic turns at musical parody and her performance of ""ethnic"" numbers. Unlike other Jewish performers, Brice exploited her working-class origins by travestying high cultural forms of dance and by singing mock romantic songs in Yiddish dialect. As theater historian Linda Mizejewski points out, Brice's identity not only contrasted with ""the outrageous fabrication"" (8) of whiteness and Anglo-ancestry of the typical Glorified American Girl on display in the Follies, but also ""situated [her] in the ambiguous intersection of stardom and contempt"" (133). Yet as Brice was saving the seemingly indistinguishable bevy of Ziegfeld beauties from conformity to a single standard of American feminine desirability, she also created a popular appeal for her own difference. If public interest in Brice sometimes took the form of ridicule, it also often constituted a cultural appreciation of the comedienne as a compelling figure whose biography and art could provide valuable insight into contemporary life. ""Second Hand Rose"" was received as a biographical gloss on Brice's own impoverished upbringing, and with her ability to inject heartfelt pathos into the most comic of songs, the public easily recognized the emotional costs of the struggle to keep up appearances in an increasingly consumerist society: ""Second hand pearls I'm wearing second hand curls / I never get a single thing that's new / Even Jake the plumber, he's the man I adore / Had the nerve to tell me he's been married before / Ev'ry one knows that I'm just second hand Rose / From Second Avenue.""1 Second Avenue was the center of the Jewish theatrical district and was known during the early decades of the century as ""Jewish Broadway."" Here, the song's very connection to Brice's own background opens upon a series of contemporary issues including fashion systems, premarital sex, divorce, class mobility, and the difficulties of ethnic assimilation, making Brice herself a salient interpreter of contemporary America society. The real success of the song's appeal, however, is its insistence on inevitable failure. By claiming that ""Ev'ry one knows"" the real identity of Rose, the song describes the public's own involvement in the construction and deconstruction of modern personalities whose glamorized surfaces were valued precisely because they lead into new processes of discovery. Another source for promoting popular personalities were the nation's 2,335 daily newspapers, with an aggregate circulation of over thirty million (Park 64). The newly elected president, Warren G. Harding, had come to politics as a successful newspaper publisher from Marion, Ohio. Harding had exploited the media's new interest in the private lives of public figures by campaigning from the front porch of his home in Marion in the 1920 race. Newspapers and newsreels had given his campaign extensive coverage and free publicity, especially when Mr. and Mrs. Harding were visited by well-known stage and screen personalities such as Al Jolson, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Texas Guinan, Conway Tearle, or Photoplay editor James R. Quirk (""Actors to Go to Marion""). The Republicans came to power on a platform of isolationism, probusiness policies, and anti-radicalism. If postwar society was to be remade, it was going to be remade as a fully ""American"" society. The Republicans promoted a vast platform of Americanization, seeking to assure that traditional cultural values and social relations would be preserved as big business expanded and the new consumer economy flourished. The ideology of Americanization found support within white supremacist organizations, as well as providing much of the rationalization for anti-immigrant policies such as the Emergency Quota Act, passed by the Congress in May to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the United States according to ethnicity and race. Membership in the Ku Klux Klan was at an all-time high, and the newspapers provided the country with seemingly daily coverage of the Klan's vigilante violence, not only in the South, but also in New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. A race riot in Tulsa, Oklahoma, left an inestimable number of black citizens murdered with impunity. During the summer, the national press turned its attention to the controversial trial in Boston of two Italian anarchists charged with murdering a pair of retail clerks during a payroll robbery. Their widely contested conviction this year, their subsequent appeals, and their eventual execution in 1927 made Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti emblematic of the anti-radical xenophobia often imputed to the decade. While Hollywood steadfastly avoided the topics of racial inequality, segregation, or lynching, the white-owned and independent Reol Corporation released as many as six black-cast race features, with The Burden of Race going so far as to promote the legitimacy of miscegenation, which was still outlawed in the majority of states. In both The Land of Hope and Puppets of Fate, the majors did, however, attempt to deal sensitively with the plight of European immigrants. The Great War also remained an important event for dramatizing international relations, as in Frances Marion's The Love Light and Rex Ingram's The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The cinematic rumination on modern marriage begun by Cecil B. DeMille continued with comedies such as George Marshall's Why Trust Your Husband?, melodramas such as Lois Weber's What Do Men Want? and Too Wise Wives, and DeMille's own The Affairs of Anatol. Wallace Reid contributed to his popular series of automobile racing films with Too Much Speed, but was joined by daredevil Bebe Daniels in The Speed Girl and even by cowboy Tom Mix in The Road Demon. One of the most highly praised and successful films of the year was a bucolic oming-of-age story filmed in rural Virginia. As a refreshing alternative to Hollywood's obsession with sex and the city, Henry King's Tol'able David apparently played well in heartland theaters because of its nostalgic celebration of old-time rural values; the film did just as well, however, in urban centers, mostly due to twenty-six-year-old Richard Barthelmess's endearing portrayal of the adolescent title character.

408,"Andersson, G. (1995",Divorce-risk trends in Sweden 1971-1993.,"The purpose of this paper is to introduce an updated system of annual indexes of divorce risks and to use the system to display trends in divorce risks for Swedish women over the years since 1971. Divorce-risk trends turn out to have been quite different for women at different parities. Trends for women in their first marriage (the majority) are also somewhat different from trends in later marriages. After a spurt in divorces at parity 0 connected with a divorce reform in 1974, divorce risks have been quite stable for women at this parity, but they have increased steadily among married mothers, mostly as an effect of an increasing prevalence of premarital childbearing. Our indexes are produced by an indirect standardization of register data with respect to women's age at marriage, duration of marriage, and order of marriage. We also recommend standardization with respect to an indicator of premarital childbearing, which is particularly important in a population with extensive nonmarital cohabitation.

409,"Andrews, D. (2007",Softcore as Serialized (and Feminized) Featurette: Postfeminist Propriety on Late-Night Cable.,"The softcore serial (or âsoftcore featuretteâ) is a prolific sexploitation subgenre spawned by the early-nineties popularity of Red Shoe Diaries, Zalman King's late-night Showtime program. Like Red Shoe Diaries, the softcore serial is an elaborately feminized and aspirational form with a pointedly âpostfeministâ sensibility. Though this subgenre is also a self-consciously apolitical form structured by double standards and essentialist stereotypes, contemporary feminists have nevertheless been increasingly inclined to condone it, a trend that may dovetail with a larger postfeminist receptiveness to traditional ideas of femininity. This article proposes that the softcore serial and its (post)feminist reception are most usefully framed as the product of three overlapping cultural contexts: the histories of postfeminist cultural production, of American sexploitation cinema, and of premium cable programming.

(2008","Divalproex extended-release in adolescent migraine prophylaxis: Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 3 different doses of divalproex sodium extended-release vs placebo in the prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adolescents. Background: Divalproex sodium has been approved for migraine prophylaxis in adults, and previous uncontrolled data suggest divalproex sodium may be effective in preventing migraine in children and adolescents with acceptable tolerability. Methods: This was a 12-week, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study in approximately 300 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with migraine headaches. At the end of the baseline phase, subjects still meeting study criteria were randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive divalproex sodium extended-release 250 mg, 500 mg, or 1000 mg once daily, or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was reduction from baseline in 4-week migraine headache rate for each active treatment group vs placebo. Standard safety assessments were conducted and testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were collected for postmenarchal females. Results: There was no statistically significant treatment difference between any divalproex sodium extended-release dose group and placebo for the primary efficacy variable, reduction from baseline in 4-week migraine headache rate. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between any active treatment group and placebo. A notable dose-related decrease in platelets was observed, and individuals in all 4 treatment groups had increases in ammonia levels; treatment differences in other laboratory variables were generally small. Among postmenarchal female subjects who were not taking hormonal contraceptives or other steroids, there was no statistically significant change in testosterone levels, but a statistically significant dose-related increase in sex hormone-binding globulin was observed. Conclusions: In the current study, divalproex sodium extended-release did not differentiate from placebo in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches but was generally well-tolerated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

411,"Arakawa, D. R., et al. (2013",Positive psychology: What impact has it had on sex research publication trends?,"Throughout history, Americans have been bitterly divided as to whether passionate love and sexual desire are positive experiences (that give meaning to life), whether they constitute a political, social, and spiritual danger, or whether sex in itself is not inherently bad, but certain sexual behaviors are wrong or dangerous. As previously noted by H. L. Horowitz, R. L. Rapson, and L. Stone, political and religious authorities-preaching the virtues of social control, chastity, and circumspection- have prevailed over reformers advocating ""free love,"" gender equality, birth control, the elimination of the double standard, sex education, and the like. In this paper we ask: Do we see any bias in the publication of modern-day sexuality research-specifically, do published studies tend to focus primarily on the positive or the negative aspects of sexuality? We attempted to answer this question by conducting a content analysis of articles appearing in four prestigious journals: The Journal of Sex Research, Archives of Sexual Behavior, The New England Journal of Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, from 1960 to the present. As expected, only a slim minority of articles investigated the delights of love, sex, and intimacy; the vast majority focused on the problems associated with sexual behavior. The positive psychology movement does not appear to have altered this time-tested bias. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,411

Using multilevel analyses to examine data from 1,301 workers (including 262 women employed in 58 work units in the manufacturing, service and construction sectors), our findings indicate that, even when controlling for a variety of other demographic and unit-level factors, there is a significant association between the proportion of males in a work unit identified as being heavy or ""at-risk"" drinkers and the probability of gender harassment toward unit females.

While more traditional direct approaches will remain the standard for instructors, the integration of paradoxical techniques into adventure-based education to overcome anticipated or actual resistance can enhance effectiveness. Assumptions underlying paradoxical learning contradict the medical model with its deterministic nature of genes and biochemistry by suggesting that human growth and learning can determine behavior.

(2015",Intimate insight: MDMA changes how people talk about significant others.,"Rationale: +/- 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely believed to increase sociability. The drug alters speech production and fluency, and may influence speech content. Here, we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content, which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions. Method: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers. Results: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content, specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction. Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states, and on emotional and psychosocial interaction.

Methods: Twenty-two (11 for the PSG) healthy young volunteers of both sexes with no history of sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index <5) participated in a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, repeated-dose, 4-period, cross-over study. All volunteers received all 4 treatment sequences: paroxetine-alprazolam placebo (PAP); paroxetine placebo-alprazolam (PPA); paroxetine-alprazolam (PA), and paroxetine placebo-alprazolam placebo (PLA), in a randomized order. Each treatment was administered over 15 consecutive days, with a treatment-free interval of 7 days prior to the subsequent study period. In each experimental period, one PSG sleep study was performed on the 1st night (single-dose effects) and another study was performed on the 15th night (repeated-dose effects). Additionally, two other PSG studies were assessed: an adaptation recording, and a control night recording. All-night PSG recordings were obtained following standard procedures. Each 30-second period was scored according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales by means of an automatic sleep analysis system: Somnolyzer 24x7â¢. A self-rating scale for sleep and awakening quality and early morning behavior was completed no later than 15 min after awakening over the 15 days of each experimental intervention. General lineal models (treatment/time) were applied separately to each variable. Results: (1) No significant effects were observed in any sleep variables when control nights were compared with the 1st night with PLA. (2) Sleep continuity: After PAP a clear awakening effect was seen both in the first and second evaluations, mainly in wake time, movement time, number of awakenings and stage-1 duration. After PPA an evident hypnotic effect was observed on night 1. This effect was mainly observed in maintenance variables and slightly in sleep initiation variables; it had decreased by night 15. After PA an intermediate behavior in the variables related to sleep continuity was seen, highlighting the absence of the tolerance phenomenon observed when PPA was administered alone. (3) Sleep architecture: The most important effects in REM sleep were observed after PAP; an increase in REM latency and decreases in REM sleep. PAP also induced decreases in the number of non-REM and REM periods and increases in the average duration of non-REM periods and sleep cycles. PA presented a similar pattern to PAP, and PPA similar to PLA. In relation to non-REM sleep, PA showed more stage-2 and less slow-wave sleep (SWS). (4) Subjective perception: No significant differences were observed between treatments while they were being taken, but impairments in subjective sleep quality, awaking quality, latency and efficiency were seen, mainly after PA but also after PPA discontinuations. Conclusion: The combination of PAP and PPA presented an intermediate pattern in relation to sleep continuity, with less awaking effect than PAP alone and less hypnotic effect than PPA alone, and without developing tolerance. The PAP and PPA combination also showed a similar effect to PAP on REM sleep and was the treatment with the longest stage 2 and shortest SWS. No subjective sleep and awakening effects were seen during drug intake but subjective withdrawal reports were seen after abrupt interruption. The high agreement rate for the epoch-by-epoch comparison between automatic and human scoring confirms the validity of the Somnolyzer 24x7 and thus facilitates sleep studies in neuropsychopharmacological research.

(2004","Central and peripheral evaluation of rupatadine, a new antihistamine/ platelet-activating factor antagonist, at different doses in healthy volunteers.","Aims: To assess peripheral anti-H1 and central nervous system (CNS) activity of single increasing doses of rupatidine fumarate (RU), a new antihistamine/platelet-activating factor antagonist compound, in comparison with hydroxyzine and placebo. Methods: Eighteen healthy young subjects of both sexes took part in a crossover, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Treatments tested were: RU 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg and hydroxyzine 25 mg, as a positive standard. Before and several times after drug intake, peripheral anti-H1 activity was appraised by the skin reactivity to intradermal injection of histamine. CNS effects were also obtained by objective tests of psychomotor performance and subjective mood scales. Results: All active treatments showed a significant reduction of the wheal and flare reaction in relation to placebo, RU displaying a potent dose-dependent inhibition pattern. The global nonparametric Friedman test to changes from placebo in 15 objective variables from psychomotor performance showed a significant impairment of similar magnitude after hydroxyzine 25 mg (p = 0.01) and RU 80 mg (p = 0.02), but this was slower in development and recovery after the latter. After RU 40 mg, a smaller impairment was also obtained (p = 0.04). Activity (p = 0.01) and drowsiness (p = 0.02) scales showed significant changes, the subjects feeling less active and more drowsy after all active treatments. Conclusion: RU presents a potent dose-dependent peripheral anti-H1 activity, displaying psychomotor impairment activity only at the highest dose (80 mg), while therapeutically relevant lower doses (10 and 20 mg) were similar to placebo.

423,"Barber, S., et al. (2016",Double-jeopardy: The joint impact of neighborhood disadvantage and low social cohesion on cumulative risk of disease among African American men and women in the Jackson Heart Study.,"Objectives: Few studies have examined the joint impact of neighborhood disadvantage and low social cohesion on health. Moreover, no study has considered the joint impact of these factors on a cumulative disease risk profile among a large sample of African American adults. Using data from the Jackson Heart Study, we examined the extent to which social cohesion modifies the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and cumulative biological risk (CBR)-measure of accumulated risk across multiple physiological systems. Methods: Our analysis included 4408 African American women and men ages 21-85 residing in the Jackson, MS Metropolitan Area. We measured neighborhood disadvantage using a composite score of socioeconomic indicators from the 2000 US Census and social cohesion was assessed using a 5-item validated scale. Standardized z-scores of biomarkers representing cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroendocrine systems were combined to create a CBR score. We used two-level linear regression models with random intercepts adjusting for socio-demographic and behavioral covariates in the analysis. A three-way interaction term was included to examine whether the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and CBR differed by levels of social cohesion and gender. Results: The interaction between neighborhood disadvantage, social cohesion and gender was statistically significant (p = 0.05) such that the association between living in a disadvantaged neighborhood and CBR was strongest for men living in neighborhoods with low levels of social cohesion (B = 0.63, SE: 0.32). In gender-specific models, we found a statistically significant interaction between neighborhood disadvantage and social cohesion for men (p = 0.05) but not for women (p = 0.50). Conclusion: Neighborhoods characterized by high levels of economic disadvantage and low levels of social cohesion contribute to higher cumulative risk of disease among African American men. This suggests that they may face a unique set of challenges that put them at greater risk in these settings. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",0,423
424,"Bass, C., et al. (1987",Does atenolol improve physical and psychological function after coronary artery bypass surgery: A controlled study.,"A double-blind prospective randomized trial of atenolol (100 mg once daily) was carried out on 88 patients (78 men) awaiting coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Standardized ratings of both psychiatric morbidity and functional capacity were made before, 3 months (n = 82) and 12 months (n = 81) after surgery. One year after surgery men in the atenolol group had a significantly shorter treadmill exercise time than those on placebo (7.21 Â± 0.28 min vs 8.32 Â± 0.40 min; p < 0.05), but the frequency of reported anginal attacks during the year was similar in both drug groups. Improvement in functional capacity (measured in exercise time) in the 71 men following surgery was related to both physical and psychological variables assessed before the operation. Men with more severe occlusive disease, lower neuroticism and higher extraversion scores pre-operatively showed greater percentage improvement in exercise time after surgery. Women had significantly higher levels of psychiatric morbidity and shorter treadmill exercise time than men both before and after surgery. Of the psychiatric and psychological variables, only ratings of Type A behaviour fell significantly in the atenolol group (170.9 Â± 5.3 vs 163.0 Â± 5.2; p < 0.05). This change, which is probably not clinically important, occurred independently of any reduction in either overall psychiatric morbidity score or ratings of somatic symptoms mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. The atenolol group reported more side-effects of both psychological and physical symptoms than the placebo group. We do not recommend the routine use of atenolol after bypass graft surgery. Our findings failed to support the suggestion that Type A characteristics may reflect an underlying sympathetic nervous system reactivity. Â© 1987.",0,424

426,"Bazarbaeva, S. M., et al. (2017",Comparative physical health evaluation of Kazakh and Russian first year undergraduate students.,"Introduction. The study of ethnonational features of organism morphological and functional development in the process of adaptation to social and environmental conditions is one of the rapidly developing areas of ecological physiology. In this aspect, the goal of this paper is to assess physical health and morphological and functional parameters of Kazakh first-year students of North Kazakhstan State University named after M. Kozybaev (NKSU) and compare the results with similar data of Russian peers - students of Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University (NSPU), living in a similar climatic and geographical area. Materials and Methods. 200 17-18-year-old first-year students of both sexes, studying in different faculties of NKSU (100 females and 100 males) and 1,000 students of NSPU (833 females and 167males) were involved in this study. The standard conventional methods of identifying morphological and functional parameters were used. The obtained data were processed by methods of variation and difference statistics. Results. It was shown that the parameters of physical development (height, weight, chest circum-ference, indexes Ketle, Pin'e and rises) of first-year students were within the age, sex, and regional standards, but the comparative assessment of physical health of the Kazakh and Russian first-year students showed significant differences in some anthropometric and physiological parameters. For example, Kazakh students of both sexes have lower height, but young males have higher body weight. Kazakh students have higher functional parameters such as carpal index, double product, effectiveness of blood circulation index, but lower vital lung volume and life index, which indicated the well-muscled, large functional ability of the heart, but weak capabilities of the respiratory system as compared to Russian peers. Conclusions. The findings allow to conclude that a higher percentage of Kazakh first-year students have the level of physical health at the average and higher-average levels, while Russian counter-parts demonstrate the average and below-average levels of health. The findings have revealed the need to continue studying the influence of ethno-national and environmental factors on students' health, as well as medical-pedagogical correction of educational process.

(2014","A quantitative exploration of attitudes out of line with the prevailing norms toward alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use among European students.","The study examines groups of 15-16-year-old students whose attitudes toward drug use are out of line with the prevailing norms. It analyzes data from eight countries from the 2003 European School Survey on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD): Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Malta, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In those countries, 22,900 15-16-year-old pupils answered the ESPAD questionnaire. Groups of subjects whose responses are far removed from the modal value are sought and studied. The aim is to explore ""rare answers"" compared to what is perceived by the majority of students. In order to explore what can lead a pupil to an atypical perception of risk, a cluster analysis, based on the risk perceptions of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use, was run to isolate the groups in which pupils tend to answer differently. Six clusters were established classifying students into those who failed to respond, deny the risks, do not know about the risks, see any drug use as great risk, see regular use as great risk, and who see a moderate risk for most frequencies of use. The nonresponders, risk deniers, and those ignorant of the risks are infrequent making up, in all, only 16.9% of the total sample. Gender, country, alcohol use, cannabis use, tobacco use, and friends' consumption were used to describe both the individual risk perceptions and the clusters based on them. Both global context (country) and ""micro"" context (frequencies of drug use, peers lifestyle, and parental permissiveness) appear to play a major role in the risk perception of drug use.

429,"Beck, S. J. (1949",Content.,"The range of associational content projected by the Rorschach test figures has no boundaries. Anything may be seen and is seen. This is true in even a small group of records and the more so in an extensive one. Individualized twists, oddities, and sometimes bizarre constructions are forever turning up; so much so that no Rorschach test can be started without expectation of totally new content. Even simple records contain surprises. The originalities reach their qualitative and quantitative extremes on the one hand in adults at very high levels of intelligence and on the other in schizophrenia. The originality of superior adults becomes exaggerated, even by the standards for their group, when they are being psychoanalyzed. For all this breadth, there is concentration in two principal categories. These are the percepts of humans, H, and animals, A, with human detail, Hd, and animal detail, Ad. Adding to these the anatomy, An, association, we encompass the majority of associations. The specific humans include the usual man, woman, and child percepts and all terms whereby humans are identified, e.g., references to nationality, particular historical period, vocation, proper names of individuals. Of more importance, in projecting personal interest, are the more specialized human classifications: e.g., religious figures, e.g., 'angel,' 'devil,' these being scored H. The animal, A, scoring attaches to all content referring to any animal species other than man--mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, insects, and even microscopic and one-celled animals. In the case of the latter two the content also is classified as science, Sc. Anatomy, An, responses differ from human detail, Hd, in this: Hd designates outer body portions easily seen and commonly known; An refers to inner portions, usually known only by reason of special study, but also to laymen personally exposed to anatomic illustrations or to medical diagrams. All scientifically named anatomic sections are An; so are all X rays, and some, though not all, effects of disease or of surgery. The other content classifications used in this text, with their abbreviations, follow in alphabetical order. With exception of Art and Sex, two-letter abbreviations are employed for all categories. The Double Content Designations are also explained, along with the x response. The essence of the x response is that the S sees a part of a human or animal where most healthy subjects, if they react with that content at all, see the whole human or animal.

The aim of this study was to analyse how certain family-related variables (permissiveness toward drug use, and parental control and affect) were linked to the use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, based on young people's self-report of such variables. Method: The sample was composed of 1,428 school children (51.8% males) aged between 11 and 19 from Mallorca (Spain). Results: We found that the young people who perceived their parents as permissive and those who perceived less maternal control and higher levels of both paternal and maternal affect were more likely to use alcohol, tobacco and cannabis. Sex differences were found within this pattern. Variables of maternal affect and control were not influential among males, whereas the general pattern was maintained among females. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of perceived permissiveness and the need of considering parent's and children's gender when providing control and affect, as fathers will influence male children whereas mothers will influence female children.

Polysomnography offers a modern methodology for evaluating the objective effects of taking homeopathic remedies that clinicians claim exert effects on sleep quality in susceptible individuals. Animal studies have previously shown changes in non rapid eye movement sleep with certain homeopathic remedies. Methods: Young adults of both sexes (ages 18-31) with above-average scores on standardized personality scales for either cynical hostility or anxiety sensitivity (but not both) and a history of coffee-induced insomnia participated in the month-long study. At-home polysomnographic recordings were obtained on successive pairs of nights once per week for a total of eight recordings (nights 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23). Subjects (N = 54) received placebo pellets on night 8 (single-blind) and verum pellets on night 22 (double- blind) in 30c doses of one of two homeopathic remedies, Nux Vomica or Coffea Cruda. Subjects completed daily morning sleep diaries and weekly Pittsburgh sleep quality index scales, as well as profile of mood states scales at bedtime on polysomnography nights. Results: Verum remedies significantly increased PSG total sleep time and NREM, as well as awakenings and stage changes. Changes in actigraphic and self-rated scale effects were not significant. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the feasibility of using in-home, all-night sleep recordings to study homeopathic remedy effects. Findings are similar though not identical to those reported in animals with the same remedies. Possible mechanisms include initial disruption of the nonlinear dynamics of sleep patterns by the verum remedies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,431

Aim: To assess sildenafil efficacy in sexually dissatisfied men with mild ED. Main Outcome Measures: Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS), IIEF, Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ), Erection Hardness Score (EHS 4 = completely hard/fully rigid), general efficacy questions (GEQs), event log questions (hardness sufficient for penetration, duration sufficient for successful intercourse, ejaculation/orgasm, and second erection within 24 hours), and analog scales (erection firmness, reliability, and maintenance, and general sexual performance). Methods: Eight-week DBPC flexible-dose (25, 50, or 100 mg) trial with 6-week, open-label (OL) extension. Results: One hundred and seventy-six men were randomized (mean +/- standard deviation: age, 50 +/- 12 year; ED duration, 3.5 +/- 3.2 year). Most had organic or mixed ED. For sildenafil vs. placebo, 66% vs. 89% titrated to 100 mg and efficacy at DBPC end was better, including the EDITS Index score (least squares mean [standard error], 80.3 [2.3] vs. 62.1 [2.5]; P < 0.0001); treatment satisfaction (EDITS Index score >50 in 89% vs. 63%; P = 0.0001); no ED (IIEF-EF >= 26 in 58% vs. 39%; P < 0.05); GEQs (>=4.9-fold greater odds of improved erections and ability to have sexual intercourse); and EHS 4 (47.2% vs. 25.2% of occasions; P < 0.0001). At OL end, 93% of men were satisfied (EDITS Index score > 50), 77% had no ED, and >= 89% were GEQ responders; mean scores on IIEF domains, the QEQ, and analog scales were >80% of the maximum; 60% of occasions had EHS 4; and event log responses were positive on >80% of occasions, except for second erections (41.9%).

The purpose of this study was (a) to identify the clusters of risk takers among young women based on their perceptions of and motivations for sexual risk taking in tourism and (b) to profile the clusters with respect to the psychological, sexual, demographic, and tourist characteristics. The data were collected through an online survey of 853 women (age in years: MÂ =Â 23.5, SDÂ =Â 6.67). Five clusters of sexual risk takers emerged based on their factor-analyzed risk perceptions and motivations. These clusters were interpreted as (a) diversely motivated broad risk perceivers; (b) fun-seeking broad risk perceivers; (c) diversely motivated physical risk perceivers; (d) anonymity- and empowerment-seeking risk disregarders; and (e) unmotivated broad risk perceivers. Women in these clusters differed in their intentions to engage in sexual risk taking in tourism, sensation-seeking propensities, perceptions of tourist characteristics, levels of sexual experience, and demographic backgrounds. Results suggest tailoring sexual health promotion messages based on cluster affiliation, leveraging cluster-specific risk perceptions, motivations, and personal characteristics.

435,"Berdychevsky, Y. (2016",Women's sexual risk-taking in tourism.,"Tourism research suggests that sexual risk-taking tends to be more prevalent in tourism environments. Tourism has been described as a context condoning higher degrees of sexual freedom, allowing for situational disinhibition, and rendering sexual double standards less pervasive than in everyday life. The purpose of this study was to explore the links between tourism, risk-taking, and sexual behavior among female college students. This study used a sequential mixed methods design, starting with a qualitative and proceeding to a quantitative phase. The qualitative data were analyzed using a phenomenological lens. Fifteen individual, 1.5-2.5 hours long interviews were conducted with 13 women aged 19-24 years. The quantitative phase drew upon the findings from the qualitative phase and relevant literature. The data were collected using an online survey, resulting in a sample of 853 university women (mean age - 23.5 years). Both qualitative and quantitative findings revealed that sexual risk-taking in tourism is a multidimensional and complex phenomenon. The qualitative phase identified five universal and common dimensions of sexual risk-taking in tourism for the women, including physical/sexual health, social, emotional, mental/self-perception, and cultural. The quantitative phase facilitated statistical exploration of sexual risk-taking in tourism with a larger sample and identified three dimensions: physical/sexual health, mental/emotional, and socio-cultural. Both qualitative and quantitative findings revealed a variety of motivations that trigger women.s sexual risk-taking in tourism environments. The quantitative results suggested that this variety of motivations can be grouped into three dimensions: anonymity/detachment/experimentation; safe exploration/thrill/empowerment; and fun/less inhibitions/opportunity. In the quantitative phase, the women were clustered based on their perceived dimensions of sexual risk-taking and motivations for it. Five clusters were identified: high and diverse risk perceivers motivated by anonymity and exploration; moderate and diverse risk perceivers motivated by fun; low risk perceivers with diverse motivations; low risk perceivers motivated by exploration; and unmotivated, high and diverse risk perceivers. The importance of this study stems from the development of a deeper understanding of sexual risk-taking in tourism. In turn, this increased understanding may provide directions for health programs and/or information campaigns aimed at addressing sexual risk behaviors among young women.

(2014",Too smart for their own good?: Images of young Jewish women in television and film.,"In the first season of the Fox cable network television show Glee, the handsome, bad-boy football player Noah ""Puck"" Puckerman discusses the ambitious and brainy Rachel Berry saying, ""That Rachel chick makes me want to light myself on fire, but she can sing."" Here Puck is praising Rachel's singing talent while rebuking her personality. One important aspect of this scene is the pairing of these two characters - Puck and Rachel, both Jewish characters on the show-highlighting the differing images of Jewish male characters and Jewish female characters present in television and film today. Such a double standard has existed in images of Jews since their first representation on screen; however, images of Jewish women and men since 2000 have evolved and changed over the decades to reflect contemporary demographic and social concerns relevant to the twenty-first century. Young, unmarried Jewish women like Rachel Berry are portrayed as ambitious intellectuals and artists who often choose their talent and careers over interpersonal relationships, while Jewish men like Puck are presented as approachable slackers who ultimately get rewarded with popularity and acceptance in their relationships with non-Jewish partners. This example represents a trend evident in at least five instances from television and film released since the year 2000 in which the young, Jewish female characters are portrayed as smart and creative individuals, yet their intelligence and talents are shown to trump and ruin their personal lives. To contextualize today's images of brainy and creative Jewish women, I begin first with some background on the JAP and the broader communal concerns that fed that image. Next I outline the current demographic trends and concerns in the American Jewish community, for just as anxieties in the Jewish community helped produce the JAP image, contemporary communal trends are also reflected in images of young Jewish women today. These trends provide demographic background for these images, and such trends parallel several characteristics of images of young Jewish women in television and film. I then discuss the five films and television series distributed in the twenty-first century that feature young, unmarried Jewish women as central characters in contemporary environments. While there are Jewish creators behind each of these examples who have contributed to these images of Jewish women and men, the main concern is the resulting images and how they parallel current trends and their consequences. To better understand the particular characteristics of young Jewish women and the consequences of these images, I then compare these images of Jewish women to young Jewish men. It is clear in this comparison that images of Jewish men-once presented as overly ambitious and neurotic-have evolved into approachable characters with mediocre ambitions who are rewarded with successful relationships and productive sexuality. Jewish women, however, are often represented as alienating their friends and romantic partners with their intelligence and ambitious creative pursuits. The continued pairing of the American Jewish community's demographic trends and images of Jews in television and film demonstrates that young Jewish women are still marginalized in these images when compared to the successes of Jewish men.

Case scenarios varied with respect to the prior relationship (strangers, acquaintances, ex-partners) and coercive strategy (force vs. exploiting victim intoxication). More blame was attributed to the victim and less blame was attributed to the perpetrator for rape than for robbery. Information about a prior relationship between victim and perpetrator increased ratings of victim blame and decreased perceptions of perpetrator blame in the rape cases, but not in the robbery cases.

The findings showed that attractiveness of defined primarily by appearance, femininity by behavior and inferred traits, and sexual appeal by both. More single than married women had changed definitions of these terms, and more single women perceived themselves as having grown more attractive, feminine, and sexually appealing as they grew older. Age differences in these evaluations were found among the group of married woman, but few age differences were found among single women. The findings suggest there may be qualitatively differing experiences between single and married women that are reflected in their evaluations of attractiveness and sexual appeal.",0,441

The sample was composed of programs portraying an LGB lead or reoccurring character. Results showed that heterosexual and LGB characters engaged in sexual talk and behavior in similar contexts. When discussing LGB sexualities, however, heterosexual characters were disproportionately likely to make jokes; LGB characters were disproportionately likely to discuss coming out. LGB characters depicted in sexual references were more likely to be in dialogue with a heterosexual character than another LGB character. Sexual consequences were more common for heterosexual characters than LGB characters. No gender differences existed in frequency of sexual references or consequences among LGB characters, evidence that the sexual double standard found in previous research may not apply to LGB characters.

443,"Bosch, O. G., et al. (2017",Neural underpinnings of prosexual effects induced by gamma-hydroxybutyrate in healthy male humans.,"Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a GHB-/GABAB-receptor agonist currently used as treatment for narcolepsy but also as a drug of abuse. Non-medical GHB users have repeatedly reported prosexual effects including libido-enhancement and lowering of attractiveness standards for partner selection. Here, we examined the putative prosexual effects of oral GHB in healthy males in two experiments both employing randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced, and cross-over study designs. In experiment I, subjective effects of 20 and 35mg/kg GHB vs. placebo were tested in 32 participants using the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory. In experiment II, brain reactivity towards erotic vs. neutral pictures was investigated in 15 participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging after 35mg/kg GHB vs. placebo. In experiment I, prosexual effects of GHB were shown by increased SADI ratings regarding physiological, evaluative, and motivational aspects of sexual arousal. In experiment II, erotic visual stimuli activated the bilateral insula, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), fusiform gyrus, thalamus, and left occipital pole under placebo. After GHB administration, even sexually neutral pictures of persons induced subjective sexual arousal and increased activation of the bilateral NAcc and right anterior cingulate cortex, which significantly correlated (left NAcc by trend). Moreover, a psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that GHB increased connectivity between NAcc and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during processing of visual erotic cues, i.e., in the condition in which subjective sexual arousal was highest. Our data show that GHB stimulates hedonic sexual functioning and lowers the threshold for erotic perception, which is related to increased susceptibility of mesolimbic reward pathways.

444,"Boudjemadi, V. and K. Gana (2012",Effect of mortality salience on implicit ageism: Implication of age stereotypes and sex.,"Introduction: This research deals with the explanation of ageism by terror management theory (TMT) (Greenberg et al., 2002). Within this framework, there was an attempt to respond to two limits: a use of direct measurement procedures and a focus on the superordinate category. Objectives: The goal of the first study (n =188) was to test the effect of mortality salience (MS) on implicit ageism by taking into account the social cognitive perspective on age stereotypes (SCPAS) (Hummert, 1999). The second study (n =185) dealt with the impact of MS, the sex of the targets, and the sex of the participants on implicit ageism. Results: In the first study, results showed that in the control condition, 90-year-old targets were rated more negatively than 60-year-old targets, and participants in the MS condition made no distinction between the targets. In the second study, according to the double standard of aging (DSA) (Teuscher and Teuscher, 2006), elderly women were rated more negatively than elderly men in the control condition and consistent with TMT, MS increased ageism only when participants and targets were of the same sex. Conclusion: The findings suggest the following: when faced with their own death, young people do not differentiate old people; old people represent a threatening future self that is close to death. Results, limitations and implications for future research are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,444
445,"Bovens, L. (2009",Can the Catholic Church agree to condom use by HIV-discordant couples?,"Does the position of the Roman Catholic Church on contraception also imply that the usage of condoms by HIV-discordant couples is illicit? A standard argument is to appeal to the doctrine of double effect to condone such usage, but this meets with the objection that there exists an alternative action that brings about the good effect-namely, abstinence. I argue against this objection, because an HIV-discordant couple does not bring about any bad outcome through condom usage-there is no disrespect displayed for the generative function of sex. One might retort that the badness of condom usage consists in thwarting the unitive function of sex. I argue that also this objection cannot be upheld. In conclusion, if there are no in-principle objections against condom usage for HIV-discordant couples, then policies that deny access to condoms to such couples are indefensible. HIV discordant couples have a right to continue consummating their marriage in a manner that is minimally risky and this right cannot be trumped by utilitarian concerns that the distribution of condoms might increase promiscuity and along with it the HIV infection rate.

(2016","Association of ABCB1 gene variants, plasma antidepressant concentration, and treatment response: Results from a randomized clinical study.","P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, functions as an ATP-driven efflux pump in the blood-brain barrier, extruding its substrates and thereby limiting their passage into the brain. ABCB1 polymorphisms predicted antidepressant drug response: Minor allele carriers of SNPs rs2032583 and rs2235015 had higher remission rates than major allele homozygotes. The aim of the current study was to evaluate an ABCB1 genotype-dependent efficacy of a quick dose escalation strategy. Depressed inpatients (n = 73) treated with antidepressants that are P-glycoprotein substrates were randomly assigned to a standard or high dose condition for 28 days. HAM-D scores, adverse effects and plasma antidepressant concentration were measured weekly and tested among two intronic SNPs rs2032583 and rs2235015. A treatment as usual control sample (n = 128) was retrospectively matched to the study group by gender, age, and diagnosis. There was a significant interaction of genotype x plasma antidepressant concentration: Minor allele carriers of rs2032583 [F(1,65) = 7.221, p = 0.009] and rs2235015 [F(1,65) = 4.939, p = 0.030] whose plasma drug concentration were within recommended range had a greater symptom reduction at study endpoint which exceeded the therapeutic benefit of the treatment as usual group [for rs2032583: F(1,163) = 4.366, p = 0.038]. Minor allele carriers of rs2032583 with high plasma drug levels had more sleep-related side effects than major allele homozygotes with high plasma drug levels. The treatment of MDD can be optimized by ABCB1 genotyping combined with monitoring of plasma drug concentrations: For minor allele carriers of rs2032583 and rs2235015, plasma antidepressant levels should not exceed the recommended range in order to obtain optimal treatment outcome.

447,"Brems, C., et al. (1995",Assessment of fairness in child custody decisions.,"Court-appointed child advocates, attorneys, guardians ad litem, and therapists were asked to rate preferred traits for mothers and fathers, and to make custody decisions and abuse likelihood ratings for children in one of two vignettes that varied only as to whether mother or father was described as incompetent to parent without threat of further abuse. Results revealed that this sample of professionals did not hold double standards with respect to attributes important for mothers versus fathers. To the contrary, interpersonal sensitivity traits, traditionally identified as most prevalent among women, were valued equally in mothers and fathers and preferred for both parents to interpersonal potency, traditionally ascribed more readily to men. Further, decisions about custody and placement or abuse likelihood were not affected by any sex-role stereotypes professionals held about parents, nor by professionals' gender or specific occupation. The only factor that affected custody judgments and abuse likelihood ratings was the competence of the parent in question. These findings suggest that biases with regard to gender or traditional sex-role preferences for parents are disappearing among professionals who make important placement decisions in the lives of abused children. Future studies must assess whether these theoretical findings translate into actual behavior in real-life abuse cases for the professional groups represented in this sample. Â© 1995.",0,447

Womenâs ideas concerning relations between the sexes are discussed in tandem with their broader political outlooks; and the authors demonstrate that the development of a distinctively sexual politics is reflected in womenâs critiques of marriage, the double standard, and womenâs exclusion from government.

(2011",Testing the double standard for candidate emotionality: Voter reactions to the tears and anger of male and female politicians.,"Many have speculated that voters hold double standards for male and female political candidates that disadvantage women. One common assumption is that female candidates are penalized disproportionately for displays of crying and anger; however, the field lacks a theoretical or empirical foundation for examining this matter. The first half of this article establishes the theoretical basis for how emotional displays are likely to influence evaluations of female versus male candidates. Using a large-N, representative sample of U.S. adults, the second half tests these dynamics experimentally. The main finding is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, no double standard exists for emotionality overall: male and female candidates are similarly penalized for both anger and crying. There are, however, different responses to the tears of male and female candidates depending on whether the respondent is a man or woman.

Nonsexual and sexual intimacy and aloofness were measured by codes that focused on husband-wife intimacy and aloofness and frequency of premarital and extramarital sex for males and females. Measures of hypermasculinity were included in order to test the proposition that husband-wife interaction is related in a systematic way to male self-concepts. A correlation matrix was computed so that overall patterning of male-female relationships across variables could be assessed. Results indicate that societies are neither entirely consistent nor entirely arbitrary in their patterning of heterosexual relationships. Three clusters or dimensions of opposite-sex interaction were isolated so that variables within a cluster were highly correlated and variables in different clusters were largely unrelated. This research suggests that sexual relationships, nonsexual intimacy, and male sexual orientation are not highly related to each other.

455,"Buckland, W. (2007",,"Ronald Reagan was in the middle of his first term in office as president. His prospects for a second term looked bleak. By the end of the year, the U.S. economy was still in recession, with the manufacturing, auto, and housing industries in decline and unemployment over 10 percent. The administration slashed the federal budget for domestic outlays while increasing military spending and cutting taxes, which only ballooned the already-considerable national deficit. Many large private corporations (except in the defense industry) posted disastrous earnings. Such problems sharply diminished Reagan's political impact at home. Abroad, especially in the Middle East and Central America, headaches abounded. Reagan's solution to domestic and foreign problems was twofold: (1) reduce the federal government's size, influence, and regulation and introduce supply-side economics; and (2) send a message that ""America is back"" and ""America is walking tall,"" no longer haunted by its defeat in Vietnam. Reagan rhetoric became synonymous with the following cluster of terms: nostalgia, populism, anti-intellectualism, aggressive self-confidence, spiritual uplift, and reassurance, all focused around an attack on liberalism and secular humanism. The result was the reification of a structure at the center of Western thought: The opposition between Self and Other. The Other defines everything that exists outside the Self; the Self is therefore defined in relation to or against the Other; indeed, the Self exists only through the Other. Hegel's maxim sums up this structure exactly: ""Man exists only in so far as he is opposed."" The Manichean opposition between Self and Other is inherently unstable, which encourages the Self to take control and master the Other. This leads to violence, oppression, and exploitation, in the form of racism, sexism, and colonialism. Reaganite ideology rigidly exaggerated the status of the Self against the Other, whether through government deregulation to ""preserve"" individual liberty or a foreign policy that perpetuated patriotic nationalism in the form of Cold War ideology (aimed at the Soviet Union and other havens of communism such as Nicaragua). Reagan strongly enforced traditional values such as the legacy of individualism, developing a distorted sense of self-empowerment and self-importance, which prompts a defensive attitude toward any kind of criticism. Popular films should not be ghettoized within the sphere of public entertainment, because they articulate and represent contemporary issues concerning identity and politics, especially the opposition between Self and Other. This is evident in one of the prominent genres of the year: science fiction and fantasy. Films from this genre are centrally preoccupied with the representation of an Other world and its inhabitants, whose otherness reinforces (or occasionally challenges) the boundaries of the Self, although usually on a more benign level than the patriotic nationalism of 1980s Cold War ideology. Science fiction and fantasy films discussed in this chapter include E.T., Poltergeist, Blade Runner, and Tron. The other worlds represented in these films were coded either as the future, perhaps in a galaxy far, far away, or as a world within the new technology that was beginning to inhabit our work and home space: The personal computer. The more fantastic and alien the other world is portrayed, the stronger it challenges our sense of Self. Additional films examined here, in their metaphorical representation of Other worlds and the identity of their inhabitants, include One from the Heart, The Loveless, and Chan Is Missing. A number of industries bucked the depressing economic and political trends. Hollywood economics were largely unaffected by the recession, and the new electronic industries-focused around cable television, videocassettes, PCs, and video games-witnessed steady or, in some cases, dramatic growth. Collectively, these new industries constitute the entertainment dimensions of the Information Age, an age in which electronic technologies revolutionized ""the production and distribution of entertainment and information"" (Wasko 1). Cable TV grew due to government deregulation of the industry, but it didn't take off until later in the decade. As for the VCR, Sony marketed the first home video machine in 1975 (the Betamax system), soon rivaled by Matsushita and JVC's VHS format the next year. The VCR (especially the VHS system) soon demonstrated impressive market penetration: Two million units were sold this year, more than double the sales of just two years earlier (Wasko 124). This hardware boom was accompanied by a growth in videotape rental, which, due to the expense of the tapes, was more common than purchase. The burgeoning demand for videotapes led to the creation of a new type of establishment, the video rental store, which increasingly appeared on street corners and in shopping malls or were integrated into larger stores. In 1980 only 2,500 video stores existed; two years later over 13,000 were up and running (Wasko 150), most independently owned (Blockbuster did not begin operating until 1985). The recording capacity of the VCR soon created copyright problems for the film industry, signaling the beginnings of video piracy. Yet in the form of videotape rentals, the studios discovered an additional platform for releasing (or re-releasing) its films, which of course meant an additional source of revenue-very important for expensive films such as Blade Runner that did not find their audience during the initial theatrical release. (The studios did not receive revenues from the rentals themselves, but from the sale of tapes to rental stores [see Prince 103].) Thus this year stands out for the beginning of the video revolution, which, like other electronic industries, exploded in the mid-eighties. The PC revolution was also in full swing for both business and home users. In particular, other worlds and virtual spaces were represented not only in spreadsheets and word processing, but also in the craze for computer games. The computer game industry was already worth around $2 billion as home and arcade video games had reached their Golden Age. The 18 January issue of Time magazine featured video games on its cover and led with a feature article profiling the arcade culture. (In December Time also named the computer ""Machine of the Year"" rather than choosing its traditional ""Man of the Year."") Throughout the country over 1.5 million arcade machines were in operation (Kent 152). Just before the summer blockbuster season began, Aljean Harmetz reported in the New York Times that ""there is a feeling throughout the industry that Hollywood has at last 'hit the target,' 'made movie-movies,' and 'loaded the gun with star power'"" (C11). By the end of the summer season, she confirmed that it had been ""the most lucrative summer in the history of the movies"" (C22), with a 17 percent increase in box office over 1981. Universal enjoyed the most success, led of course by E.T., distantly followed by The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Paramount's big hits were Star Trek II and An Officer and a Gentleman. MGM/UA had a good year with Poltergeist and Rocky III, while Warner Bros.' primary success was Clint Eastwood's Firefox. Columbia, however, barely recovered its $40 million budget on the musical Annie, and Twentieth Century Fox lagged further behind, experiencing major disappointments with Megaforce and the comedies Author! Author! and Six Pack. The year also witnessed several strong dramas. In addition to An Officer and a Gentleman, a surprise hit, there was also Alan J. Pakula's solemn Sophie's Choice, a study of a Holocaust survivor (Meryl Streep) living in Brooklyn; Costa Gavras's political thriller Missing, based on a true story in which a father (Jack Lemmon) goes to Chile to search for his son; Alan Parker's poignant study of divorce, Shoot the Moon; David S. Ward's adaptation of John Steinbeck's Cannery Row; Barry Levinson's directorial debut, Diner, a nostalgic look at the rites of passage of five young men in 1959 Baltimore; Fred Zinnemann's fina film, Five Days One Summer, a love story starring Sean Connery about a man who takes his young mistress with him on a mountaineering adventure to Switzerland; and the psychological thriller Still of the Night, with strong performances from Streep and Roy Scheider. Many 3-D movies from the 1950s were reissued, while Friday 13th Part III was shot in 3-D and released on over 800 screens. Yet the revival was shortlived, as interest in 3-D soon shifted to video games. Women directors also made an impact, including Kathryn Bigelow's first full-length film, The Loveless, and Susan Seidelman's debut, the independently produced Smithereens. The latter follows the downward spiral of Wren (Susan Berman), who rejects comforting but bland lower-middleclass values in favor of the offbeat, nihilistic lifestyle of punk culture. This Other world is full of demoralized characters on the margins of society, yet it is from this position that Wren dreams of fame and fortune without comprehending the reality of her situation: she is talentless, powerless, penniless, alienated, isolated, marginalized, and self-destructive. Seidelman made the film for $80,000 soon after graduating from New York University (as well as directing, she also co-wrote the screenplay and edited and produced the film). Smithereens earned a reputation at film festivals (including Cannes, where it became the first independently produced American film to be accepted in the main competition) before receiving a limited commercial release. Two other women directors also gained a foothold in the film industry this year: Amy Heckerling, with her hugely successful teen comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and Amy Holden Jones, who produced and directed the reflexive send-up slasher movie Slumber Party Massacre, written by feminist author Rita Mae Brown. There was also a mini-cycle of mainstream gay-themed films, which as a group received little press attention at the time; these included Arthur Hiller's Making Love, Robert Towne's Personal Best, Blake Edwards's Victor/ Victoria, and James Burrows's Partners. All attempted to offer positive images of homosexuality. Yet Vito Russo has argued that these films failed because they ""were too straight for gay audiences and much too gay for conservative straights"" (271). One problem with these films, according to Russo, is that they negate the Otherness of homosexuality: ""You can't plead tolerance for gays by saying that they're just like everyone else. Tolerance is something we should extend to people who are not like everyone else. If gays weren't different, there wouldn't be a problem, and there certainly is a problem"" (272). Nevertheless, the fact that these films emerged at all during Reagan's first term, which coincided with a rise in Christian fundamen-talism and the Religious Right, again demonstrates ""that resistant liberal forces existed in American culture at odds with the dominant conservative value system"" (Ryan and Kellner 259). In comedy, Eddie Murphy made his film debut in 48 Hrs. The year also witnessed Peter Sellers seemingly brought back to life in Trail of the Pink Panther; he had died two years earlier, but the film features deleted scenes from his previous Pink Panther movies. Similarly, Carl Reiner's comedy Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid kept alive the images of many classical Hollywood stars by skillfully editing together clips from their 1940s film noirs with Reiner's black-and-white footage starring Steve Martin. Finally, a survey would not be complete without mention of the films listed as the worst of the year. In addition to Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart, which made several such lists (more accurately, it was regarded as a talented director's misfire), the generally acknowledged bombs of the year include Frank Perry's Monsignor (about a priest, played by Christopher Reeve, who seduces a nun); Matt Cimber's Butterfly (the scandal surrounding Pia Zadora's Golden Globe award makes the film a historical curiosity), Hal Needham's tacky Megaforce, Richard Donner's shallow social commentary comedy The Toy, and the completely pointless sequel Grease II (Pat Burch returned to choreography after directing this film). Such films are just as important as the recognized winners in defining the year, for they provide a counter-balance to orthodox, standard film histories that only focus on successes.

Children's behavior, language skills, and preacademic skills were analyzed as a function of CC quality (low-, medium-, and high-quality groups based on the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale total scores), background risk factors, and parental attitudes to test hypotheses about risk and protective factors. Results reveal that quality of CC is related to children's development for all children and quite limited support that CC quality may matter more for children experiencing social risk factors. Language development was the only outcome in which CC quality interacted with a risk variable, ethnicity, suggesting that quality of care is differentially more important for language development for children of color than for White-non-Hispanic children.

It is unknown whether standard medical therapy to treat LS results in improved sexual functioning. Aims: To describe sexual function in women with LS and to assess if LS-associated sexual dysfunction decreases after appropriate medical therapy. Methods: Women enrolled in a double-blind trial 12-week trial comparing clobetasol vs. pimecrolimus for the treatment of LS were administered the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) upon enrollment and at the end of the trial. The difference in the total score on the FSDS between the two groups before and after treatment was assessed with a paired t-test. Main Outcome Measures: The change in mean FSDS score from baseline to 12 weeks. Results: A total of 31 out of 36 enrolled women had adequate treatment of LS as determined by a dermatopathologist's evaluation of pre and post-treatment biopsy specimens. The mean baseline FSDS score for the clobetasol group was 29 and, post-treatment, it was 15 (P = 0.001). In the pimecrolimus group, the mean baseline FSDS score was 27 and, post-treatment, it was 21 (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Despite adequate treatment, women with LS continue to have significant sexual dysfunction as assessed by the FSDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,458

460,"Bustamante, F., et al. (2016",Trends and most frequent methods of suicide in Chile between 2001 and 2010.,"Background: Despite the many studies trying to evaluate the magnitude of suicide in Chile, none of them include the new valid data, recently published by the DEIS of the Chilean Health Ministry. Aim: This paper sought to describe how suicide rates changed among Chileans who were at least 15 years of age during the period of 2001-2010; these rates were stratified by sex, age, urban/rural status, and region of the country. Method: An exploratory and temporal study was conducted. Suicide mortality rates were calculated by collecting information from the Chilean Ministry of Health's death registry between 2001 and 2010 among subjects who were at least 15 years of age. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were computed. Results: The standardized suicide rate in Chile during 2001-2010 was 14.7 deaths per 100,000, the highest in South America. The minimum age-adjusted suicide rate observed during the examined period was 13.49 per 100,000 in 2005, and the maximum, 16.67 per 100,000 in 2008. Suicide rates among men were up to 4.8 times the suicide rates among women. In addition, rates in rural areas were double compared with urban areas. Hanging was the most common suicide method, followed by use of firearms and explosives in men and poisoning in women.

There is a disturbing increase in suicide rates among younger individuals and women, although these rates remain lower among younger individuals and women than among adults in general.

The study's primary outcome measures were the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity. Twenty-six adults who met criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sub-optimal functioning were randomly assigned to supplement their existing psychostimulant treatment regimen with either a titrated dose (1-6mg) of extended release guanfacine hydrochloride or a matching placebo for a 10-week trial. The data were analyzed with standard mixed model analysis of variance procedures, and participants in both the investigational agent group and the placebo group showed statistically significant improvement in their symptoms and functioning over the course of the trial. The treatments did not differ in terms of their efficacy, safety, or tolerability. Although these results do suggest that both treatments were associated with clinical improvement, the possible impacts of socially desirable responding and regression to the mean on these results are discussed.

Purpose: This study was designed to investigate the effects of reviewers' gender on the assessment of a gender-related study. Method: One hundred reviewers (50 women) were randomly selected from Academic Medicine's reviewer pool. Two versions of an empirical study of medical students in which women forecast a lower professional income than men were prepared, and each version was randomly assigned to 25 men and 25 women reviewers. The two versions were identical except for one sentence in the abstract and two sentences in the conclusion. Version 1 attributed the lower forecast income of women to intrinsic gender factors (e.g., lower financial incentives). Version 2 attributed the difference to extrinsic social learning factors (e.g., socialization bias). Results: Results showed no significant gender difference in reviewers' evaluations of the two manuscript versions. Conclusion: Although no evidence of reviewers' gender bias was found in this study, alternative explanations of the findings suggest that further empirical research is needed.

465,"Caine, B. (2011",,"As the son of a woman long noted for her fervent and constant advocacy of womenâs rights, Oscar Wilde was well acquainted with late-nineteenth-century feminist discussions and debates. Jane Wilde was vocal in her support for better education for women, and her hostility to the sexual double standard in all its forms. She regarded the passing of the 1882 Married Womenâs Property Rights Act, which gave married woman a legal identity, and hence the right to enter into contracts and to buy and sell their own separate property, as the inauguration of âa new era in English and Irish social lifeâ. No longer would a woman enter marriage âas a bond slave, disenfranchised of all rights over her fortuneâ. With or without the influence of his mother, it is more than likely that Wilde would have been aware of a number of the significant debates about womenâs rights which were underway in the last few decades of the nineteenth century. From the 1860s onwards, there had been organized campaigns in Britain directed towards gaining educational, legal and political rights for women, and at removing the restrictions that limited their employment. At the end of the decade another was added directed towards the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts which sought to regulate prostitution in specified areas. Several of these campaigns had achieved some measure of success by the 1880s, as one can see in the Married Womenâs Property Acts of 1882, the admission of women to several new universities alongside the establishment of university entrance exams and of colleges for women at both Oxford and Cambridge, and the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. There was still a long way to go until women were given the suffrage â or admitted to degrees at the two ancient universities, or given equal rights in marriage in terms of property and custody or the right to refuse their husbandâs absolute sexual access to their own bodies â but the first steps had been taken.

However, little is known about antidepressant efficacy profile in relation with socio-demographic and clinical features in this population. The aim of the present study was to define the most suitable socio-demographic and clinical profile for the use of antidepressant treatments in late-life depression. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on efficacy of antidepressants of all classes in major depressed elderly subjects (>60 years old). Reviews and meta-analyses focusing on this topic have been considered as well. Thirty-four RCTs were included and socio-demographic and clinical features were investigated via meta-regression analysis as moderators of efficacy measures (standardized mean difference based on Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). Results: A lower rate of response to antidepressants of all classes was found in patients of male gender, of older age, and with a longer mean duration of the current episode. On the contrary, a higher rate of response was found in patients with a higher baseline severity and at their first episode of illness. Subsamples treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone yielded similar results. Limitations: RCTs only have been included. Conclusions: A number of socio-demographic and clinical features have been found to moderate antidepressant efficacy in elderly population.

The clinical profile of PSD502 is described in one of two double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III studies. Aim: To determine the effect of PSD502 on the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) and intravaginal ejaculatory latency (IELT) of men with lifelong PE. Methods: Men with lifelong PE who documented an IELT <= 1 minute with two or more of the first three sexual encounters during a 4-week baseline period were randomized to receive double-blind treatment with PSD502 or placebo for 3 months. Patients completed IPE and Premature Ejaculation Profile questionnaires at entry and monthly visits, and recorded stop-watch timed IELT during each encounter. Safety was assessed by collecting adverse event data and standard safety measures. Main Outcome Measures: Stopwatch timed IELT recordings and a patient-reported outcome questionnaire the IPE were used in this study to determine the effect of PSD502 applied topically 5 minutes before intercourse. Results: Two hundred fifty-six men with PE were randomized from 38 centers in the U.S., Canada, and Poland. The geometric mean IELT over the 3-month treatment period increased from a baseline of 0.56 minute and 0.53 minute in the PSD502 and placebo group respectively to 2.60 and 0.80 minute. There were significantly greater increases in the scores for the IPE domains of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction and distress in the PSD502 group than in the placebo group, with a mean 5.0 point difference between treatments in change from baseline in the IPE domain for ejaculatory control, 4.6 point difference in change from baseline in the IPE domain for sexual satisfaction, and a 2.5 point difference in change from baseline in the IPE domain for distress. This was supported by improvements in all secondary endpoints. Conclusion: In this study, PSD502 applied topically to the glans penis 5 minutes before intercourse showed significantly improved ejaculatory latency, ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction and distress and was shown to be well tolerated by patients and partners.

However no specific instruments to identify manic symptoms were used. Objectives: To assess the frequency of anxiety and mood disorders (particularly bipolar disorders and manic symptoms) in a consecutive sample of women affected by FM using standardized diagnostic tools and to compare the prevalence of these disorders with that observed in a sample of healthy controls from the general population. Methods: Cases: consecutive series of women (N = 37, mean age 50.1 +/- 21.0) attending a Rheumatology outpatient Unit at the University of Cagliari. Controls: 148 women, drawn from the data bank of an epidemiological study matched for sex and age with controls according to a randomisation ""after blocks"" method. The Italian version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Simplified were carried out by physicians. Psychiatric diagnosis was formulated according to DSM-IV criteria. The Italian version of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was administered to identify manic symptoms and bipolar disorders. Diagnosis of FM were carried out by rheumatologist according to the criteria of American College of Rheumatology. Results: Subjects with FM showed a higher comorbidity with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder than controls. The study showed a high frequency of manic symptoms (MDQ positive) in the sample of fibromyalgic patients (59%), approximately double that found in the control sample (P < 0.001). Discussion: Clinical studies have shown the efficacy of antidepressants, especially tricyclic antidepressants, in the treatment of FM. The clinical difficulty in identifying hypomanic episodes is well known particularly where previous and not present episodes are concerned as in depressive patients. These data would suggest further studies on the subject are needed and more caution also in prescribing antidepressants in a population apparently at high risk for bipolar disorders.

We investigated whether HSV-2 suppression with aciclovir would reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Methods: We undertook a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial in HIV-negative, HSV-2 seropositive women in Africa and men who have sex with men (MSM) from sites in Peru and the USA. Participants were randomly assigned by block randomisation to twice daily aciclovir 400 mg (n = 1637) or matching placebo (n = 1640) for 12-18 months, and were seen monthly for dispensation of study drug, adherence counselling and measurement by pill count and self-reporting, and risk reduction counselling, and every 3 months for genital examination and HIV testing. The primary outcome was HIV-1 acquisition and secondary was incidence of genital ulcers. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00076232. Findings: 3172 participants (1358 women, 1814 MSM) were included in the primary dataset (1581 in aciclovir group, 1591 in control group). The incidence of HIV-1 was 3.9 per 100 person-years in the aciclovir group (75 events in 1935 person-years of follow-up) and 3.3 per 100 person-years in the placebo group (64 events in 1969 person-years of follow-up; hazard ratio 1.16 [95% CI 0.83-1.62]). Incidence of genital ulcers on examination was reduced by 47% (relative risk 0.53 [0.46-0.62]) and HSV-2 positive genital ulcers by 63% (0.37 [0.31-0.45]) in the aciclovir group. Adherence to dispensed study drug was 94% in the aciclovir group and 94% in the placebo group, and 85% of expected doses in the aciclovir group and 86% in the placebo group.

Nevertheless, adherence with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines to eat between five and nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day is remarkably low. The current study explored the extent to which nonadherent respondents in a national survey (N = 5,625) listed fruit and vegetable consumption as a method by which to decrease their own or others' cancer risk. We sought to determine whether respondents who listed fruit and vegetable consumption as a method by which to decrease their own or others' cancer risk (hereafter referred to as ""listers"") differed from respondents who did not list fruit and vegetable consumption as a method by which to decrease their own or others' cancer risk (hereafter referred to as) ""nonlisters"" on measures of information processing and cancer cognitions. Nonlisters were more likely than listers to seek out cancer information but less likely to trust the information.

480,"Chalhoub, D. (2016",Osteoporosis and sarcopenia in older adults.,"The percentage of individuals older than 65 years of age is increasing. In 2008, approximately 506 million individuals worldwide were older than 65. This number is expected to double and reach 14% of the world's population by year 2040. With this increase, a higher number of older men and women are expected to experience deterioration in their bones and muscles leading to osteoporosis and sarcopenia respectively. Therefore, understanding the burden that osteoporosis and sarcopenia represent in older men and women could have major public health implications. We studied the importance of areal and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in fracture risk prediction in older men. We found that low areal BMD (aBMD) and (vBMD) were both associated with multiple sites of fracture. Nonetheless, low vBMD was not found to be a better predictor of major osteoporotic fractures (Hip, spine wrist, shoulder) compared to aBMD, except at the spine. Subsequently, in the same cohort of older men, we found that low appendicular lean mass was positively associated with central and peripheral bone skeletal size, density and strength parameters that have been previously related to fractures. On the other hand, grip strength was only associated with site specific radial strength and geometric parameters. There was no association between leg power and the skeletal size, density and strength of older men after adjusting for appendicular lean mass and grip strength. These findings highlight the more important role of the mechanical load of the muscles on bones, compared to the muscle strength and power. Finally, we were interested in examining whether sarcopenia with or without osteoporosis is associated with an increased risk of non-spine fractures. In this third paper, we demonstrated that men with both sarcopenia and low BMD are at a much higher risk for nonspine fractures compared to men with either one or neither condition. On the other hand, low BMD with or without sarcopenia in older women was associated with an increased risk of fractures, suggesting that low BMD is the driving force of non-spine fractures in older women. Future research should investigate further the crosstalk between muscle and bones. There are currently multiple sarcopenia definitions. Therefore, a consensus on the definition for sarcopenia should be reached, so that diagnostic and therapeutic tools can be developed. Furthermore, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for fracture risk assessment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,480
481,"Chapireau, F. (2009",Mortality of psychiatric inpatients in France during World War II: A demographic study.,"Introduction.In France, World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945. Under-nourishment was a national problem, and was more severe in mental hospitals. The mortality of psychiatric inpatients in France during World War II has long been a controversial issue in the country. Literature findings.Some authors wrote of the soft extermination of 40 000 mental patients, although this has been proven false. The historical study published in 2007 by Isabelle von Bueltzingsloewen provides in-depth description and analysis of starvation due to food restrictions in French mental hospitals. Although the French official statistic services published detailed data, no demographic study has been published so far. Such studies have been conducted in Norway and in Finland. The influence of a period of under-nourishment upon mortality in mental hospitals can rarely be seen with a clarity equal to that in this work. The strict rationing was the same for everybody, but, extra muros, there was private initiative and ingenuity to help in alleviating the distress. Naturally, patients in institution had no ability to act on their own. The immense increase during the period of war from 1941 to 1945 appeared both as an increase in the exact death-risk and as an increase in the disproportion with normal mortality. The men reacted more strongly than women; which is readily comprehensible on physiological grounds, as the rations were virtually the same for all. Excess mortality continued after the war. Even though under-nourishment had ceased, death rates from tuberculosis remained high the following year. Both papers state that the poor hygiene and bad living conditions existing in mental hospitals before the war worsened the effects of food restrictions. Demographic data.French data were published by the General Statistics of France (SGF) that became the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) in 1946. A series of datasets were published each year according to sex, diagnosis and type of psychiatric institution. In 1943, the outdated diagnostic classification was replaced by a more modern one, with reference to ICD. The same year, the age groups also changed (instead of 3544, it became 3039). Publication of data by type of institution was discontinued in 1943; from 1945 to 1948, the only available data concerned patients in hospital on 31st December, by age, sex and diagnosis. General population data were published by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED). The data referring to civilian population during the war are provided by the Human Mortality Database. This study covers number of people in hospital, mortality rates by sex, age, diagnosis and type of institution, and standardised mortality ratios. These refer to the civilian population which is more relevant since mental patients would not have been allowed to join the armed forces, even if they had not been in hospital. Finally, mortality trends in mental hospitals are compared with those in hospices for old, disabled or incurable people, in order to ascertain whether all vulnerable populations in institutions suffered to the same extent. The results show that the number of inpatients in 1945 was about half the total recorded in 1940, due to fewer admissions and to a large increase in the number of deaths. However, the number of discharges increased in 1940, even though the number of admissions had begun to slow down: many patients were sent to places offering better food and hygiene. The number of deaths began to rise as from 1939. Mortality rates were high in 1940 and especially in 1941, when almost one man in three and more than one woman in five died. Global rates did not change in 1942. In December that year, a government order stated that mental patients should receive more food. Mortality rates went down in 1943 and 1944, but rates did not return to the prewar values until 1946. In 1939, mortality rates are high but only among patients of 70 years of age or more. In 1940, they were highest above 55; in 1941, rates between ages 15 and 54 were double tho e of the preceding year. Thus, even though excess mortality affected all ages, its strongest effects were felt from the older patients to the younger ones from 1939 to 1941. Trends according to diagnosis are difficult to interpret because of the change of classification in 1943. The patients suffered greatest hardship in public hospitals, which had no budget of their own and were run by the departements and lowest in private hospitals contributing to the public service, most of which were congregational and received religious funding. In 1941, standardised mortality ratios were more than three times higher than they were before the war. Conclusion.Comparison with people living in hospices shows that during the war mortality rates were 50% higher in these institutions, while they almost tripled in mental hospitals. The number of people who died of starvation and infectious diseases in mental hospitals from 1939 to 1945 can be estimated at about 45,500. However, mental patients were made specially vulnerable by circumstances that existed before the war in mental hospitals, in terms of food, hygiene and staffing, as suggested by an official document quoted in the paper.

(1999",Junk skepticism and recovered memory: A reply to Piper.,"Self-styled skeptics of recovered memory claim that no scientific evidence supports the claim that traumatic childhood events can be forgotten at the time, only to be remembered later in life. The archive of corroborated cases of recovered memory was created to document the growing number of cases that have been ignored or distorted, often by advisory board members of a prominent advocacy group for parents accused of sexual abuse, the so-called False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF). August Piper, an FMSF advisory board member, dismisses all of the cases in this archive in the name of skepticism. His argument provides an ideal vehicle for exploring the difference between true skepticism and junk skepticism. Piper's (1999/this issue) argument is characterized by three features of junk skepticism: evasion, distortion, and double standards. Piper's claims about specific cases are undocumented and inaccurate, and his argument demonstrates a phenomenon that has largely escaped notice in the debate over recovered memory: the use of rumor, innuendo, and false-accusation folklore to impugn those who have proven their cases in court. This article provides a detailed response to every case that Piper impugns, concluding with some observations about the politics of the false memory movement and the morality of tactics that apparently violate the ethical code in the profession of psychiatry. copyright Â© 1999, lawrence erlbaum associates, inc.",0,482
483,"Chen, G.-R. (2008","Recollecting memory, reviewing history: Trauma in Asian North American literature.","My dissertation focuses on representations of traumas in select eight Asian North American novels. I attempt to draw attention to this underrepresented issue of the Asian minority's traumatic experiences. Trauma in my discussion includes double consciousness, national trauma of war, white racism toward the Asian minority, children's perspectives on melancholia and loss, as well as psychosomatic trauma and violence on the female body. In Chapter One, I argue that in Jade Snow Wong's Fifth Chinese Daughter and Fae Myenne Ng's Bone, double consciousness is represented as a racial(ized) trauma that creates an ideological dichotomy between East and West, and constrains the identity of the Asian minority within the two. I propose that a multiple identity of racial minorities with performative possibilities in a nation-state should be taken into account. Chapter Two demonstrates how war causes trauma on the private body and memory of victims in Joy Kogawa's Obasan and Lan Cao's Monkey Bridge. War victims collect traumatic memories inside their bodies and recollect these memories repeatedly as corporeal evidence of political persecutions. Chapter Three discusses children's perspectives on melancholia and loss, and their racial/ethnic identification in Lois-Ann Yamanaka's Blu's Hanging and Wayson Choy's The Jade Peony. Both novels provide comical yet critical accounts about children's experience of losing loved ones, their discovery of sexuality, and their acceptance of racial reality during their maturation into adulthood. Chapter Four explores female trauma and transnational connections in Ruth L. Ozeki's My Year of Meats and Lydia Kwa's This Place Called Absence. In these novels, the trauma of the women characters suggests that the female body should be reconfigured beyond the biological function of reproductivity by the heteronormative standard. With the shared experience of violence, the women characters cross the temporal and spatial boundaries, and reflect global concerns about the autonomy of the female body.

484,"Chen, X., et al. (2015",Development and evaluation of the Brief Sexual Openness Scale-A construal level theory based approach.,"Obtaining reliable and valid data on sensitive questions represents a longstanding challenge for public health, particularly HIV research. To overcome the challenge, we assessed a construal level theory (CLT)-based novel method. The method was previously established and pilot-tested using the Brief Sexual Openness Scale (BSOS). This scale consists of five items assessing attitudes toward premarital sex, multiple sexual partners, homosexuality, extramarital sex, and commercial sex, all rated on a standard 5-point Likert scale. In addition to self-assessment, the participants were asked to assess rural residents, urban residents, and foreigners. The self-assessment plus the assessment of the three other groups were all used as subconstructs of one latent construct: sexual openness. The method was validated with data from 1,132 rural-to-urban migrants (mean age = 32.5, SD = 7.9; 49.6% female) recruited in China. Consistent with CLT, the Cronbach alpha of the BSOS as a conventional tool increased with social distance, from .81 for self-assessment to .97 for assessing foreigners. In addition to a satisfactory fit of the data to a one-factor model (CFI = .94, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .08), a common factor was separated from the four perspective factors (i.e., migrants' self-perspective and their perspectives of rural residents, urban residents and foreigners) through a trifactor modeling analysis (CFI = .95, TLI = .94, RMSEA = .08). Relative to its conventional form, CTL-based BSOS was more reliable (alpha: .96 vs .81) and valid in predicting sexual desire, frequency of dating, age of first sex, multiple sexual partners and STD history. This novel technique can be used to assess sexual openness, and possibly other sensitive questions among Chinese domestic migrants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,484

This double standard strongly reaffirms the property status of all women.

We first describe permissive attitude toward premarital sexual relations among never married male and female youth in their early 20s in Taiwan using large-scale data collected between 2004 and 2007. We then explore whether there is an association between gender, family characteristics, parental control and peer influence, and premarital sexual permissiveness among these youth. A vast body of literature documents female sexual conservativeness and a widening of this conservativeness through most Western regions. By way of contrast, few investigators have used an Asian youth population in order to understand female sexual conservativeness and its correlates. Although cross-sectional data cannot distinguish the temporal relationship between attitude and behavior, this chapter presents an association between permissive attitude and premarital sexual relations (engagement in romantic relationships and premarital sex) to demonstrate that attitudes tend to cluster and may correlate with behavior.

491,"Chin, J. L. (2011",Women and Leadership: Transforming Visions and Current Contexts.,"Women have increasingly moved toward greater gender equality at home and in the workplace. Yet, women are still underrepresented in leadership roles and still considered an anomaly compared to men when in high positions of leadership especially within institutions of higher education. In examining differences between how men and women lead, it is often less what they do than in the different experience they face when they lead. Stereotypic gender role expectations can constrain their leadership behaviors. Perceived incongruity between women and leadership roles pose obstacles to leadership and result in double binds, more negative performance appraisals, and different standards compared to those applied to men. It is increasingly clear that a gender neutral view of leadership is insufficient, and that we need to consider the influence of cultural worldviews and socialization on shaping leadership style. There is much to suggest that feminist leadership styles are intentionally different--more collaborative and transformational compared to men. This becomes more complex when we include dimensions of racial and ethnic diversity. We need to transform our views of leadership to promote more robust theories and diverse models of effective leadership. While current leadership theories favor transformational and collaborative leadership styles, organizational cultures often mirror social constructions of gender and ethnicity norms in society. Within the context of higher education institutions, there is often a tension between hierarchical and collaborative forms of leadership reflected in contradictory sets of practices. While women leaders may have an advantage in such contexts, they also face obstacles in needing to change organizational cultures that mirror social biases against women as leaders.

Both dose-response analyses and the determination of the strength of the reinforcing properties of opiates using a ""breakpoint"" analysis were examined. We found strong gender differences in the IV self-administration of two mu opiate agonists--heroin and morphine. At a standard fixed ratio (FR) of responding, females consumed significantly greater amounts of heroin and morphine than did males in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, females also showed much higher breakpoints than did males: the highest FR breakpoint achieved in females was more than double that observed in males and the frequency distribution of breakpoints was shifted significantly to the right in females when compared to males. These data collectively show that mu opiate agonists may serve as reinforcing agents in females over a broader dose range than males and that they also self-administer considerably more opiates on a milligram per kilogram basis. Finally, we conclude that they will also expend much greater effort in an operant conditioning task to obtain opiate reinforcement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,494

496,"Claes, H. I., et al. (2010",Understanding the effects of sildenafil treatment on erection maintenance and erection hardness.,"Introduction: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to attain and/or maintain penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Although intuitively related, the link between erection hardness and erection maintenance has not been formally established and quantified. Aim: To understand the components of erection maintenance through statistical modeling. Methods: Data from a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of fixed-dose sildenafil (100 or 50 mg, 8 weeks) with open-label extension of flexible-dose sildenafil (100 and 50 mg, 4 weeks) were analyzed. Erection maintenance was assessed with item 4 (how often erection was maintained) or item 5 (difficulty in maintaining erection) of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Erection hardness was assessed with the Erection Hardness Score. Main Outcome Measures: Longitudinal modeling estimated mean treatment differences averaged over the double-blind phase for sildenafil 100 mg vs. placebo and 50 mg vs. placebo. Statistical mediation analysis was applied to partition the effect of sildenafil (pooled into one treatment group) on erection maintenance directly and indirectly through erection hardness. Results: Longitudinal mean differences for sildenafil 100 and 50 mg vs. placebo were high (P < 0.0001 for each), with large standardized effect sizes (>0.8). Mediation modeling showed that sildenafil treatment affected maintenance directly as well as indirectly via erection hardness, when measured by IIEF item 4 (direct effect, 44.6%; indirect effect, 55.4%) or IIEF item 5 (direct effect, 56.9%; indirect effect, 43.1%). Conclusions: Sildenafil treatment significantly improved erection maintenance, a physiologic requirement for satisfactory sexual performance. According to our model, only approximately half of the effect of sildenafil on erection maintenance was estimated to be driven through direct effects. Rather, the effect of sildenafil on erection maintenance seems to be substantially driven by erection hardness. Therefore, achievement of optimal initial erection hardness appears to be an important treatment goal for enhancing erection maintenance and achieving successful ED treatment.

497,"Clark, J. (1995",Profeminist men's studies and gay ethics.,"Presents a critical perspective that allows gay men to view the sexual past and frequently AIDS-permeated present in fresh ways that enable a future for all. From this perspective, AIDS in the gay community can be understood as one catalyst among others for a shift from a narrow ethics of sexual freedom to an ethics of caring for one another, including caring for the ""casualties,"" at least in part, of the consequences of such sexual freedom. It is also realized that this process in gay ethics cannot simply sanction every gay/lesbian life-style or every aspect of the gay ghetto; it must instead provide and nurture a genuinely liberating vision. As such a vision begins to be articulated, doing gay/lesbian ethics will necessarily be connected to the real embodied lives of gay men (and lesbians), to experiences of continuing to live in a heterosexist and homophobic society. As the understanding of what it means to live ethically as gay men in particular has shifted from an emphasis on access to sexual freedom to the complexity of justice-seeking and the tasks of AIDS-related caregiving, commitments to oppose homophobia and heterosexism have broadened to include solidarity with other people and with the earth itself and the elimination of double-standards in every arena of life.

No recent studies have reported any significant concerns with respect to perceived stress levels in residency. We investigated the level of perceived stress, mental health and understanding and need for well-being resources among resident physicians in training programs in Alberta, Canada. Methods: A mail questionnaire was distributed to the entire resident membership of PARA during 2003 academic year. PARA represents each of the two medical schools in the province of Alberta. Results: In total 415 (51 %) residents participated in the study. Thirty-four percent of residents who responded to the survey reported their life as being stressful. Females reported stress more frequently than males (40% vs. 27%, p < 0.02). Time pressure was reported as the number one factor contributing to stress (44% of males and 57% of females). A considerable proportion of residents would change their specialty program (14%) and even more would not pursue medicine (22%) if given the opportunity to relive their career. Up to 55% of residents reported experiencing intimidation and harassment. Intimidation and harassment was strongly related to gender (12% of males and 38% of females). Many residents (17%) rated their mental health as fair or poor. This was more than double the amount reported in the Canadian Community Health Survey from the province (8%) or the country (7%). Residents highly valued their colleagues (67%), program directors (60%) and external psychiatrist/psychologist (49%) as well-being resources. Over one third of residents wished to have a career counselor (39%) and financial counselor (38%). Conclusion: Many Albertan residents experience significant stressors and emotional and mental health problems. Some of which differ among genders. This study can serve as a basis for future resource application, research and advocacy for overall improvements to well-being during residency training.

The consensus issue of ensuring facial unity subordinated the allegedly Crosscutting issue of analyzing sexuality, both straight and gay alike. This suppression has been challenged from two directions. Black women, both heterosexual and lesbian, have criticized the sexual politics of African American communities that leave women vulnerable to single motherhood and sexual assault. Black feminist and womanist projects have challenged Black community norms of a sexual double standard that punishes women for behaviors in which men are equally culpable. Black gays and lesbians have also criticized these same sexual politics that deny their tight to be fully accepted within churches, families, and other Black community organizations. Both groups of critics argue that ignoring the heterosexism that underpins Black patriarchy hinders the development of a progressive Black sexual politics. As Cathy Cohen and Tamara Jones contend, ""Black people need a liberatory politics that includes a deep understanding of how heterosexism operates as a system of oppression, both independently and in conjunction with other such systems. We need a black liberatory politics that affirms black lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender sexualities.

This is a longitudinal study assessing the direct effects of maternal depressive symptoms and older brothers' antisocial/depressive behavior on children's outcomes in adolescence. Indirect effects that were evaluated as potential mediators were ineffective parenting and sibling conflict. Standard Multiple Regression analyses revealed significant gender differences in response to familial psychopathology. Depressive symptoms in female children during adolescence were significantly predicted by maternal depressive symptoms and older brothers' antisocial and depressive behavior, compared to no such effects for male children. Antisocial behavior in both younger sisters and younger brothers during adolescence was significantly predicted by older brothers' antisocial behavior, but younger brothers were found to have higher mean levels of antisocial behavior. Ineffective parenting was not found to mediate the association between maternal depressive symptoms and negative child outcomes. Sibling conflict partially mediated the influence of an older brother's antisocial behavior on younger brothers' antisocial behavior, but did not do so for that of younger sisters. Female children appear to be more sensitive to pathological familial environments than male children, as evidenced by girls' responding with both depressive and antisocial behavior. While internalizing disorders are commonly observed in females, externalizing disorders are not. Thus, the combined influences of maternal dysphoria and older brothers' antisocial behavior place girls at ""double jeopardy"" for developing normative and non-normative gender-related disorders.

Despite the fact that IPV requires an interaction between two partners, the majority of the research focuses on individuals rather than the broader relationship context where such violence takes place. Using a sample of 422 married couples from rural Malawi, this study examined the dyadic environment of marital infidelity and two types of IPV victimization: sexual coercion and physical abuse. We considered both self-reported marital infidelity and perceived partner infidelity to assess how well partners knew each other and to compare their respective associations with IPV. Logistic regression was used to test for associations between self-reported marital infidelity and IPV. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine actor and partner effects of perceived partner infidelity on an individual's and their partner's experience of IPV. The results show that self-reported marital infidelity was not significantly associated with IPV for men or women. However, the perception of a partner's infidelity was significantly associated with both an individual's and their partner's risk for sexual coercion and physical abuse. Contrary to the ""sexual double standard"" hypothesis, women were not significantly more likely than men to report being physically abused when their partners suspected infidelity.

(2004","Constraints into Preferences: Gender, Status, and Emerging Career Aspirations.","This study presents an experimental evaluation of a model that describes the constraining effect of cultural beliefs about gender on the emerging career-relevant aspirations of men and women. The model specifies the conditions under which gender status beliefs evoke a gender-differentiated double standard for attributing performance to ability, which differentially biases the way men and women assess their own competence at tasks that are career relevant, controlling for actual ability. The model implies that, if men and women make different assessments of their own competence at career-relevant tasks, they will also form different aspirations for career paths and activities believed to require competence at these tasks. Data from the experiment support this model. In one condition, male and female undergraduate participants completed an experimental task after being exposed to a belief that men are better at this task. In this condition, male participants assessed their task ability higher than female participants did even though all were given the same scores. Males in this condition also had higher aspirations for career-relevant activities described as requiring competence at the task. No gender differences were found in either assessments or aspirations in a second condition where participants were instead exposed to a belief that men and women have equal task ability.

510,"Covey, L. S., et al. (2011",An exploration of site effects in a multisite trial of OROS-methylphenidate for smokers with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"Background: Multisite trials, the gold standard for conducting studies in community-based settings, can mask variability across sites resulting in misrepresentation of effects in specific sites. In a placebo-controlled trial of osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) as augmentation treatment for smokers with attention deficit hyperactivity/impulsivity disorder (ADHD), three types of sites were selected according to their clinical research specialty (ADHD, smoking cessation, and general mental health). Objective: Analysis was conducted to determine if clinical outcomes, that is, reduction in ADHD symptoms and smoking cessation rates, and the effect of treatment on these outcomes would differ by type of site. Method: A total of 255 adult smokers diagnosed with ADHD were enrolled in three clinic types: 72 in ADHD, 79 in tobacco dependence, and 104 in the mental health clinics. Results: The three site-types were similar in demographic characteristics, smoking history, baseline level of ADHD symptoms, and history of psychiatric illness. Site-type but not a site-type by treatment interaction predicted prolonged smoking abstinence. A significant three-way interaction of site-type, treatment, and time-predicted improvement in ADHD symptoms. Moderate to strong effects of OROS-MPH relative to placebo were observed in the mental health and the ADHD clinics; a weak effect was observed in the tobacco dependence clinics. Conclusion: OROS-MPH benefit varied by site for reducing ADHD symptoms but not for improving smoking abstinence. Scientific Significance: Assessment of site-type effects can indicate the generalizability of findings from multisite trials and should be routinely incorporated in the design of multisite trials.

This lesson provides a structure for, reflection on, and critique of contemporary gender stereotypes. Students explore the history and effects of gendered sexuality, which begin at birth and continue until death. Gendered sexuality refers to the ways in which we experience our sexuality based on the interaction of our biological sex and gender socialization. The story told in this lesson illuminates how expectations for males and females are based on an historical and cultural legacy that all too often goes unexamined. We describe this legacy as an historically constructed pair of binaries, called the Four Boxes of Gendered Sexuality: Good Girl vs. Bad Girl and Tough Guy vs. Sweet Guy.

Although adolescents' problem behavior has been studied for more than two decades (Jessor & Jessor, 1977), few researchers have examined what differences might exist between African-American parental practices and adolescents' problem behaviors in middle-income African-American families. This study examined the effects of parental monitoring and joint family decision-making on adolescents' problem behavior in a sample of middle-income African-American families. The influence of socioeconomic status, family composition, adolescents' age and gender was also examined. Using an existing data set from an ongoing study of middle-income African-American families (Smetana, 1996), data were analyzed on a sample of 89 adolescents between 11 and 14 years of age and their parents. A recursive path analysis was used to understand the effects of adolescents' problem behaviors on parental monitoring and joint family decision-making, and four family background variables-socioeconomic status, family composition, adolescents' gender and adolescents' age. Parental monitoring or joint family decision-making did not mediate the effects of family background variables on adolescents' problem behavior. Family composition did have a direct effect on adolescents' problem behavior when regressed with all independent variables. Contrary to expectations, adolescents living in intact families reported higher rates of problem behavior than their counterparts living in non-intact family arrangements. Although it was a relatively young sample of adolescents, adolescents' age and adolescents' gender had a marginally significant direct effect on adolescents' problem behavior when regressed with all independent variables. Results also indicated correlations between adolescents' gender and adolescents' problem behavior and between parental monitoring and adolescents' problem behavior.

516,"Crockett, N. (1992",‘You weren't taught that with the welding’: Lessons in sexuality in the second world war.,"War, especially the Second World War, has been seen as a time when relations between the sexes were problematic. This was attributed to the social disturbance caused by war through mobilisation for war work and the destructive effects of bombing. Connections between wartime disturbance and sex were made through rumour and innuendo, mostly about women's loose morals, and also in official enquiries. Some male historians have read such evidence as indicating the sexual liberation of women in wartime. Feminist historians in contrast have reacted to it in three more critical ways. They have played it down by emphasising continuity, they have exposed the double standard in the view that women were responsible, and they have asked whether varieties of sexual harassment should be seen as men seeking to control women at a time when women appeared to have more power than usual. In this paper we explore what women themselves felt was happening, using oral history evidence from 40 women. We argue that this subjective evidence challenges some of the constructions of sexuality in wartime discussed in the first part of the paper, most obviously the official discourse of women as immoral and simplistic views of the war as sexually liberating for women, but also perspectives which over-emphasise control and regulation. The accounts collected emphasise a wide variety of responses which include conformity to traditional norms of sexual behaviour and femininity, as well as rejection of such norms and a refusal to be subordinated.

517,"Crozier, I. (2008",Nineteenth-century british psychiatric Writing about homosexuality before Havelock Ellis: The missing story.,"Recent accounts of the emergence of sexology have addressed the role played by homosexuals and sexual radicals in framing the questions posed by psychiatrists. This work has focused largely upon American and Continental psychiatry (with regard to homosexuality), with attention to British sexologists sometimes being tied to contemporary feminist concerns with the sexual double standard. In both cases, psychiatrists are shown to be following other social movements. In the existing work, British psychiatrists of the nineteenth century who wrote about homosexuality have been largely ignored because it appears to have been assumed that very little material existed prior to Havelock Ellis' Sexual Inversion (1897). In this article, I demonstrate that there were a number of British psychiatric discussions of sexual perversions, and that these discourses show an engagement on the part of British psychiatrists with the theoretical issues that occupied their (mostly) Teutonic colleagues, rather than evidence of any other external driving force behind the production of sexological discourses. These sexological texts are either original papers, or reviews of Continental sources, both of which illustrate the importation of sexological ideas into Britain before the writing of Havelock Ellis.

(2013",The effect of four intervention programs on standardized test scores by gender.,"This quantitative correlational study involved the analysis, by gender, of the effect of four intervention programs at an Arizona middle school as seen on Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS) test scores. These four intervention programs included: Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), a planner stamping system, a World Studies curriculum, and a double-block math class implemented as a result of reaching full Title I status. The problem researched was the disparity in Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS) test scores between males and females. The purpose was to analyze the relationship between the programs and the continuing gender gap on AIMS test scores. The research questions investigated the effect the intervention programs had, if any, on subsequent AIMS test scores. The importance of an educated population in increasing economic viability was the theoretical framework for this study. A univariate ANOVA using SPSS version 20.0 was performed on student test scores to determine the significance of the relationship between the intervention program and the student test scores, by gender. Critical analysis of the data revealed that no single intervention program increased test scores for males or females in all three tested areas (math, reading, or writing). However, for the AVID program, significance in effect was found for math but not for reading and writing. For the planner stamping program, significance in effect was found for writing and reading, but not for math. For the world studies curriculum, significance in effect was found for writing, but not for math or reading. The double-block math program indicated no significance of effect for gender, but graphs indicate a significance of effect for males that is negated by the significance of effect for females. Key results of this study indicate a need for further examination of these intervention programs and the effect on test scores, by gender, in an effort to eliminate the gender gap as seen on AIMS test scores.

Aim We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Methods A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ospemifene for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. The search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Main Outcome Measures Six publications involving a total of 1,772 patients were used in the analysis, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were short-term (12 weeks) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo and three RCTs that were long-term (1 year) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo. Results For the comparison of short-term ospemifene with placebo, parabasal cells (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = -37.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI = 7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001) indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo. For the comparison of long-term ospemifene with placebo, endometrial thickness (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.23, P = 0.00001), treatment emergent adverse event, discontinuations due to adverse event, and serious adverse event indicated that ospemifene was generally safe.

I consider the specific topics of gender, sexuality, emotion, and relationships with significant others to demonstrate how many athletes experience a ""bifurcated consciousness"" and how they identify and negotiate the gendered double standards evident in sport. Using these themes, I show athletes' conscious and unconscious attempts to render gender invisible in sport, i.e., I show how many athletes construct sport as ""genderless"" at the same time that their experiences are highly gendered.

The relationship between psychological maturity as measured by sex role attitudes, sexual behavior, and contraceptive use is examined. When attitudes of sexual permissiveness were controlled for statistically, it was found that non-virgins held relatively stereotyped sex role attitudes. That is, the sexually active women were highly likely to agree with statements describing differences between the sexes in terms of traditional occupations and family function. In contrast, virgins who believed that they were not presently ready to have sexual intercourse but who considered that they might be some time before marriage held relatively non-stereotyped sex role images. These virgins seemed to have a more mature sex role attitude than their sexually active peers. Virgins who denied that they would experience pre-marital intercourse were found to hold sex role attitudes more extremely stereotyped than the sexually active women. Women who were 16 years or older at first intercourse were better current contraceptors than women who had been 15 years or younger at first intercourse. There was no relationship between current age and birth control use. These findings have implications for theories of sex role development and the provision of fertility planning services to teenagers. Data from a 1975 survey of 369 females and 325 males aged 16-17 were analyzed to shed light on the relationship between the maturity of adolescent women and their sexual behavior and contraceptive practice. A straightforward decision-making process was found among males, but more complicated influences exist for females. When the data were submitted to regression and chi-squared analyses, it was found that whereas sexually active adolescents had more liberal sexual attitudes than virgins, their sex role attitudes were more stereotypical than virgins. Then the 2 groups were subdivided into virgins who did not intend to have premarital intercourse (20%); virgins who planned or considered premarital intercourse (40%); adolescents who experienced intercourse prior to age 16 (20%); and those who experienced intercourse after age 16 (20%). It was found that the virgins who did not intend to have premarital intercourse held the most stereotypical sex role attitudes, followed by sexually active women, and that virgins planning or considering intercourse held the least stereotypical views of all. It is suggested that this occurred because these adolescents were more mature and had resolved sexual identity problems earlier without resorting to intercourse. Birth control use was found to be more effective among the adolescents who experienced intercourse after age 16. Further studies are underway to test the hypotheses that the more mature a woman is when she experiences intercourse, the more likely it is that her development will be enhanced and that her contraceptive behavior will be effective.",0,524

Material and Method: The study included 150 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who have been hospitalized due to a major depressive disorder according to the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV classification, at the Psychiatric Clinic in Novi Sad, Serbia. Patients with comorbid physical or other mental disorders were not included. Within the research process, during the first day of hospitalization, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with 21 items was administered, while 12 other symptoms of depression (specific quality of the depression, pessimism, stability of depression to environmental influences, ideas of impoverishment, worthlessness, blaming of others, social isolation, anhedonia, monoideism, self-pity, dependence on others, and manipulativeness) were assessed using the BPRS, MADRS, SADS, SADD and AMPDP scales by the examining psychiatrist. A t-test for significance of differences in the age structure of men and women was performed in the statistical analysis, which indicated that this is a homogeneous group, while the structure of gender differences in the clinical picture of depression was examined by discriminant analysis, in which gender was an independent variable, while the examined depressive symptoms were the dependent variables. Results: The results showed a statistically significant structure of gender differences in the clinical picture of depression, which is reflected in the existence of two types of depression, hypothetically called: existential depression characteristic to men and anxious-somatic depression characteristic to women. Conclusion: The determined existence of gender differences in depressive symptoms and the clinical presentation of depression in this and other studies, as well as the data on double the prevalence of depression in women and the gender differences in the responses to antidepressant medications, are the facts that point out the need for a gender-specific approach to the evaluation and treatment of depression.

That is, cross-sex-typed traits, occupations, behaviors, and responsibilities were not seen as less desirable for males than for females. Second, this research found a discrepancy between subjects' personal gender-role attitudes and their perceptions of their peers' attitudes; high school and college students believe that they hold less traditional attitudes than do their peers. Some possible explanations for this finding are discussed. Finally, it was demonstrated that one's subjective gender-role environment, as measured by one's perceptions of the gender-role attitudes of one's peers, can have negative consequences for both males and females. The more traditional one perceives one's peers to be, the higher one's level of depressive symptoms. In addition, subjects' personal gender-role attitudes were shown to be affected by their perceptions of their peers' attitudes. This is rather striking, since subjects were misperceiving the attitudes of their peers. Implications of all of these results are discussed.

(2013",Change to either a nonandrogenic or androgenic progestin-containing oral contraceptive preparation is associated with improved sexual function in women with oral contraceptive-associated sexual dysfunction.,"Introduction: It is a commonly held belief that combined oral contraceptive (COC) pills containing an androgenic progestin may be less likely to impair sexual function than COCs containing an anti-androgenic progestin. Aim: The study aims to compare the effects of a COC containing a progestin with an anti-androgenic profile (estradiol valerate [E2V]/dienogest [DNG]) to that of one with an androgenic progestin (ethinyl estradiol [EE]/ levonorgestrel [LNG]) on sexual function in women with COC-associated sexual dysfunction. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority study, women with COC-associated female sexual dysfunction (FSD) were randomized to E2V/DNG or EE/LNG for six cycles. The primary outcome was the change in the sum of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) desire and arousal component scores between baseline and cycle 6. Secondary outcome measures included changes to the FSFI domains, the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS-R), Vaginal Health Assessment, the Atrophy Symptom Questionnaire, and the Psychological General Well Being Index over six treatment cycles. Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome is the change in the sum of FSFI desire and arousal component scores between baseline and cycle 6. Results: Of 276 women screened, 213 received treatment and 191 completed the study. The mean increase in the sum of FSFI desire and arousal component scores was 5.90 (standard deviation [SD] 5.45) for E2V/DNG and 5.79 (SD 6.17) for EE/LNG (change from baseline P < 0.0001, both groups). Both treatments showed equal efficacy and were associated with improvements in all domains of the FSFI, with no between-group differences. Both COCs reduced the distress associated with FSD, as indicated by reduced FSDS-R scores. Conclusion: In women with COC-associated FSD, switching to either E2V/DNG or EE/LNG was associated with equivalent improvements in symptoms, challenging the perception that COCs containing anti-androgenic progestins have a detrimental effect on sexual function relative to those containing androgenic progestins.

(2015","I cheat because i can: Power, sexism, and approval of infidelity.","This study examined the moderating role of ambivalent sexism in the relationship between power and approval of infidelity. College students were randomly assigned to high- and low-power conditions and completed measures assessing their perceived power, endorsed sexism toward men and women, and approval of their own possible infidelity. It was hypothesized that the association between perceived power and permissive attitudes toward infidelity would vary according to participants' endorsement of hostile and benevolent sexism. The hypotheses were partially supported, and the results revealed the importance of both participant gender and sexism as predictors of attitudes toward infidelity. Hostile sexism toward men and women moderated the relationship between power and approval of uncommitted sexual relationships and infidelity. For women, hostile sexism toward men was positively associated with permissive attitudes toward infidelity. For men, hostile sexism toward women was positively associated with approval of uncommitted sexual relationships. In addition, while hostile sexism toward women predicted approval of uncommitted sexual relationships, hostile sexism toward men was associated with approval of infidelity. Exploratory analyses examining participant's reported narcissism were also conducted. For men, hostile sexism toward women marginally moderated the relationship between narcissism and approval of uncommitted sexual relationships. These findings partially support an integrated model of infidelity that accounts for attitudinal differences as well as macro-level issues, such as gendered power.

539,"De Bock, T. and P. Van Kenhove (2011",Double standards: The role of techniques of neutralization.,"Despite the growing number of studies examining consumers' perceptions of unethical corporate and consumer practices, research examining the apparent double standard existing between what consumers perceive as acceptable corporate behaviour and what they believe are acceptable consumer practices remains scarce. Contradictory, double standards are often quoted by other researchers as a major stream in ethical literature. The few studies dealing with this topic as well as this study indicate that people rate corporate unethical actions as less admissible compared to similar consumer misactions. However, little is known about the processes underlying these double standards. This research investigates whether the techniques of neutralization could provide a meaningful way of approaching this phenomenon. Findings indicate that the higher the extent to which people agree with arguments explaining away the misbehaviour instigated by consumers or business, the more they tolerate these questionable consumer and corporate practices. Furthermore and more importantly, these techniques give an answer on the question why people judge business (representatives) more harshly than consumers. More specifically, results show that the same respondents who justify questionable consumer actions to a certain degree, condone the same misbehaviours instigated by business (representatives) to a much lesser extent. In this way, the techniques of neutralization concern a process explaining the double standard phenomenon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,539

(2012",Analysis of sensitive questions across cultures: An application of multigroup item randomized response theory to sexual attitudes and behavior.,"Answers to sensitive questions are prone to social desirability bias. If not properly addressed, the validity of the research can be suspect. This article presents multigroup item randomized response theory (MIRRT) to measure self-reported sensitive topics across cultures. The method was specifically developed to reduce social desirability bias by making an a priori change in the design of the survey. The change involves the use of a randomization device (e.g., a die) that preserves participants' privacy at the item level. In cases where multiple items measure a higher level theoretical construct, the researcher could still make inferences at the individual level. The method can correct for under- and overreporting, even if both occur in a sample of individuals or across nations. We present and illustrate MIRRT in a nontechnical manner, provide WinBugs software code so that researchers can directly implement it, and present 2 cross-national studies in which it was applied. The first study compared nonstudent samples from 2 countries (total n = 927) on permissive sexual attitudes and risky sexual behavior and related these to individual-level characteristics such as the Big Five personality traits. The second study compared nonstudent samples from 17 countries (total n = 6,195) on risky sexual behavior and related these to individual-level characteristics, such as gender and age, and to country-level characteristics, such as sex ratio.

Based on their belief that sexual attraction or passion is a primary criterion of romantic love, the authors hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between the importance of romantic love and social indicators of sexual equality. P. Rosenblatt's (1966) 11-point rating scale of romantic love was used to test this hypothesis from 75 societies originally tested by G. J. Broude and S. J. Greene (1976). Societies that allowed premarital and extramarital sex for both males and females rate romantic love significantly higher than societies that have a double standard or have strong sanctions against female sexuality out of wedlock. It is concluded that the type of sanction against female sexuality is the critical factor for predicting the cultural importance of romantic love as a basis for marriage.

This mixed methods study was conducted to examine the extent to which young people endorse gender double-standards for alcohol use - i.e., less acceptance of drinking and drunkenness in women than men - and how these influence men's and women's alcohol consumption. A sample of 731 English university students completed an online survey of gender role attitudes, beliefs about the gendered nature of alcohol use and recent alcohol consumption. Sixteen participants were then purposively selected for individual interviews: eight women and men with the most egalitarian gender role beliefs, and eight women and men with the least egalitarian beliefs. The two sets of data revealed that although there were few sex differences in actual levels of drinking or drunkenness, gender double-standards for alcohol use persist: beer drinking, binge drinking and public drunkenness tended to be perceived as masculine, and even the most egalitarian respondents were more judgemental of women's drinking. Participants modified their drinking style so as to maintain a desired gender identity.

While many antidotes have been proposed, few have been subjected to double-blind trials. Some evidence has suggested that bupropion may be an effective antidote for SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. In this double-blind trial, the efficacy of a standard dose of bupropion sustained release (SR) is evaluated in the treatment of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Method: Patients with a history of SSRI-induced sexual side effects were randomly assigned to adjunctive treatment with either bupropion SR 150 mg daily or placebo for 6 weeks. Assessments of sexual function and interest included the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), Brief Index of Sexual Functioning, and a 10-point visual analogue scale. Efficacy was defined as a 50% improvement on the ASEX at the end of 6 weeks. Data were collected from January 1999 to March 2001. Results: Forty-one patients entered the study and completed the 6-week trial. No significant differences were seen between placebo and bupropion SR on the ASEX or on any measure of sexual functioning at the end of the trial. Conclusion: A fixed dose of 150 mg/day of bupropion SR taken in the morning does not appear to be effective in the treatment of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.

Couples characterized by more traditional attitudes toward gender roles were significantly less satisfied than others.

Neither view acknowledges how Howells appropriated a central tenet of genteel society - domesticity - as ground for a pragmatic appraisal of fine art under the impress of capitalism. Especially in his fictional descriptions of painting and illustration, Howells delineates how disinterested rationales of fine art like aestheticism depend upon the aesthetic equivalent of the sexual double-standard: women are valorized as moral authorities but denigrated as artists so that men can make art without the stigma of commercialism. Through doubly gendered artists and feminized artistic practices, Howells critiques the capitalist logic that reduces aesthetics to an epiphe-nomenon of the market or to self-referential theories of the artwork. He demonstrates instead that art objects are ultimately defined by the ethical affiliations they bear to other social and aesthetic practices. In his criticism and fiction of the late 1880s and early 1890s, then, femininity emerges as a crucial rhetorical strategy that enabled Howells to represent and rationalize the paradoxical nature of fine art in capitalist society.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 47 heterosexual couples (total n = 94) received oxytocin or placebo intranasally prior to instructed couple conflict. Participants' behavior was videotaped and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), a measure of sympathetic activity, and emotional arousal were repeatedly measured during the experiment. Oxytocin significantly reduced sAA during couple conflict in women, whereas men showed increases in sAA levels (sex x group interaction: B = -49.36, t = -2.68, P = 0.009). In men, these increases were related to augmented emotional arousal (r = 0.286, P = 0.028) and more positive behavior (r = 0.291, P = 0.026), whereas there was no such association in women.

We tested the efficacy of varenicline in achieving abstinence from all tobacco use among waterpipe smokers. Design Two-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centre (n = 4), individually randomized trial with follow-up to 25 weeks. Settings District general hospitals and catchment communities within four districts of Punjab, Pakistan. Participants Adult daily waterpipe smokers (n = 510; 253 in varenicline and 257 in placebo arms), who were interested in quitting, were recruited and analysed between March and November 2016. Of these, 220 (87%) in the varenicline and 239 (93%) in the placebo arms completed all follow-ups. Participants were on average aged 49 [standard deviation (SD) = 15.2] years, daily smokers and smoked for the last 27 (SD = 15.9) years. More than half (261, 51.2%) also smoked cigarettes. Intervention and comparator All trial participants received two structured sessions of behavioural support (of 30 and 10 minutes) one at the time of registration and the other 1 week later. Participants were randomized to varenicline (active arm) and placebo (control arm) stratified on district, sex and concomitant cigarette smoking. Varenicline and placebo were dispensed as identical unlabelled tablets for 12 weeks: 0.5 mg for 1 week (once on days 1-3, twice on days 4-7) and 1 mg for the subsequent 11 weeks (twice daily). Measurements The trial participants were followed-up for a period of 25 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome was 7-day repeated point prevalence abstinence from all forms of tobacco, self-reported at each of weeks 5, 12 and 25, verified by carbon-monoxide cut-off < 10 parts per million. Findings No evidence of statistically significant difference in repeated point prevalence abstinence between the varenicline (12 of 253; 4.7%) and placebo (11 of 257; 4.3%) arms (relative risk = 1.11, 95% confidence interval = 0.50-2.47, P = 0.80) was observed (Bayes factor = 0.048). Adverse events reported in 27 participants were 34 (15 in varenicline and 19 in placebo); none was serious. Conclusions Varenicline was not more effective than placebo in aiding cessation of tobacco use in long-term daily waterpipe smokers.

564,"Dolin, T. (2016","A Moabite among the Israelities: Ruth, Religion, and the Victorian Social Novel.","When Elizabeth Gaskell's reputation was revived in the 1980s and 1990s, Ruth was reread along with the factory novels, and uneasily assimilated to the secular socio-economistic, feminist Gaskell that emerged at that time. Ruth's overt religiosity was necessarily downplayed, however, and it was reconstructed as a social novel about the sexual double standard. What happened to religion? This article argues that it is effaced by historicism: Gaskell's and ours. Ruth was Gaskell's attempt to reimagine social fiction; but it was only a first stage, a transitional work that looks towards a different kind of ethical fiction-reading subject who will be a different kind of agent in social change. Rather than proposing a naively transcendental solution to the conditions of history and ideology, whether in the Romantic form of feeling or the Christian form of faith in God, Gaskell offers an explanatory fable of social renewal through the energy of the outsider. Ruth is like her Moabite namesake: she foregoes her own religious identity as a devout Protestant Christian to take up a greater genealogical imperative, to instate the lineage of a new secular religion. In this respect, the fate of Ruth itself has been somewhat akin to the fate of the biblical heroine. For it too stands as a kind of lone Moabite among the Israelites, an outsider fiction seeking religion's readmission to the vital debates about feminism, social realism, and the role of fiction in social change, and promising that it can go whither they go.

Fifty-nine healthy participants were randomly assigned to either receive 25 mg cortisol or a placebo 45 min before retrieval in a standardized memory test procedure. There was no global effect of cortisol on either verbal or nonverbal memory. However, a specific negative effect on free recall of associative verbal material appeared. In addition, high responders (salivary cortisol concentration > 68.25 nmol/L) exhibited impaired verbal memory compared with low responders (< 68.25 nmol/L). The results suggest specific nonlinear effects of cortisol on declarative memory retrieval, which appear to be more pronounced for verbal material.

This study combined 2 types of longitudinal modeling, mean-level development and cross-lagged panel modeling, to examine (a) developmental patterns in adolescents' SEIM use, permissive sexual attitudes, and experience with sexual behavior, as well as whether these developments are related; and (b) longitudinal directionality of associations between SEIM use on the 1 hand and permissive sexual attitudes and sexual behavior on the other hand. We used 4-wave longitudinal data from 1,132 7th through 10th grade Dutch adolescents (Mage T1 = 13.95; 52.7% boys) and estimated multigroup models to test for moderation by gender. Mean-level developmental trajectories showed that boys occasionally and increasingly used SEIM over the 18-month study period, which co-occurred with increases in their permissive attitudes and their experience with sexual behavior. Cross-lagged panel models revealed unidirectional effects from boys' SEIM use on their subsequent endorsement of permissive attitudes, but no consistent directional effects between their SEIM use and sexual behavior. Girls showed a similar pattern of increases in experience with sexual behavior, but their SEIM use was consistently low and their endorsement of permissive sexual attitudes decreased over the 18-month study period. In contrast to boys, girls' SEIM use was not longitudinally related to their sexual attitudes and behavior. Theoretical and practical implications of these gender-specific findings are discussed.

A combination of latent class growth analysis on SEIM use and latent growth curve analysis on sexual behavior was used on four-wave longitudinal data of 787 eighth through tenth grade Dutch adolescents. Among boys, four SEIM use trajectories were identified, which were labeled Nonuse/Infrequent Use, Strongly Increasing Use, Occasional Use, and Decreasing Use. Among girls, a large Stable Nonuse/Infrequent Use and smaller Strongly Increasing Use and Stable Occasional Use trajectories were distinguished. Higher initial levels and/or stronger increases in SEIM use were predicted by demographic, social contextual, personal, and media use characteristics, including a stronger sexual interest, a higher degree of perceived realism regarding sexualized Internet content, and more permissive sexual attitudes. Moreover, initial levels of and, to some extent, developmental changes in sexual behavior varied for boys and girls in the different SEIM use trajectories. Whereas some adolescents showed concurrent low levels, or parallel strong increases in SEIM use and sexual behavior, a subgroup of boys decreased their SEIM use while increasing their sexual behavior.

Coates (1999",The impact of gender on parent-child sexuality communication: Has anything changed?,"One strategy to improve sexual health outcomes for adolescents is parent-child sexuality education in the home, which has been shown in several studies to promote a positive approach to sexuality. As part of a larger study, this paper discusses Australian research on the significance of gender in the teaching Practices of parents engaged in sexuality communication in the home. The descriptive cross-sectional design involved a survey of 371 parents of preschool and preadolescent children. Consistent with previous studies, results showed that mothers communicated more than fathers did with their children. Although both mothers and fathers communicated equally with preschool sons and daughters, by preadolescence both discussed sexuality more with their sons than with their daughters. The findings also suggest that parents continue traditional roles in parenting, with mothers and fathers supporting a double standard in society. Parents communicated with sons about topics related to sexual exploration while they discussed physiological and protective issues with daughters. Amid the information age of the 1990s it seems that little has changed in home-based sexuality education, with minimal information offered and the influence of gender significant.

Using the difference in the mean descriptions of the healthy adult male and female as the dependent measure, an analysis of variance procedure indicated that there was a significant interaction between the sex of rater and sex role identity variables, with the androgynous male group reporting the least discrepancy between the two descriptions. Further analysis of the data revealed that while the sex by sex role groups varied in the relative amount of difference between these two descriptions, in absolute terms all groups described the healthy adult male as significantly different from the healthy adult female. Implications of this research were discussed in relation to the existence of a perceptual double standard in conceptions of psychological health, in relation to the effects that information levels have on producing such a double standard, and in relation to the consequences of a perceptual double standard for sex-role stereotyping in psychotherapy.

570,"Dreyer, Y. (2011",Gender critique on the narrator's androcentric point of view of women in Matthew's gospel.,"The article, from a gender-sensitive perspective, is critical of patriarchal values that are harmful to women and other non-dominant groups. When the focus on women and women's roles is usurped by male control, the androcentric self-interest of interpreters and authors becomes apparent. This is still the case in present-day theological studies, but is especially prevalent in premodern biblical writings, of which the Gospel of Matthew is an example. Recent mainstream Jesus studies demonstrate that women were welcomed in an 'egalitarian' way in the community of the first followers of Jesus. Women's contribution to the first Christian faith community is highlighted. This stands in stark contrast to the silencing and invisibility of women in the surrounding patriarchal world of the ancient Middle East. Although Matthew does view women and other formerly excluded people as part of the faith community and equal recipients of God's love, they are never treated as equal participants. The article focuses on three issues concerning the narrator's point of view, namely that (1) women fulfilled a supporting, rather than an initiating role (Mt 1-2; 9:18-26; 15:21-28), (2) double standards were applied to male and female sexuality and women's sexuality was regarded with prejudice (Mt 5:29-32; 19:2-12) and (3) women were seemingly given the opportunity to live 'authentically' as human beings, but in actual fact they could do so only if this 'authenticity' was sanctioned by men (Mt 20:20-23; 27:38; 27:56).

It is noted that student activists have split the university on moral grounds, charging that universities are ""structurally"" racist, sexist, homophobic, and class biased. It is argued that, while generally unrestrained by administration and unopposed by senior faculty, junior faculty activists, in their eagerness to create a multicultural community, demand and receive changes in admissions and other policies on the basis of race and gender categories, rather than intellectual merit. Case histories examine the admissions policies of the University of California at Berkeley, the multiculturalism at Stanford University, the roots of protest at Howard University, racial incidents at the University of Michigan, the subversion of academic standards at Duke University, and the teaching of race and gender at Harvard University. Each case is used to document the counter-productive effects of preferential treatment and official double standards on minorities themselves, and argues that university policies designed to foster pluralism, diversity, tolerance, and multiculturalism in fact promote ignorance, intolerance, and racism. Finally, it is noted that the rhetorical excesses and coercive tactics of the ""politically correct"" have done much to drive reflective liberals into the ranks of a conservative opposition.

572,"Dunbar, T. M. (1995",Women who sexually molest female children.,"Research estimates that 23 percent of the United States' female population has been sexually abused in childhood, and that 5 percent, or 1.5 million, were molested by women (Allen, 1990: Finkelhor, 1984; Russell, 1986). A comparative analysis was made of six studies on women who sexually molested prepubertal female children. Findings were supported by individual case studies from various authors. The organization of male and female etiologies for sexual abuse suggest that both genders share characteristic similarities, yet have gender circumstantial differences that influence the development of adult molesting behavior. The etiologies for male sexual abuse were presented using Finkelhor and Araji's (1986) four-factor model on pedophilia (emotional congruence, sexual arousal, blockage, and inhibition). The etiologies of female sexual abuse were organized using Travin, Cullen, and Protter's (1990) classifications of biological, learned/behavioral and psychodynamic factors. A theoretical discussion was designed using reported learned/behavioral and psychodynamic case study observations of female molesting behavior. Examination of the findings emphasize the importance of primary mother-daughter attachment, early female identity formation, and female socialization as influencers of later female molesting behavior. Analysis of the six core studies also suggests that the social recognition of female sex offenders was affected by the Criminal Justice System's use of a double standard in convicting male and female abusers. The sentencing of such female sex offenders appears to be derogatory to the cultural role that women are stereotyped to achieve. The overall findings contribute to the understanding of women who sexually molest female children.

(2017","The Relationship Between Sexual History, Bullying Victimization, and Poor Mental Health Outcomes Among Heterosexual and Sexual Minority High School Students: A Feminist Perspective.","This study uses a feminist theoretical framework to extend the literature on the relationship between sexual history, bullying victimization, and poor mental health outcomes. First, we examined whether an association between the sexual double standard and bullying victimization would apply to sexual minority youth the same way it applies to heterosexual youth. A second aim was to assess whether sexual minority boys, typically stereotyped as effeminate, would report the highest odds of bullying victimization. A third and final aim of our study was to look at the joint effect of sex and sexual intercourse on depression and suicidal ideation. Our analytic sample (N = 9,300) was from the 2009, 2011, and 2013 Rhode Island Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Findings demonstrated that heterosexual girls who engaged in sexual intercourse had significantly higher adjusted odds of bullying victimization than heterosexual boys who engaged in the same behavior. Similar results were not found for sexual minority adolescents, suggesting the sexual double standard may not apply to sexual minority adolescents in the same way it applies to heterosexual adolescents. Consistent with our second hypothesis, sexual minority boys reported the highest odds of being recently bullied compared with heterosexual boys. Among students who were recently bullied, sexual minority girls displayed the highest adjusted odds of recent depression and suicidal ideation. Our study demonstrated that using a feminist theoretical framework broadens our understanding of why girls and sexual minority boys are particularly vulnerable to bullying victimization and the sequel of depression and suicidal ideation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if the sexual double standard could explain gender differences in bullying victimization among adolescents and the extent to which that relationship correlated with depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: Analyses were conducted using a sample of high school students (n = 13,065) from the 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional and national school-based survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data were assessed using multiple logistic regression, gender-stratified analyses, and interaction terms. Findings: Students who engaged in sexual intercourse (sexually active) had higher odds of being bullied. When this association was stratified by gender, odds of being bullying increased for girls (odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.58-2.13) and decreased for boys (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.77-1.16). Sexually active students who were bullied also displayed more than five times (OR, 5.65; 95% CI, 4.71-6.78) the adjusted odds of depression and three times (adjusted OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 2.65-4.32) the adjusted odds of suicidal ideation compared with students who reported neither of those behavioral characteristics. When stratified by gender, girls had slightly higher odds of depression and suicidal ideation but overall, the odds remained strong for both genders. Conclusions: Results provide some evidence that a sexual double standard exists and may play a prominent role in bullying victimization among girls. Therefore, addressing the sexual double may be important to consider when tailoring school bullying intervention programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,574

However, the causes of death in a complete incidence cohort and mortality patterns over time compared with the general population are unknown. Method All 2723 patients who presented for the first time with psychosis in three defined catchment areas of the UK in London (1965-2004, n=2056), Nottingham (1997-1999, n=203) and Dumfries and Galloway (1979-1998, n=464) were traced after a mean of 11.5 years follow-up and death certificates were obtained. Data analysis was by indirect standardization. Results The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for first-contact psychosis was 184 [95% confidence interval (CI) 167-202]. Most deaths (84.2%, 374/444) were from natural causes, although suicide had the highest SMR (1165, 95% CI 873-1524). Diseases of the respiratory system and infectious diseases had the highest SMR of the natural causes of death (232, 95% CI 183-291). The risk of death from diseases of the circulatory system was also elevated compared with the general population (SMR 139, 95% CI 117-164) whereas there was no such difference for neoplasms (SMR 111, 95% CI 86-141). There was strong evidence that the mortality gap compared with the general population for all causes of death (p<0.001) and all natural causes (p=0.01) increased over the four decades of the study. There was weak evidence that cardiovascular deaths may be increasing relative to the general population (p=0.07). Conclusions People with first-contact psychosis have an overall mortality risk that is nearly double that of the general population. Most excess deaths are from natural causes. The widening of the mortality gap over the last four decades should be of concern to all clinicians involved in delivering healthcare. Â© 2011 Cambridge University Press.",0,576
577,"Dwairy, M. (2004",Parenting Styles and Mental Health of Palestinian–Arab Adolescents in Israel.,"The relationship between three parenting styles (authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative) and the mental health of Arab adolescents was tested. It was hypothesized that parenting style toward boys would differ from that towards girls, psychological adjustment of girls would differ from that of boys, and that the authoritarian style applied within the authoritarian Arab society is not associated with poor psychological adjustment. The Parental Authority Questionnaire, Child Attitude Toward Parents, Lipsitt's Self-Concept Scale for Children, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Psychological State Scale were administered to 431 Arab adolescents. Sex comparison revealed that the parenting style with regard to girls tends to be more authoritative and less authoritarian than with regard to boys. Girls scored higher than boys on identity disorder, anxiety disorder, and depression scales, whereas boys scored higher than girls on the behavior disorder scale. There was no significant relationship between the authoritarian parenting style and the mental health measures. A significant positive relationship exists between the authoritative parenting style and the mental health of children. Among boys, the permissive parenting style was associated with negative attitudes towards parents, lower self-esteem and increased identity, anxiety, phobia, depressive, and conduct disorders. It seems, therefore, that the effect of parenting style is culturally and gender dependent rather than universal. Â© 2004, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.",0,577

Participants were presented with standardized pictures of parent-child dyads, romantic couples engaging in non-erotic or explicit sexual activities, and non-social pictures while we assessed pupil dilation and eye focus on specific pre-defined areas of interest. Multilevel analyses suggest that during the initial presentation, OT increased pupil dilation towards all categories of stimuli and led the eye focus towards the eyes and body regions, followed by a strong decrease in pupil dilation and fixations at the second session.These carry-over effects indicate that hormonal treatment at an initial contact to social stimuli can determine how these stimuli are processed later. These results might have implications for OT as a treatment in interventions with repeated exposure to social material. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,582

Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor approved for treating ED, is currently being evaluated for treating BPH-LUTS. Aims: This multinational Phase 3 study assessed effects of tadalafil 2.5 or 5 mg once daily on ED and BPH-LUTS in men with both conditions during 12 weeks of double-blinded therapy. Methods: Men were >=45 years old, sexually active, and experiencing ED for >=3 months and BPH-LUTS for >6 months. Randomization (baseline) followed a 4-week placebo lead-in; changes from baseline were assessed via analysis of covariance and compared to placebo. A gatekeeping procedure controlled for multiple comparisons of co-primary and key secondary measures at end point (last post-baseline observation). Main Outcome Measures: The co-primary measures were the International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function (IIEF-EF) domain and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score; key secondary measures were the Sexual Encounter Profile Question 3 (SEP Q3) and BPH Impact Index (BII). Treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, orthostatic vital signs, clinical laboratory and uroflowmetry parameters, and postvoid residual volume were assessed. Results: Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N = 198) and 5 mg (N = 208) significantly improved IIEF-EF domain scores (both P < 0.001) vs. placebo (N = 200) at end point. For IPSS, improvements were significant with tadalafil 5 mg (P < 0.001), but not 2.5 mg, for observations from 2 weeks through end point (least-squares mean +/- standard error change from baseline at end point, placebo -3.8 +/- 0.5, tadalafil 2.5 mg -4.6 +/- 0.4, and 5 mg -6.1 +/- 0.4).

584,"Ehrlich, C. E. (2016",Learning together: Exploring the educational potential of a co-educational program on feminist art at the Brooklyn museum.,"This qualitative case study sheds light on the educational possibilities of an afterschool program in which a co-educational, diverse group of adolescents responded to feminist artworks at the Brooklyn Museum. The program was facilitated through critical pedagogies. Participants met in single gender groups for the first three sessions before coming together as one co-educational group in the remaining seven sessions. Data were collected from students' peer interviews, written reflections and digital recordings of group conversations. Two conversations that took place in the co-educational group captured participants' enthusiasm and engagement with artworks and each other. These two conversations were identified as critical incidents. One was in response to Judy Chicago's The Dinner Party, and the other in response to Mickalene Thomas' A Little Taste Outside of Love. Both conversations were analyzed to identify (a) the educational promise of the program, and (b) the opportunities for strengthening the program. In their dialogues about artworks, participants discussed topics suggested by the works that related to feminism and feminist art. In so doing, they also drew upon and considered their own life experiences. Findings suggest the program enabled participants to explore topics of empowerment, power relations, gender (in)equalities, double standards, and gender and race in the context of relationships (romantic, sexual, friendship, and family) from various perspectives. The program helped participants realize that, unlike what they had expected, not all members of the same gender think similarly. Discussions about and around feminist artworks helped participants to confront assumptions or misconceptions about gender and race, and to voice emergent values around these topics. Participants also recognized that their own opinions shifted and changed as they engaged with others. It is speculated that the successes of the program were based on the particular museum setting, the diversity of participants of different genders and backgrounds, exposure to feminist artworks selected to match adolescents' interests, guidelines that fostered mutual respect, and the variety of activities implemented to engage participants with artworks and each other, including digital technology. To strengthen future programs, such as the one studied, the dissertation suggests particular activities and teaching methods not adopted in this case. The researcher also argues for the incorporation of topics, including healthy masculinities, sexual orientation and racial literacy in programs on feminist art for adolescents.

(1988",Nonsexist research methods: A practical guide.,"This book has two major objectives: (1) to present an analysis of sexism in research that enlarges our understanding of this problem and sensitizes students and researchers to sexism in its various manifestations; and (2) to provide guidelines for solving the problem that offer clear and concise means of nonsexist alternatives. Chapter 7, organized by components of the research process, offers a set of guidelines for detecting and eliminating sexism in research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) In accessible and jargon-free language, Margrit Eichler provides a systematic approach to identifying, eliminating, and preventing sexist bias in social science research. She begins with a general discussion of the problems and implications of sexism in research, and then identifies four primary sources of bias: androcentricity, overgeneralization, gender insensitivity, and double standards. Three derivative sources of bias-sex appropriateness, familism, and sexual dichotomism-are also discussed. In the concluding chapter, Eichler outlines a step-by-step approach to avoiding the introduction of sexist bias at each phase of the research process. She also provides concrete suggestions for eliminating bias in titles, language, research design, concepts, research methods, data interpretation, and policy evaluations and recommendations. The book includes a Nonsexist Research Checklist that is designed as a handy reference to be used during the research process. ""Nonsexist Research Methods"" is appropriate to both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Written specifically with students in mind, this book will prove invaluable to researchers and research methods courses in sociology, political science, economics, psychology, anthropology, and women's studies.

589,"Ellwood, D. T. and C. Jencks (2004",,"American families changed dramatically during the last third of the twentieth century. From 1900 until the late 1960s, roughly three-quarters of all American sixteen-yearolds had lived with both of their biological parents. By 2000 only about half of all sixteenyear- olds were living with both biological parents. During the first half of the twentieth century, moreover, most parents who were not living with their children had no choice about the matter: They were dead. By the end of the twentieth century, most of the parents who were not living with their children were alive but living elsewhere (see figure 1.1). The focus of this chapter, however, is not simply the fact that family structures changed, but the fact that they changed very differently depending on parents' education and race. All groups are postponing marriage, but not all are postponing parenthood. As a result, the rise in single-parent families is concentrated among blacks and among the less educated. It hardly occurred at all among women with college degrees. Children's families have changed in broadly similar ways throughout the developed world, but no other nation has changed as much as the United States. The best evidence on this comes from the Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), which provide data on the stability of both marriages and cohabiting unions in Europe during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gunnar Andersson (2002) used these data to estimate the fraction of fifteen-year-olds who would live with both of their biological parents if parents continued to split up at the same rate as that found at the time of the FFS.1 Figure 1.2 shows his projections for the United States and six countries in western Europe. If nothing changed, roughly seven-eighths of southern European fifteen-year-olds and two-thirds of northern European fifteen-year-olds would live with both of their biological parents at age fifteen, compared to only half of all American fifteen-year-olds. The transformation of the American family since 1960 has been both an intellectual challenge and a recurrent source of frustration for social scientists. Some of the nation's best-known social theorists, including Gary Becker and William Julius Wilson, have sought to explain the change. Yet no consensus has emerged about why American families changed or why the amount of change varied by race and education. The most widely cited empirical papers seem to be those that disprove a popular explanation, not those that support one. Indeed, it is only a slight exaggeration to say that the main contribution of empirical social science to our understanding of family change has been to show that nothing caused it. Yet despite the absence of an identifiable culprit or a smoking gun, families did change. This report is divided into five sections. The first section discusses which changes in family structure should worry us. We argue that: â¢ Those whose primary goal is to reduce child poverty should mainly worry about the increased proportion of children living with only one adult, especially adults with relatively low potential earnings. â¢ Those whose primary goal is to improve children's overall well-being should also worry about the fact that even children in two-adult households are less likely to be living with both of their biological parents and more likely to be living with a stepparent or their mother's live-in boyfriend. â¢ Those whose primary goal is to bring American behavior into line with traditional moral rules should worry about the rising age of marriage (which has led to a large increase in premarital sex), the decline of shotgun weddings (which has led to a large increase in nonmarital births), and the high rate of divorce. The next section describes the most important changes affecting children's living arrangements over the past generation. â¢ Single-parent families have become more common in all demographic groups, but the increases have been greatest among less-educated women and African Americans. â¢ Women in all demographic groups are marrying later than they di a generation ago. But while highly educated women have postponed both marriage and parenthood, less-educated women have postponed marriage more than parenthood. As a result, nonmarital births have risen dramatically among less-educated women but more modestly among the highly educated. â¢ Compared to white women, African American women have also postponed marriage more than childbearing, so nonmarital births have risen faster among African Americans than among whites. â¢ White women with a college degree seldom have children out of wedlock. Most of those who become single mothers marry before their child is born but then divorce. Divorce rates among the highly educated have not risen since the early 1980s, so the fraction of highly educated mothers raising children on their own has not changed much since 1980. â¢ The increase in nonmarital births, which continued into the 1990s, was confined to the bottom two-thirds of the educational distribution. As a result, the association between a woman's educational attainment and her chances of being a single mother rose after 1980. â¢ Cohabiting couples now account for nearly half of all nonmarital births in the United States. Among whites, cohabiting couples account for almost all of the increase in nonmarital births since 1980. But unlike cohabiting couples in Europe, cohabiting couples in the United States usually split up within a few years of their baby's birth. The fact that ""high-risk"" couples have been switching from marriage to cohabitation since 1980 probably played a role in stabilizing the divorce rate. It is not clear whether the switch from marriage to cohabitation increased the risk that any given couple would split up. â¢ Attitudes toward premarital sex, gender roles, the value of marriage, and the acceptability of nonmarital childbearing changed rapidly during the late 1960s and 1970s. Such attitudes have changed far less since 1980. Changes in attitudes have not always moved in tandem with changes in behavior. Premarital sex increased sharply in the 1960s and 1970s, when attitudes were becoming more permissive. But premarital sex continued to increase during the 1980s and early 1990s, when attitudes towards premarital sex were not changing much. â¢ The age at which individuals first have sexual intercourse (whether marital or premarital) fell only a little between 1960 and 1990, while the age at which individuals married rose substantially. Taken together, these two facts suggest that premarital sex mainly replaced marital sex, not abstinence. This pattern does not vary much by education. â¢ In the early 1960s, most marriages were closely followed by a first birth. That linkage has now been broken. More women are having their first child well before they marry, and more women are marrying well before they have their first child. The third section discusses the social science literature on the role of wages, welfare benefits, and the sex ratio in explaining family change. The following section discusses the role of non-economic influences, such as changes in women's sense of control and efficacy, changes in attitudes toward nonmarital sex, cohabitation, nonmarital births, and divorce, and improvements in contraception, the legalization of abortion, and no-fault divorce. In the next section, we present some new evidence regarding some of these theories. We then present our conclusions in the final section. We come to several conclusions regarding the existing literature on changes in family composition: â¢ Traditional economic models emphasize the economic advantages that flow from the fact that one partner can specialize in child-rearing while the other specializes in market labor. These models predict that improvements in men's earning power will make marriage more common, while improvements in women's earning power will make marriage less common. These models also predict that lower welfare benefits will make marriage more common, while a lower ratio of men to women will make marriage less common. â¢ The wages available to men, the wages available to women, welfare benefits, and the sex ratio can explain a large fraction of the change in single-parenthood for different racial and educational groups. But the estimated impact of these variables is extremely sensitive to how we specify the statistical model. Copyright Â© 2004 by Russell Sage Foundation.",0,589
590,"Eltis, S. (2004",,"Having dominated French theatre for over two decades, at the end of the nineteenth century the fallen woman became an ever-present figure on the English stage. In 1873 Henry James declared in disgust, âJust as the light drama in France is a tissue of fantastic indecencies, the serious drama is an agglomeration of horrors.â Confronted by a string of plays by Alexandre Dumas fils, Sardou and Augier, which variously enjoined husbands to chastize, forgive, banish or shoot their unfaithful wives, James concluded of the French drama that âadultery is their only theme.â A decade later, adulterous heroines still dominated the Parisian stage and threatened to extend their influence across the channel. The intellectual sterility of the British stage was such, warned George Bernard Shaw in 1885, that âwe look on French dramatists as bold grapplers with social problems because their heroines sometimes commit adultery. Some of our own critics and playwrights, when lauding the French drama, occasionally express themselves in a manner that indicates their conviction that a little adultery would purify and ennoble the British stage.â But, he hastened to add, âOur drama is sinking for want, not of an Augier, but of an Ibsen.â His warnings were in vain. Dramas centring on adultery, seduction, and the issue of the sexual double standard became a staple of the London stage, so that by 1905 J. M. Barrie could write a comedy, Alice Sit-by-the-Fire, in which the inevitable affect of theatregoing on a young girlâs imagination is to make her believe that her mother must have a lover.

593,"Epstein, M. (2009","Adolescents in conflict: Associations between gender socialization, gender conflict, and well-being.","Although gender beliefs play an important role in shaping adolescents' mental health and risk behavior, little is known about the development of such beliefs or the role that parents play in gender socialization. Qualitative accounts suggest that parental messages are varied and often inconsistent, but no instruments exist that allow for a systematic examination of message content or the nature of such inconsistencies. Further, little is known about the impact of receiving conflicting socialization on gender conflict -internalizing conflicting gender expectations. Accordingly, the aim of the current work was to develop ways to quantitatively assess gender socialization and gender conflict and to test for connections to mental health and risk behavior among adolescents. The first study used a sample of 272 undergraduates to validate a Gender Socialization Scale that measured eight socialization discourses such as being nice, being tough, and traditional gender roles. A sample of 291 undergraduates was used to develop a Gender Conflict Scale that measured participants' perceptions of conflicting gender role expectations. The second study used the same sample to expand the Gender Socialization Scale to include discourses pertaining to gendered expectations in sexual situations, such as abstinence and the sexual double standard. Results from this study showed that receiving some types of conflicting messages was linked with increased gender conflict, which, in turn, was associated with depression, anxiety, body dissatisfaction and a greater number of sexual partners. Finally, using a sample of 259 high school students, results from the third study linked receiving conflicting socialization with increased gender conflict for younger adolescents. Associations between socialization discourses, gender conflict, gender attitudes, and outcomes were then simultaneously modeled using SEM. Socialization messages about gender predicted adolescents' own gender beliefs, but neither construct was related to outcomes. Abstinence communication, however, was associated with less sexual risk and substance use, whereas communication endorsing the sexual double standard was related to more risk. Receiving messages regarding the sexual double standard was also associated with increased gender conflict, which was related to anxiety, depression, and body dissatisfaction. However, receiving messages promoting egalitarian gender roles was associated with a decrease in gender conflict. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,593

Attitudes about others influence behavior, and negative attitudes can lead to the outright victimization of others. Past research concerning heterosexual attitudes has also shown that beliefs about male-female sexual activity, as well as attitudes about sexual minorities, are heavily influenced by gender. The present study investigates the relationship between 255 heterosexual male and female college students' attitudes toward heterosexual sexuality and their attitudes towards sexual minorities. Heterosexual attitudes were measured utilizing the Brief Sexual Attitudes Scale (BSAS) and attitudes towards sexual minorities were measured using the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (ATLG). Women's level of permissiveness toward heterosexual behavior correlated positively with their attitude toward lesbians and gay men. Men did not demonstrate such a relationship, but exhibited significantly more negative attitudes toward both male and female homosexuality. Attitudes toward gay men were more negative than attitudes towards lesbians.

Study 1 compared self-perceptions of academic ability and academic performance of female and male undergraduate science and engineering students from underrepresented ethnic and socioeconomic groups, upon admission in (Time 1) and graduation from (Time 2) the McNair Mentorship Program. Female and male students were similar in regard to academic performance. However, at Time 1, women were significantly more likely than their male peers to describe themselves as academically weaker. Upon graduation from the McNair Program, women's perceptions of their academic skills were on par with those of men. Students with double minority status (i.e. by sex, ethnicity, generation in college, or income) had more negative self perceptions of academic skills, as well as lower performance on standardized tests. Overall, these findings suggest that one barrier for women in STEM education is lower confidence. However, over time female McNair students in STEM increased their self-perception of academic competence. This study's findings also indicate that multiple minority status may have a cumulative negative impact on academic self-perceptions and academic performance. Study 2 focused on the experiences of high-achieving, female undergraduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who are majoring in engineering, physical, or life science. Interviews about educational choices and career aspirations were collected in written form upon admission to (Time 1) and graduation from (Time 2) the McNair Mentorship Program. Students' timing of educational and career decisions, motivations, parental expectations and involvement in educational and career planning, career exploration, and career aspirations were qualitatively analyzed longitudinally and across disciplines.

604,"Faulkner-Simmons, D. (2012",The Effects of Single-Sex Mathematics Classrooms on African American Males in the Ninth Grade.,"Research indicated that educators must consider socio-ecological accommodations because not all students learn in cooperative groups. Students must be taught how to discover the process of learning and to apply knowledge to real life situations. Gurian and Ballew (2003) identified differences in the male and female brain and the differences in how they learn. The single-sex grouping practice employed in this study allowed teachers an opportunity to teach students of the same sex. This study was designed to determine the effect single-sex classroom instruction has on African American males' achievement in ninth-grade mathematics compared to that of the other student groups. The researcher investigated a public school in a North Texas school district. The school's administration chose to offer alternative educational options for the students. Single-sex classrooms were created in the areas of mathematics and English Language Arts. Teachers taught single-sex classes of students from varied ethnic backgrounds during at least one double-blocked period each day. ""Ex post facto"" data were analyzed. An independent samples t-test and a two-way factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were utilized to test each hypothesis to determine whether significant differences existed in the scale scores of comparison groups on state-mandated assessments over a period of 3 years. The instrument used to measure academic achievement is the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills. This study found that the mathematics scores of African American males in single-sex classes did not significantly differ from the scores of African American males in coeducational classes. The scores for the males in single-sex classes were slightly higher than that of males in coeducational classes at each grade level throughout the 3-year period. The mathematics scores of African American females in single-sex learning environments were not significantly different than those of African American males in single-sex classes. The scores for the female students were consistently higher throughout the 3-year period. This study identified the need for additional school choice options for students as a means of eliminating the achievement gap.

This pooled analysis involving 737 patients across the 2 studies evaluated the metabolic effects of adjunctive aripiprazole in patients with major depressive disorder. Outcomes included mean change from end of prospective treatment phase to endpoint in body weight, waist circumference, fasting levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), fasting plasma glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C). Logistic regression determined whether baseline variables were associated with weight gain or whether weight change was associated with clinical outcome. Statistically significant increases occurred in mean body weight (adjunctive aripiprazole, +1.73 kg, vs adjunctive placebo, +0.38 kg; P < 0.001). Significantly more subjects receiving adjunctive aripiprazole had clinically relevant (>=7%) weight gain versus placebo (5.2% vs 0.6%; P < 0.001).

606,"Feagin, L. C. (1976",,"In a sociolinguistic study of the verb phrase in Southern White English, a pattern of change in progress was observed. The 14 variables studied showed that certain variants were increasing, others decreasing, and yet others stable across time within the community, and that each variable's change was progressing in a wave sensitive to age, social class, sex, and rural/urban origins. It is possible that these apparent changes were a reflection of age grading, since there are no earlier records of speech in that community. However, the variants that are decreasing are all older forms of English than those which are increasing and are dying or nonexistent outside Southern White and Black English. This suggests that age grading is not the primary factor here, but rather language change moving through the community. The variables examined were the standard and nonstandard variants of NP plural agreement; plural ""was,""""is""; singular ""don't""; irregular preterits and past participles; ""ain't""; negative concord; passive ""be"" and ""got""; perfective ""done""; ""a+verb+ing""; double modals; ""liketa""; and negative inversion.

607,"Fedorenko, O. (2015",Politics of sex appeal in advertising: Female creatives and post-feminist sensibility in South Korea.,"This article is an ethnographic exploration of how gender ideologies were negotiated in the South Korea of the 2000s, in advertising texts and in advertising workplaces. Advertising has been criticized for reproducing gender stereotypes, and it is easy to assume that it is men within advertising agencies who are responsible for the objectifying and sexualizing portrayals of women. Yet behind some of the raciest South Korean advertising campaigns were ambitious women, who not only eagerly repeated the marketing adage that ""sex sells"" but also, provocatively, attempted to obliterate the lingering patriarchal norms and double sexual standards - with sexualized advertising. This article examines the politics of sex appeal in contemporary South Korean advertising by drawing on participant observation at an advertising agency, interviews, and public discourse analysis. Having situated the women's interventions within the cultural-historical context of South Korea, I, first, show how women's embrace of the sex-appeal aesthetic was a strategy to succeed in a male-dominated work environment and, second, detail how fighting gender discrimination with sex-appeal advertising was a profoundly contradictory project. I suggest that the politics of sex appeal in advertising was symptomatic of how women's struggles for equality were collapsing into neoliberal post-feminist sensibility.

(2002","Democracy and its limits: Gender and rights in the Czech lands, 1918-1938.","In 1918, Czech feminists, buoyed by their intense faith in the democratic nature of the Czech nation, had assumed that creating a democracy in the Czech lands would be enough to bring women the rights they felt all individuals deserved. However, as their failed attempt to legalize women's civil equality made clear, few Czechs shared their egalitarian definition of democracy or their conception of citizenship. As they struggled to align their beliefs about democracy and gender difference, most Czechs eventually came to the conclusion that even a democratic nation could not afford to get rid of such differences; in fact, the good of the nation depended on maintaining the social distinctions between the sexes. The words of the Constitution notwithstanding, citizenship would not become a genderless category, and the legal rights granted to women and men would continue to be different, based on their different social roles. Although each sex had a right to freedom, that too was a gendered right rather than a universal one: it could never be allowed to contradict the dictates of the ""natural"" gender system. Women's rights would be based on the idea of womanhood rather than personhood, on what was best for their place as wife and mother. For many Czech women, a version of citizenship that allowed them to be politically active while protecting their roles as wives and mothers seemed like the best of all worlds. However, as the double earners discovered after being summarily fired in 1938, gender difference was a shaky ground on which to build a case for citizenship rights. As the definition of what was socially appropriate for women changed, so did their rights. Without recourse to a universal standard of citizenship, Czech women would find that they had no rights that could not be successfully challenged under the guise of protecting either family or femininity.",0,608

However, the establishment of cut-points is still in its infancy and little is known as to whether cut-points are affected by age or gender. The objectives of this paper were to establish optimal cut-points in pain severity in individuals with neck pain (NP) and to investigate if the cut-points were influenced by gender, age, and NP duration. Data from the population-based 'Funen Neck and Chest Pain Study' was used. Univariate and multivariate analyses of variance were performed to calculate optimal single and double cut-points for three different pain intensity scores within the past 2 weeks relative to two neck disability scales ('global assessment of NP' and the 'Copenhagen Neck Functional Disability Scale'). The two disability scales showed small differences in optimal cut-points. Furthermore, cut-points changed for each of the three pain intensity scales. Only small gender differences in cut-points were seen and no specific trend was noted in either single or double cut-points in different age groups. The cut-points were almost identical for acute, subacute, and chronic NP. This paper has implications for understanding the impact of using different pain intensity scales and provides reference cut-points in NP for use in future clinical and epidemiological research.

Participants included 417 students at community, public, and private colleges in Northern California who had been in a romantic relationship. Results indicate that although acceptance of betrayal is extremely low, the incidence of betrayal is nevertheless quite high, occurring in more than one third of the sample. The acceptance of betrayal varied with the circumstances under which betrayal occurred. Betrayal was more acceptable in a bad relationship or when there was a magnetic attraction to a new partner than when the perpetrators were being vindictive or were certain they would not get caught. Betrayal behavior was significantly correlated with sexual and intimacy variables including attitudes to betrayal, sexual permissiveness, early onset of sexual activity, and an avoidant relationship style. Male participants were more likely than female participants to be accepting of betrayal, but gender differences in the actual incidence of betrayal were not observed. This study illustrates that acts of betrayal are not as haphazard as they appear, because attitudes and personality characteristics are significant correlates of betrayal behavior.

Results indicated that both boys and girls in dual-career families were more masculine in their identification than were their counterparts in single-career families. Additional results demonstrated that mothers in the dual-career family tended to be less feminine in their sex-role orientation than in the single-career family; husbands from the two family types did not differ in their orientation. A double standard appeared in the socialization of children from dual-career families. Mothers particularly seemed tolerant of masculine preferences in daughters but intolerant of feminine preferences in sons.

This study examined the extent to which the means by which the complainants' intoxication was secured would influence this process.1 Mock jurors, having been exposed to a trial reconstruction in which intoxicated sexual consent was at issue, deliberated towards a unanimous, or failing that, majority verdict on whether rape had occurred. Across the trial scenarios, the only variables related to the type of intoxicant ingested and the means of its administration. In a context in which the Sexual Offences Act 2003 purports to restrict reliance in the jury room on questionable stereotypes about socio-sexual behaviour, this article considers the extent to which participants' views about responsibility for intoxication shaped their conclusions on the occurrence of, and liability for, rape. It also examines the ways in which the social acceptability of some intoxicants (alcohol) and the social unacceptability of others (Rohypnol) supported the construction of 'drug-assisted rape' as distinguishable from more mundane instances of intoxicated sex.

At least some of these findings may partially reflect different responses to certain contextual variables in research. College students (266 men and 463 women) were asked to anonymously report their sexual attitudes and behavior after reading one of three fictitious statements about research findings regarding gender differences in sexuality. Some past findings were replicated, with men reporting somewhat more sexual experience and more permissive sexual attitudes than women. However, women reported a significantly younger age at first intercourse than did men. While there was no significant sex difference for total number of sexual partners, there was a significant interaction. With female research assistants (but not with male assistants), men reported more sexual partners when they were told that women are now more sexually permissive than men. This finding appeared to be largely a function of the men who scored higher on measures of hypermasculinity and ambivalent sexism. Women's reports were not significantly affected by the wording of the cover sheet, regardless of the sex of the research assistant. Even in this anonymous survey, the sex of the experimenter and the nature of the statement about research findings had an impact on the sex differences that were found.

Aim: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of vardenafil vs. placebo in terms of success of maintenance of erection in men with ED and improvement of their female partner's sexual quality of life. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, parallel-group comparison of vardenafil vs. placebo for 12 weeks in men (>=18 years) with ED of >= 6 months duration, and their female partners. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in patient's overall response rate to Sexual Encounter Profile question 3 (SEP3) ""Did your erection last long enough for you to have sexual intercourse?"" and female partner's response to the quality of life domain of the modified Sexual Life Quality Questionnaire (mSLQQ-QOL) at last observation carried forward (LOCF) were considered the primary efficacy measures. In addition, patient's response to SEP2 ""Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?,"" the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and patient's mSLQQ-QOL score were also assessed. Results: Compared with placebo, vardenafil significantly improved overall least square (LS) mean per-patient SEP3 success rate (28% vs. 68%; P < 0.0001) and partner's LS mean (standard error [SE]) mSLQQ-QOL score at LOCF (32.14 [3.24] vs. 65.80 [3.10]; P < 0.0001).

(2015",“I’m Not One of Those Girls”: Boundary-Work and the Sexual Double Standard in a Liberal Hookup Context.,"Sexual morality is not keeping up with the new sexual practices of young people, even in cultures oriented toward gender equality. The Norwegian high school graduation celebration constitutes an exceptionally liberal context for sexual practices. Many of the 18-year-old participants in this three-week-long celebration engage in âhookupâ activities, involving kissing, fondling, and sexual intercourse. Through an analysis of qualitative interviews with 25 women and 16 men, we argue that while they avoided overt slut-shaming, the morally abject position of the âslutâ was still sustained by implication. The young women drew symbolic boundaries against anonymous other women who failed to value safety, hygiene, and self-control. This boundary-work was combined with declarations of tolerance of hookup practices, reflecting a sexually liberal culture geared toward gender equality. That young women who hooked up also drew boundaries against âotherâ women indicates a lack of alternative gender beliefs that allow young women to positively associate with hooking up. The young men also drew symbolic boundaries in their talk about sex, but enjoyed more freedom in their moral positioning. Although the liberal context was evident, the gendered difference in sexual boundary-work may contribute to the persistence of a sexual double standard among young people.

Drug-free obsessive-compulsive subjects did not differ from controls on measures of platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, nor on plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine concentrations at rest and after a standard orthostatic challenge procedure. Compared with placebo, treatment with clomipramine was clinically effective and produced a marked decrease in platelet serotonin concentration, a trend toward a reduction in platelet MAO activity, and a rise in standing plasma norepinephrine. Clinical improvement during drug therapy was closely correlated with pretreatment platelet serotonin concentration and MAO activity, as well as with the decrease in both measures during clomipramine administration. This suggests that the effects of clomipramine on serotonin uptake may be essential to the antiobsessional action observed. Â© 1987, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",0,621

In the pursuit of radical difference from the present, past divisions were elided, and Rome's sexual patterns were subsumed within a classical paradigm of distinctly Greek construction. They are now breaking free, however, and more recent scholarship has been concerned, quite precisely, with demarcating and exploring definitively Roman sexual territories. This article explores the most recurrent themes to emerge from the recent scholarship on Roman sexuality.

In my sample, 2.4% of women experienced sexual assault during their most recent hookup. Results show women do not experience an increased risk of physically forced intercourse until they have consumed nine or more drinks. In addition, women were more likely to report sexual assault during a hookup with a man they did not know well. Together, these findings suggest that men are more likely to assault women who are drunk, possibly because the double standard has made them respect such women less, or because they target women who are likely unable to resist or recall what happened. It also appears that the âin-network strangerâ may be the individual most dangerous to women in college hookups. Â© 2017 Eastern Sociological Society",0,623

Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, has antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This pilot study examined the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with pramipexole and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram in MDD. Methods: In this double-blind, controlled, pilot study, 39 patients with DSM-IV MDD who had failed to respond to a standard antidepressant treatment trial were randomized to receive pramipexole (n = 13), escitalopram (n = 13), or their combination (n = 13) for six weeks. Pramipexole was started at 0.375 mg/day and titrated weekly up to 2.25 mg/day; escitalopram dosage remained at 10 mg/day. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results: Subjects receiving pramipexole monotherapy had significantly lower MADRS scores than the combination group (p = 0.01); no other primary drug comparisons were significant. The combination group had a substantially higher dropout rate than the escitalopram and pramipexole groups (69%, 15%, 15%, respectively).

Conclusions: The combination of an SSRI and a dopamine agonist was not more effective than either agent alone, nor did it produce a more rapid onset of antidepressant action.

Six accounts emerged: sex as responsible, intimate and shared experience; sex as joint fun; ideal versus reality; sex has to be responsible, consensual and shared; caring relationships offer the perfect context for fulfilling sex; and equality between partners. The importance of cultural context in the availability of specific dominant and alternative discourses is discussed with a focus on how this influences young people's sense-making with regard to sexuality and sexual relationships. Future directions for research are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,632
633,"French, L. (1978",,"Our society has long adhered to a double standard of justice, one for male offenders and another for females. This system survived with little controversy mainly due to the small female prison population. But recent events have drawn attention to not only the issue of female criminality, but to the treatment of women while incarcerated. Female criminality has traditionally been associated with sexual offenses, shoplifting, false pretense, fraud, and victim precipitated violence. While many believed that the feminist movement would increase and expand criminality, it seems that increases in female arrest can better be attributed to a criminal justice backlash, reflecting a harder stance toward women by the male dominated criminal justice system. Within penal institutions, examples abound of female inmate abuse at the hands of male enforcers of the system. The major factor making females more susceptible to abuse is sexual discrimination. In addition, among female offenders who are punished, racial bias is in evidence. The black female is doubly discriminated against as a result of her gender and her color. For discrimination against all female offenders to cease, better female facilities and a new awareness among criminal justice practitioners are necessary. (Author/GC)",0,633

A double-blind block-randomized experimental design was used with 104 young drivers (aged 19-24 yrs), with 2 experimentally manipulated independent factors: 3 levels of alcohol consumption (0% BAC, 0.015% BAC, 0.03% BAC) and 2 feedback conditions (positive or negative). Three dependent variables were assessed: perception of traffic accident risk, subjective judgement about driving-relevant cognitive performance, decision to drive a car. Ss with 0.015 BAC performed better than persons in both other alcohol conditions on the standardized risk perception task. Perceived handicap of driving was significantly more pronounced for negative feedback compared to positive feedback with no influence of the level of alcohol consumption. No significant influence on decision to drive was found of either level of alcohol consumption, feedback or sex. Implications for public health programs are discussed.

635,"Frick, U., et al. (2003",Involuntary psychiatric inpatient treatment in the canton of Zurich 1995-2001: How many? Who? How? Which outcome?,"Background: There is a long-term discussion on legitimation and ethical foundation of coercive treatment in psychiatry. Mental health professionals as well as society tolerate coercive measures in a position of double ""paternalism"". Medical paternalism favours the hope of fulfilling the assumed real will of a patient by treating the malady that darkens the patient's will. Social paternalism seeks to protect members of society from perceived though not epidemiologically proven risks stemming from mentally ill persons. Epidemiological data on involuntary hospitalisation has not been available for Switzerland at methodologically sufficient standards. Aims: This paper aims at describing the frequency of involuntary hospitalisation, referral patterns for inpatient treatment, therapeutic measures undertaken and outcome of involuntary patients as compared to voluntary patients. Methods: Involuntary hospitalisation was operationalised as physicians1 ratings of the presumed will of the patient, documented in the database PSYREC of the Swiss canton of Zurich. This database covered all admissions between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2001 (n = 50055). It was used to estimate the proportion of involuntary hospitalisations among all psychiatric admissions. A population-based age and sex standardised rate of involuntary hospitalisations per 1000 inhabitants was calculated for the years between 1996 and 2001. Indepth analysis of referral patterns, therapeutic measures and outcome was performed in a subsample of n = 24607 treatment episodes from January 1,1998 until December 31,2000. Results: About 33% of all hospitalisations between 1995 and 1997 were rated as involuntary. For the period between 1998 and 2001 the rate of involuntary hospitalisations had decreased to a lower level of about 28%. The rate of involuntary hospitalisations per 1000 inhabitants rose from 1.57 in 1995 to 1.99 in 2001. The 6-year increase of 27% in the rate of involuntary hospitalisations was considerably smaller than the simultaneous increase of more than 50% for the total hospitalisation rate in the same period. Male and female patients had very similar risks of involuntary hospitalisation. The age profile of voluntary and involuntary patients was similar. Involuntary admissions were more prevalent among patients with diagnoses at admission of mania (F30), delusional disorders (F22) and schizotypal disorders (F21). The great majority of involuntary intakes were initiated by the health care system (general practitioners and psychiatric specialists both >25%, somatic hospitals 17%). Legal authorities were responsible for only 5% of involuntary admissions. The risk of being coercively medicated during the hospital stay was 6-fold for involuntarily admitted patients. Their risk of fixation or isolation was 5.6 times higher. Psychopharmacological medication (either forced or voluntary) is the most prominent therapeutic measure during the hospital stay (for both voluntary and involuntary patients in about 75%). Involuntary patients receive more crisis intervention, but less other therapeutic measures during their stay as compared to voluntary patients. Physicians' ratings of the outcome of involuntary stays displayed no difference to the outcome of voluntary stays. Discussion: The rate of involuntary treatment is high for the canton of Zurich compared to other European countries. However, hospitalisation rates have increased faster for voluntary patients than involuntary patients, probably due to changing treatment habits in the mental health care system. Outcome of involuntary hospitalisation seems comparable to voluntary hospitalisation despite a lower intensity of measures undertaken, but this result should be validated using more rigorous methodological standards.

636,"Friedman, M., et al. (2014",From bias to bisexual health disparities: Attitudes toward bisexual men and women in the United States.,"Purpose: A newly emergent literature suggests that bisexual men and women face profound health disparities in comparison to both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Additionally, bisexual individuals often experience prejudice, stigma, and discrimination from both gay/lesbian and straight communities, termed ""biphobia."" However, only limited research exists that empirically tests the extent and predictors of this double discrimination. The Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Scale (BIAS) was developed to test associations between biphobia and sexual identity. Methods: Using standard techniques, we developed and administered a scale to a purposive online sample of adults from a wide range of social networking websites. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to refine scales assessing attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexual women, respectively. Using generalized linear modeling, we assessed relationships between BIAS scores and sexual identity, adjusting for covariates. Results: Two separately gendered scales were developed, administered, and refined: BIAS-m (n = 645), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual men, and BIAS-f (n = 631), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual women. Across scales, sexual identity significantly predicted response variance. Lesbian/gay respondents had lower levels of binegative attitudes than their heterosexual counterparts (all p-values < .05); bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their straight counterparts (all p-values < .001); and bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their lesbian/gay counterparts (all p-values < .05).Within racial/ethnic minority respondents, biracial/multiracial status was associated with lower bi-negativity scores (all p-values < .05). Conclusions: This study provides important quantitative support for theories related to biphobia and double discrimination. Our findings provide strong evidence for understanding how stereotypes and stigma may lead to dramatic disparities in depression, anxiety, stress, and other health outcomes among bisexual individuals in comparison to their heterosexual and homosexual counterparts. Our results yield valuable data for informing social awareness and intervention efforts that aim to decrease bi-negative attitudes within both straight and gay/lesbian communities, with the ultimate goal of alleviating health disparities among bisexual men and women.

(2018","Sleeping oxygen saturation, rapid eye movement sleep, and the adaptation of postprandial metabolic function in insulin sensitive and resistant individuals without diabetes.","Aims: Sleeping oxygen saturation (SaO2) and sleep stage duration have been linked with prediabetic alterations but the pathogenic pathways are not well understood. This study of insulin sensitive and resistant adults examined the effect on postprandial metabolic regulation of repeated mixed-meal challenges of different carbohydrate loading. The aim was to examine whether the relationship between lower sleeping oxygen saturation (SaO2) and poorer fasting and postprandial metabolic function may be linked with reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) duration, independent of age, sex and total adiposity. Methods: The 24 men and women, aged 25-54 years, had no diabetes or other diagnosed conditions, were evaluated with polysomnography to derive indices of SaO2 and sleep architecture. In addition, an OGTT and two 14-h serial mixed-meal tests were administered over 3 successive in-patient days. The carbohydrate content of the mixed-meals was manipulated to compare a standard-load day with a double-load day (300 vs. 600 kcal/meal). Quantitative modeling was applied to derive beta-cell glucose sensitivity (beta-GS), early insulin secretion rate sensitivity (ESRS), and total postprandial insulinemia (AUCINS). Results: Analyses showed that, for the 14-h tests, the SaO2 relationship with metabolic outcomes was associated significantly with percent time spent in REM but not SWS, independent of age, sex and total adiposity. Specifically, indirect pathways indicated that lower SaO2 was related to shorter REM duration, and shorter REM was respectively associated with higher beta-GS, ESRS, and AUCINS for the 300- and 600-load days (300 kcal/meal: beta = -8.68, p < .03, beta = -8.54, p < .002, and beta = -10.06, p < .008; 600 kcal/meal: beta = -11.45, p < .003, beta = -11.44, p < .001, and beta = -11.00, p < .03). Conclusion: Sleeping oxygen desaturation and diminished REM duration are associated with a metabolic pattern that reflects a compensatory adaptation of postprandial insulin metabolism accompanying preclinical diabetic risk.

Three hundred and eleven participants evaluated a male or a female target who was either a primary breadwinner or a primary caregiver. Attributions of personal traits, moral emotions, and marital emotions were examined. Results showed that both traditional and egalitarian individuals applied a double standard when judging deviations from gendered family roles. However, and as predicted, traditional individuals evaluated the normative targets more favorably than the norm-violating targets, whereas egalitarians evaluated the norm-violating targets more favorably. These findings shed light on the important moderating role of gender ideologies and help account for the inconsistencies in previous findings regarding social judgments of gender norm violators.

The returned empty applicators were inspected visually in a standardized manner for residue on the outside of the applicator, as an indicator of vaginal insertion. Over 15 months, spanning 11,839 study visits by 838 women, a total of 59,800 returned empty applicators were inspected. By visual assessment, 77.5 % of these applicators appeared to have been inserted. To test the accuracy of the assessment we fitted a Cox model and found that the risk for HIV infection was doubled when less than half of the returned empty applicators had been assessed as not inserted in the vagina. Visual inspection enhanced both the accuracy of the adherence measurement and aided identification of mechanical problems with applicator use experienced by women in the trial.

(2009",ADHD summer camp: Development and evaluation of a multimodal intervention program.,"The present study investigates whether a multimodal, learning theory-based summer camp group training (ASCT, over 12 days) leads to improvement in ADHD symptoms. Of particular interest was determining the specific effect of integrating response-cost-token training (RCT). In an experimental pre-post1-post2 design, the ASCT was compared to a standardized parental education intervention (SPE). 27 children and adolescents, ranging in age from 7 to 17 years, were randomized by age, sex, and ADHD symptoms into the ASCT group (N = 18) or the SEP group (N = 19). During the summer camp social skills training, sports activities, and school tests were introduced. In all conditions of the summer camp the children were exposed to a standardized RCT. Moreover, the children were given medication according to a double-blind, crossover, and randomized design with three conditions: once-daily extended-release methylphenidate, twice-daily immediate-release methylphenidate, and placebo. Trained assistants observed the behavior of the children in specific situations using the SCAMP as the evaluation measure. Moreover, parents and teachers completed standardized questionnaires for the children prior to the summer camp and at 6 and 24 months after the training. The results showed a significant improvement of ADHD symptoms after the summer camp was completed, as well as 2 years later. This was evident in the ratings provided by the teachers but not by the parents. Of interest is the finding of increased symptoms of ADHD immediately following the SEP, as noted by the teachers. These effects seem attributable to the RCT. The results of the study show that a multimodal, intensive, learning theory-oriented ADHD summer camp leads to long-lasting clinical effects, if combined with RCT. For economic reasons the ADHD summer camp could be an expedient intervention in outpatient hospitals and clinical practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,643

This is an important and provocative article that deserves to be widely read. It highlights the ways in which young women's bodies have become the locus of contemporary dilemmas about both feminism and multiculturalism. The authors' article on headscarves and porno chic has made a number of important contributions to debates about young women-in particular, highlighting the double standards in the ways that girls' and boys' clothing choices are understood, and in exploring how the female body is the site of anxieties and contestation about multiculturalism and feminism. In this article, the commentator sought to engage with their article on a topic of significance to feminism: conceptualizations of choice and agency. More broadly, he has interrogated the move away from notions of cultural influence and in their place the promotion of the figure of the autonomous, freely choosing female subject. He has suggested that such a notion reinstates, via the back door, the rational, unified subject that has been the object of such sustained feminist critique; that it does not allow for an understanding of the complexities of the relationship between the social/cultural and psychic; and, moreover, that it remains complicit with, rather than critical of, the discourses of individualized, postfeminist neoliberalism.

Main Outcome Measures: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-IA), Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, and International Index of Erectile Function 5-item (IIEF-5) scale at baseline, 18 and 30 weeks were analysed using multilevel analysis. Methods: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00696748), 184 men suffering from both the MetS and hypogonadism were included. They were treated for 30 weeks with either parenteral testosterone undecanoate (TU; 1,000 mg IM TU, at baseline, and after 6 and 18 weeks; Nebido) or placebo injections, 105 (92.9%) men receiving TU and 65 (91.5%) receiving placebo completed the 30-week trial. Results: The 184 men were aged mean 52.1 years old (standard deviation [SD] 9.6; range 35-69), with a mean body mass index of 35.5 kg/m2 (SD 6.7; range 25.1-54.8), and a mean total testosterone level of 8.0 nmol/L (SD 4.0).

A qualitative study where adolescents, both smokers and non-smokers, were interviewed individually (N = 21) and participated in focus groups (N = 18 focus groups, 3-10 participants per group). Social contexts emerged as most relevant and salient themes related to smoking behavior. White females perceived the most permissive parental messages around smoking, while males, especially African-American males, reported receiving the strictest parental sanctions. Females' need to fit in with peers contrasted with males' being coerced to smoke. Possible reasons for African-Americans' non-use of cigarettes includes a desire not to disrespect parents and being turned off by parental addiction to nicotine. All adolescents cited the school's lax anti-smoking policy as a reason teens smoke at school.

This paper contributes to studies of single parenthood by examining acceptance of unmarried parenthood for men versus women. Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households (1992-1994), we show that there is somewhat greater acceptance of single mothers than single fathers, and women are more accepting than men of single mothers. There is some indication that there may be greater approval over time, given that younger individuals and those who experienced family disruption as children are more accepting of single parenthood.

The results indicated that taller and shorter women showed a higher percentage of support (p = 0.031) due to the greater double support time. Women of the medium height groups presented an earlier toe off (p = 0.018) because of the shorter support phase. Shorter men showed greater ankle plantar flexion than taller men (p = 0.033) as shorter foot length entailed the need for greater ankle extension in toe off. In conclusion, height should be taken into account when describing gait patterns because it would be useful in planning treatment strategies, adapting robotic exoskeletons for gait re-education and the design of orthoses and prostheses.",0,653
654,"Goodkind, D. (2011","Child underreporting, fertility, and sex ratio imbalance in China.","Child underreporting is often neglected in studies of fertility and sex ratio imbalance in China. To improve estimates of these measures, I use intercensal comparisons to identify a rise in underreporting, which followed the increased enforcement and penalization under the birth planning system in 1991. A new triangulation of evidence indicates that about 19% of children at ages 0-4 were unreported in the 2000 census, more than double that of the 1990 census. This evidence contradicts assumptions underlying the fertility estimates of most recent studies. Yet, the analysis also suggests that China's fertility in the late 1990s (and perhaps beyond) was below officially adjusted levels. I then conduct a similar intercensal analysis of sex ratios of births and children, which are the world's highest primarily because of prenatal sex selection. However, given excess underreporting of young daughters, especially pronounced just after 1990, estimated ratios are lower than reported ratios. Sex ratios in areas with a ""1.5-child"" policy are especially distorted because of excess daughter underreporting, as well as sex-linked stopping rules and other factors, although it is unclear whether such policies increase use of prenatal sex selection. China's sex ratio at birth, once it is standardized by birth order, fell between 2000 and 2005 and showed a continuing excess in urban China, not rural China.

(2016",Sex differences in weight loss among veterans with serious mental illness: Observational study of a national weight management program.,"Purpose: Obesity disproportionately burdens individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), especially women. This observational study investigated whether there were sex differences in weight loss and program participation among veterans with SMI enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) MOVE! weight management program. Procedures: Participants were identified from a national cohort of 148,254 veterans enrolled in MOVE! during fiscal years 2008 through 2012 who attended two or more sessions within 12 months of enrollment. The cohort included those with International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses for SMI, age less than 70 years, and weight data at baseline and one or more follow-up timepoints within approximately 1 year of enrollment (n = 8,943 men; n = 2,245 women). Linear mixed models assessed associations of sex with 6- and 12-month weight change from baseline, adjusting for demographic- and site-level variables. Findings: Both sexes averaged 6.4 (standard deviation, 4.6) sessions within 12 months; however, women with and without SMI participated at rates double their respective proportion rates among all VHA users. Participants averaged statistically significant weight loss at 6 months (men, -2.5 lb [95% CI, -2.8 to -2.1]; women, -2.4 lb [95% CI, -3.1 to -1.7]) and 12 months (men, -2.5 lb [95% CI, -2.8 to -2.2]; women, -2.9 lb [95% CI, -3.6 to -2.2]), but no sex-based difference in absolute weight loss at either timepoint. Slightly more women achieved 5% or greater (clinically significant) weight loss at the 12-month follow-up than did men (25.7% vs. 23.0%; p < .05). Conclusions: Women with SMI participated in MOVE! at rates equivalent to or greater than men with SMI, with comparable weight loss. More women were Black, single, had bipolar and posttraumatic stress disorder, and higher service-connected disability, suggesting areas for program customization.

Evidence from a survey of 28 male and 79 female middle-class individuals (aged 16-22 yrs) in New Zealand shows that Ss' stereotype of a lower-class female speaker includes potential sexual immorality. Because of society's double standard regarding men's and women's sexual behavior, the stereotype affects women more than men and could be an explanation for middle-class women's use of prestige forms as a way of avoiding association with the lower-class stereotype.

These notions have been shaped by gendered double standards, including measures of sexual morality, personal demeanor, housekeeping, and self-sacrifice, that are applied to women but not to men. Most fundamental, the fact that women are the primary child raisers has given many of them, in modern societies, two jobs--working for wages and working without wages to raise children. The modern welfare system arose from campaigns to help mothers who try to perform these two jobs without male help. Focusing first on deserted women, then on widows, and more recently on never-married mothers, U.S. welfare policy in the twentieth century was self-defeating because it tried to provide for poor children while avoiding giving aid or encouragement to lone mothers.

Among the much-replicated empirical findings that the authors mention in their article are that IQ tests measure a general learning ability, predict many kinds of life success to some degree, measure cognitive ability equally well among American Blacks and Whites, and predict academic achievement equally well in both groups. The authors also mention that social environments are not just external but have both genetic and environmental components and that race exists as a biological entity or continuum. Such conclusions are mainstream among specialists on human variation in intelligence. The authors own misstatements illustrate how small but consistent error can reinforce the prevailing public misperceptions that the intelligence-research community is still in a muddle about what intelligence is and that it lacks due diligence in looking for test bias and shrinking IQ gaps. Three of these examples are mistaken criticisms of core intelligence research, the fourth reflects uncritical acceptance of others' false claims against it, and the fifth is a conceptual error resulting in false praise for an unwarranted claim against IQ tests.

660,"Grabill, C. M. (1998",The relation between memories of childhood relationships and the parenting practices of mothers and fathers.,"This study investigates intergenerational influences on parenting. Although research has supported the idea that parenting practices have links to childhood relationships in the family-of-origin, most of this previous work has looked only at mothers or has not investigated the effects of memories of relationships with fathers. Because the primary caregiver is most often the mother, attachment theory predicts that memories of maternal relationships will influence behavior in other relationships, including parenting behaviors (Bowlby, 1979). In contrast, identification theory proposes that, because children identify with their same-gender parent, relationships with the same-gender parent will be related to parenting (Chodorow, 1979). Because of the links between authoritative parenting and positive child outcome, the current study tests these two theories to determine whether parents' authoritative attitudes and behaviors are more related to memories of their childhood relationships with their same-gender or opposite-gender parents. Eighty, two-parent, intact families participated in a study of parenting practices during middle childhood. Parents completed the Mother-Father-Peer Scale (Epstein, 1983) to report on their memories of acceptance and encouragement of independence from their mothers and fathers during their childhood. Parents reported on their authoritative parenting attitudes using the Child-Rearing Practices Report (Block, 1965). Authoritative parenting behaviors were measured with the Family Interaction Q-Sort (Gjerde, 1986) during a parent-child interaction task. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to test the contribution of memories of maternal and paternal relationships to mothers' and fathers' authoritative attitudes and behaviors. The gender of the child did not significantly affect links between parents' memories and parenting attitudes and behaviors. The results provide more support for attachment theory than for identification theory. For both mothers and fathers, memories of maternal encouragement of independence were related to authoritative attitudes, while memories of paternal relationships did not significantly contribute to the variance explained. Parents' authoritative attitudes were related to their authoritative behaviors. Memories of parental relationships were not significantly related to authoritative behaviors. Attitudes may mediate the relation between memories of childhood relationships and parenting behaviors, and may be one mechanism by which parenting behaviors are repeated across generations.

Patrick (Stella) Campbell appeared as the title character in Arthur Wing Pinero's The Second MRS Tanqueray at the St James's Theatre in London. The play told of a respectable widower, Aubrey Tanqueray, and his doomed second marriage to Paula, a younger woman with a past. Good wives did not have pasts, and Paula's is particularly scandalous for she has, since adolescence, kept house with a series of men. Aware that their marriage is unlikely to be accepted by their peers, Paula and Aubrey retreat to the country, where they are joined by Aubrey's adult daughter, Ellean. Ellean subsequently becomes engaged to a young soldier, Hugh Ardale. The crisis of the play occurs when Paula and Ardale come face to face and the audience learns that the pair had once lived together in London. With this revelation, Paula becomes convinced that she cannot outrun her past, and the play closes with her suicide. Despite the conventionality of its ending, the play was considered modern and daring and is remembered as one of the first attempts to represent the fallen woman sympathetically and to question the sexual double standard that operated in Victorian society. Campbell's clarity of expression and relatively unmannered delivery enhanced Pinero's uncommonly sympathetic portrait of a former courtesan. However, it was the actress's physical presence that particularly captured the audience's imagination. Campbell was tall, pale, and thin to the point of angularity - A representative example of the fashionable neurasthenic woman of the 1890s. Pinero's characterization joined with Campbell's playing style and (most important) her physicality to create the entity I dub Paula Tanqueray circa 1893. This entity haunted Campbell's entire career, acting as a ghostly double to her living body both onstage and off. Campbell continued to play the role of Paula Tanqueray into the 1920s, yet as the actress's body matured and changed, that of the ghost retained its svelte 1893 proportions and youthful charm, creating a corporeal dissonance that disrupted audience reception.

It argues that until a VADPR-sponsored civil damages case was defeated at the Court of Appeal in 1881, the feminist critique held the possibility of radically reshaping women's medico-legal treatment in England and Wales. Its ultimate failure, moreover, explains the surprising absence of infanticide as a specific campaign issue for the British women's movement from the 1880s until shortly before the First World War.

Male hysteria over the Bobbitt case also illustrates a tired double standard in which isolated cases of female aggression are read as evidence of the routine victimization of White men rather than as evidence of men's power to voice their complaints in the media (while silencing women's) or as evidence of White men's privileged entitlement to sexual invulnerability.

The sample was composed of 129 intact families with a first born child between the ages of 10 and 15. Measures included ratings of a mother's psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms), reports of marital cohesion level; quality of maternal parenting behavior (i.e., warmth/rejection, psychological and behavior control); and measures of preadolescent psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, identity development, self-reliance, emotional autonomy). Findings indicated that maternal reports of depressive symptomatology were associated with diminished parenting behavior, while poor marital cohesion level was directly related to preadolescent adjustment. Mothers reporting high depressive symptoms were rated as more rejecting, more psychologically controlling, and more permissive by their sons and daughters. Poor marital cohesion--and not maternal depressive symptomatology--was related to elevated depressive symptoms and unhealthy detachment for these preadolescent children. Differential relations were discerned as a function of preadolescent gender, however. Depressive mothers of sons were rated as permissive, and depressive mothers of daughters as more rejecting and psychologically controlling. Similarly, poor marital cohesion was associated with higher depressive symptoms in daughters only, yet predicted unhealthy detachment in both girls and boys. The present investigation underscores the importance of considering child gender in research on diminished parenting and intergenerational relations of maladaptation and pathology and is discussed within the context of maternal psychological health, co-occurring risk factors, and offspring vulnerability.

Not only is sexually explicit material abundantly available on every device, but people are increasingly engaging in creating pornographic materials using information communication technology. Against this background, technology has provided a medium that enables new forms of sexual engagement, but also unlawful behaviours, including revenge porn, that is, the non-consensual distribution of sexually explicit images of an intimate partner, which has become known as a weapon for disgruntled partners. Countless interactive pornographic websites have been created for the purpose of enabling the sharing of sexually explicit images for the sole purpose of revenge by publicly shaming and humiliating the depicted person. Once images are uploaded they can end up anywhere on the internet. Furthermore, emerging sexually abusive behaviours include âcatfishingâ and âsextortionâ are behaviours that extend the concept of image-based sexual abuse. There seems to be a double-standard and a lack of recognition of the wide-ranging impact on victimised womenâs health, wellbeing and livelihood. Victimblaming attitudes prevail, such as a focus on the origin of the image rather than on the non-consensual nature of the access and distribution of sexually explicit images and videos. The purpose of this chapter is to situate imagebased sexual abuse within the context of intimate partner violence and to challenge claims that non-contact sexual victimisation is trivial. A better understanding of these emerging sexual behaviours using internet technology will allow victimised women and girls to seek, help and to correct victim-blaming attitudes among professionals as well as in the general community.

Religiosity has been identified as a component of the spiritual dimension of health and wholeness that has been a consistent factor in either deterring intercourse initiation, or promoting more responsible intercourse behaviors. Existentialism, the other component of spirituality has not been not been reported as an antecedent to coital activity. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between the two components of spirituality (defined as Spiritual Well-Being), premarital sexual permissiveness and premarital intercourse practices.

Finding were as follows: (1) More than two-thirds of the students were non-virgins. (2) More than two-thirds of the students (virgins and non-virgins) found both components of spirituality (Spiritual Well-Being) very important and closely associated this dimension with conservative beliefs and attitudes about premarital sexual permissiveness (intercourse less likely in non-committed relationships). (3) The highly significant relationship between Spiritual Well-Being and sexual permissiveness was strongly influenced by church attendance, gender, race and length of time dating primary partner. (4) Spiritual Well-Being was perceived as an attribute of self-efficacy that served as a control when making intercourse decisions. (5) A higher degree of Spiritual Well-Being among non-virgins across all campuses promoted more responsible sexual behavior, defined as less frequent intercourse, fewer intercourse partners, more likely to use contraceptives and discuss contraceptive methods; among virgins and non-virgins less likely to participate in mouth-genital contact and anal intercourse. Findings from this investigation has provided an initial step in establishing an association between the existential component of spirituality as an antecedent for premarital sexual intercourse behaviors. These findings have also added to the empirical data for the association between the religious component and the same behaviors.

Maternal baseline characteristics in the first trimester were similar between groups. Children in the metformin group had a higher BMI Z score than those in the placebo group (difference in means=0Â·41, 95% CI 0Â·03â0Â·78, p=0Â·03). Interpretation: The increased BMI in metformin-exposed children might indicate a potential risk of inferior cardiometabolic health. Implications for adult health cannot be excluded.

Results indicate that EDR during courtship are prevalent, with 70.9% of the men and 57.4% of the women participating in EDR or knowing their partner had participated in EDR. For men, extradyadic permissiveness and years dating were positively related to EDR. No significant relationship was found between religiosity or sexual attitude and EDR.

Lindemann (2018","Acceptance of female public toplessness: Structural, contextual, and individual predictors of support.","Despite frequent attention in contemporary culture, little empirical research has been done on acceptance of female public toplessness during the past 20 years. As a replication and extension of prior work (Fischtein et al., 2005), an international survey of 314 women and 86 men reported their opinions toward the legality of female toplessness in three public settings. Overall, support ranged from 58% to 76% and was higher than observed in prior surveys from the 1990s. Context, or the specific location where toplessness occurs, remained an important consideration for support. In addition, demographic and attitudinal factors served to predict support and opposition to public toplessness. Specifically, higher religiosity and lower attitudes toward sexual permissiveness were associated with opposition to public toplessness, whereas, lower child protectiveness beliefs and lower trait disgust sensitivity were associated with support of public toplessness. Although men were generally more supportive of public toplessness, gender did not emerge as a significant predictor. Sampling differences and concerted efforts through social media and political campaigns that occurred between prior surveys and the current study may explain, at least in part, the increased overall support and lack of gender differences. As such, these findings may have important societal and legal implications for the acceptance of female public toplessness. Â© 2018 University of Toronto Press Inc. All rights reserved.",0,680
681,"Hare-Mustin, R. T. (1995",,"Constructivist approaches to therapy that view the therapist and patient as equal participants in co-creating a new dialogue render aspects of experience invisible. What is missing is an awareness of the dominant structures in society and the dominant ways of thinking and speaking. Three key factors need to be understood: first, the way meanings are embedded in language; second, the hierarchical nature of relationships, including the therapeutic relationship; and third, the larger social context in which therapy as an institution exists. Therapy is a cultural practice of modern European-related society, which reproduces that society's gender, class, and race systems. One way a therapist can question the dominant discourses and the ways patients may be harmed by them is by use of discourse analysis. Marital conflict is analyzed using three discourses of heterosexuality: (1) the permissive discourse; (2) the male sexual drive discourse; and (3) the marriage between equals discourse. Each discourse involves reciprocal patterns for men and women, but each also favors masculine interests and needs. The case illustrates how the therapist can bring marginalized views into the therapy room and make visible the cultural narratives through which we live. Contains 27 references. (Author)",0,681

Theory predicts that a surplus of females in a dating market gives males greater bargaining power to achieve their underlying preference for avoiding committed relationships and engaging in casual sex. We find relationships between the gender composition of a high school and sexual norms and behaviors that depart from this theoretical prediction: In high schools in which girls outnumber boys, students report a less sexually permissive normative climate and girls report less casual sex compared with their counterparts at schools in which boys outnumber girls.

Makela (2010",Changes in the norms guiding alcohol use in the Finnish general population over the past 40 years.,"Attitudinal climate can be seen as a central factor influencing drinking habits; the level of consumption has been claimed to depend on how many adverse consequences of drinking a society tolerates. In the past few decades, however, only a few studies have looked at normative aspects of drinking in the general population. This article investigates changes in attitudes and norms around drinking in Finland by reviewing existing research and presenting new results. We ask whether men and women's views on alcohol differ and are there differences between age groups. The focus is on identifying long-term changes in the attitudinal climate of alcohol use. The main data is based on six national drinking habits surveys of 15-69-year olds conducted in 1968, 1976, 1984, 1992, 2000 and 2008. Data from the Scandinavian drinking survey in 1979 and the Finnish alcohol panel survey in 2003 are also used. Since the 1960s, attitudes towards one's own use of alcohol have become progressively more permissive and gender differences have converged. Results on situational norms showed that the acceptance of drinking increased in a leisure context, while there were no substantial changes in everyday and work situations. However, attitudes around alcohol policy varied through the studied time frame. In the 1970s, new liberalizations in alcohol policy induced great concerns, which settled down through the 1980s until the early 1990s. Since the end of 1990s, greater calls have been made for stricter alcohol policies, even though views on personal use of alcohol have become more permissive than ever.

She reflects first on the increasing interest with regard to research on ageing and somatic culture, and that the broader issues of 'gender blindness' and the 'paradox of the absent body' have also been evident in the sociology of sport research agenda. The challenges for this agenda can be seen in three key areas of enquiry: (1) the social dimensions and determinants of successful aging, (2) understandings of gendered bodies and the 'double standard of ageing', and (3) understandings of diversity in ageing and intersections with gender, race, ethnicity, class and sexual orientation. It is argued that future research on cultural representations of ageing in the sociology of sport need to focus on narratives, images, and media representations of ageing and somatic culture.

(2019",Intimate revelations: Conversations among “evil” women in Rokeya’s Padmarag.,"Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain creatively demonstrates in Padmarag (1924) the socially embedded association of women with evil. She brings together a group of women on the premises of Tarini Bhaban in order to explore their psychological terrain, as they share with each other previously untold memories and document their experiences of patriarchal oppression and domestic abuse. Through their reminiscences and memories, Rokeya lays bare the angst of women in a patriarchal social order that silences and suppresses them. Beyond the belief of sisterhood at Tarini Bhaban, in one way or another, most of these women are considered âevilâ in society as a whole. For example, Saudamini is a stepmother with no biological children of her own and is regarded as a dakini (witch) and rakshasi (a female demon). Other women of Tarini Bhaban have received comparable tags from society and experienced similar victimization. Based on the representation of âevilâ women in the novel, in this article I will discuss their stories and examine some of the contributing factors to their victimization and characterization as wicked in the context of early twentieth-century Bengal.

A recent meta-analysis showed that a history of sexual abuse is associated with increased risk for a lifetime diagnosis of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, sleep disorders, and suicide attempts. However, there are currently no standard therapeutic agents for treating flashbacks associated with PTSD. The NMDA receptors are crucial for synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, and glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptors plays a role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. In conclusion, we would like to propose that ifenprodil therapy could be an alternative treatment for flashbacks in adult and adolescent PTSD patients with a childhood abuse, since this drug is already in clinical use. Nonetheless, more detailed randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of ifenprodil are needed to confirm its efficacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,690

Hook-up behavior, as defined by this study, is a one-time sexual encounter between individuals that had no plans to even talk afterwards, let alone repeat the experience. Due to the ambiguity associated with hook-up experiences (Glenn & Marquardt, 2001), hook-ups were categorized into kissing, breast stimulation, genital stimulation, oral sex, anal sex, and vaginal sex. Despite the emerging interest in the ""hook-up culture"" of college campuses and the idea that students are socialized into accepting hook-ups as a norm, little, if any, research has been done on campuses with a religious affiliation. Based on moral standards, a conservative Christian campus may be expected to have a culture that is less permissive of premarital sexual activity, and this sample had a rate of 35.9% hook ups, compared to 64% at a state university. In the current sample, significant differences within hook-ups were found by sex for kissing, oral sex, and vaginal intercourse. Differences in ethnicity were also found between our data and that of prior research, suggesting that ethnicity as it relates to hooking-up is an area that needs much further study.

Methods - The patients are from the 149 new patients recruited for a double blind, randomised study of low dose levodopa-carbidopa versus low dose bromocriptine. Patients were examined neurologically at least yearly. Neuropsychological examinations were performed at 0, 3, 5, and 10 years. Mortality and cause of death in these patients were compared with the Australian population using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Mortality and disease progression were compared by sex and treatment group. Predictors of death within 10 years, nursing home admission, and progression in Columbia score of â¥ 20 points were examined by logistic regression analysis. Results - Thirteen patients were excluded as having atypical Parkinsonism and six were lost to follow up. All available patients have been followed up for 10 years. Fifty patients (38%) were dead by 10 years and 63 by the last follow up. The SMR was 1.58 for all patients (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in SMRs between the sexes. The mean duration of disease until death was 9.1 years. Parkinson's disease was thought to have contributed substantially to the death of 30 patients. The most common cause of death was pneumonia. Women progressed at a similar rate to men until 8 years, when the severity of their disease as measured by Hoehn and Yahr stage became greater (p < 0.05). Older age of onset correlated with increased risk of death but the SMR was increased even in those aged < 70 years (SMR 1.80, p = 0.03). Early use of bromocriptine did not reduce mortality or slow progression of disease. One quarter of all patients had been admitted to nursing homes by 10 years. Only four patients were still employed. Conclusions - Mortality in Parkinson's disease remains increased despite low dose levodopa-carbidopa therapy and no additional benefit was gained from early use of bromocriptine.

This proposal was tested in two studies. In the first study, 235 college students completed a questionnaire battery. About half of the students were currently in love (n = 125) and half were not (n = 110). Subjects in love were more erotic and agapic and less game-playing in their love attitudes and less permissive and instrumental in their sexual attitudes than subjects not in love. Subjects in love were also lower in self-monitoring and sensation-seeking than subjects not in love. Previously found gender main effects were replicated, and gender interacted with love status on only 2 of 26 measures. The second study used a large sample (n = 789) of subjects available from past research to examine in more detail the effects of love status on love and sex attitudes. Results replicated those from the first study. In addition, factor analyses of the six love and four sex attitude scale scores indicated that the factor structures differed for the two love status groups. In general, the results from the two studies indicated that falling in love is systematically related to broad changes on several variables.

Psychometric characteristics and associations with child and parent variables.,"Parent participation in interventions for their children's feeding problems may depend on parent attributions for the origins of these problems, but no measure is available to identify these parent perceptions. The purpose of the present paper was to develop a new Parent Attribution for Child Eating Scale (PACES), then to examine how parent perceptions measured by the PACES were associated with child variables and parent feeding practices. Participants included parents of 393 children from a hospital feeding clinic (68.2% boys; mean age = 55.4 months). Parents completed surveys to report children's demographic, medical, and feeding variables, three-point ratings for possible origins of these feeding problems, and their own use of nine child-feeding practices. Exploratory factor analysis of the parent ratings produced the 21-item PACES with four dimensions: Permissive Parenting, Medical Treatments, Oral Problems, and Vomiting Fear. The PACES showed acceptable goodness-of-fit, internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and support for its validity with expected correlations with child and parent variables. Multiple regression revealed that nine child variables (age, body mass index, gender, autism, gastrointestinal problems, neurological problems, oral motor problems, texture feeding problems, diet variety) explained 19-41% of the variance in the four PACES attributions, with oral motor problems significantly correlated with all of them (negatively with Permissive Parenting, positively with the other three), suggesting that its occurrence in combination with other child variables guides parent explanations for children's feeding problems. Multiple regression also found that Many Food Choices was the only parent feeding practice significantly correlated with all four PACES attributions (positively with Permissive Parenting, negatively with the other three), suggesting that it may be parents' primary response to attributions they develop for their children's feeding problems.

It ranges from slight approaches to rape, and involves some kind of persuasion to obtaining unwanted sexual interactions; it happens more often in dating relationships. The aim of this paper is to measure the association of sexual attitudes and the acceptance of rape myths with sexual coercion in a sample of college students, and compare these variables by sex and age. The sample was non-probabilistic and included 630 students (51% had experiences of sexual coercion); 71% of men reported practicing sexual coercion. Women who practiced sexual coercion had a less traditional sexual attitude than men (F = 21.413, p < .001), and women who faced sexual coercion had a more permissive attitude in sexual interactions (F = 37.432, p < .001). Men who faced sexual coercion blamed rape victims more than women (F = 10.603, p = .001). Younger men also blamed rape victims more than the older ones (F = 9.841, p =.002). When women use sexual coercion it seems to have a paradoxical implication regarding their gender role. It also appears to be a problem for negotiating safe sexual encounters; women who reported more sexual permissiveness seem to participate more frequently in unplanned sexual interactions and they may be more vulnerable to coercion. It is necessary to modify beliefs about abusive sexual behaviors being normal in dating relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,698

(2014",The power of sexual aesthetics: Women and girls crafting bodies.,"The Power of Sexual Aesthetics: Women and Girls Crafting Bodies examines how people of color respond creatively to being framed as sexually deviant through normative assessments of their corporeal styles in the U.S. This work comprises a comparative study of how aesthetics shape the racialization of African American, Latina, and black, non-Latina Caribbean immigrant women and girls. The dissertation constructs its argument by juxtaposing the body crafting practices of heterosexual and LBTQ young women of color I have worked with through community arts outreach, with contemporary women artists of color whose work portrays explicitly raced and sexualized bodies. Employing a multi-method approach, the study combines focus groups with young women, interviews with artists, reception study, and visual analysis of music videos, YouTube media, photographs, collages, and paintings, to fashion a transdisciplinary synthesis. Bridging Art History, Gender, Sexuality, African American, Latino/a, Critical Race, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies, the dissertation traces the circulation of raced female bodies in the visual fields of popular culture, fine art, and everyday social spaces, domains in which norms of body presentation and representation are both crystallized and challenged. Case studies of ""chonga"" girls, masculine body presenting young women, and contemporary cultural producers elaborate the modes through which racialized corporeal aesthetics are valued. This project highlights a double standard: vernacular images and embodiments of sexuality fashioned by disadvantaged girls more often draw negative critiques and cultural devaluation in social discourse when compared to more professional pictures and bodies lauded as ""edgy"" and ""innovative"" for their sexual content in the elite art world, popular culture, and media. The Power of Sexual Aesthetics analyzes how body crafting practices may work to both reveal and occult class disparity in a contemporary neoliberal context. The power of neoliberal discourse lies in its obfuscation of class exclusions and structures, and effective circulation of narratives concerning the putative potential of self-making and overcoming economic circumstances. This dissertation argues that the dissident aesthetics of poor and working class women and girls of color have the potential to unmask realities of class stratification, hence their disciplining as racially, sexually, and aesthetically excessive.

Separate pretest-posttest nonequivalent comparison group designs were utilized to assess pro gram impact along seven knowledge and attitudinal dimensions. Survey results revealed that, in comparison to no-treatment groups, the more intensive the program (a) the greater the gains in knowledge about reproductive physiology, contraception, and the consequences of teen pregnancy and parenthood (especially among experimental group females); and (b) the more birth control methods participants became familiar with over time. Changes in personal accep tance of premarital intercourse and perceived responsibility for contraception were observed only in the study examining the most intensive treatment. The results of the evaluations point to the combined importance of instructional methods, teacher quality, and in-class exposure time for producing change in young adolescentsâ knowledge of and attitudes toward sexuality. Further potential for the impact of school-based sex education programs on knowledge and attitudes is discussed within the broader context of the young adolescentâs social environment.

Furthermore, they indicated that they had experienced more positive emotions than negative emotions while viewing the production. Results suggest that theatre education may set the stage for more comprehensive interventions designed to prevent pregnancy, STDs, and AIDS. Teen theater as a nontraditional form of education combining peer education and theater in an entertaining and informative manner. The study evaluates Planned Parenthood's Teen Theater and its influence on a teenagers willingness and comfort in discussing sexual issues with others, intentions to delay intercourse, intention to use birth control, intention to protect oneself from STD's, and knowledge and affect. A pre and post test were given to 143 subjects (73 male and 70 female) who participated at 4 churches and 3 schools. Most had been recommended by youth groups. Ethnic diversity was evidenced in 54 whites, 29 blacks, 32 Hispanics, 5 Asians, 4 Native American, and 12 others not identified. Correlation matrices were constructed to assess the degree of correlation among pairs of similar items, and between affect and other dependent measures. Trends were measured by means and standard deviation; multifactorial ANOVAs were used to assess differential effects of site, gender, and ethnicity. Independent t test were used to assess differences between those who answered all questions versus those who answered few. Dependent t tests were used to assess significant changes pre and post test for discussion, comfort, intention, and knowledge variables. The results indicated sexual activity to constitute 41%of the group with a mean frequency of 2.46 for coitus. 37.9% reported having sex more than 1/week, 24.1% only once, 17.2% 1/month, 15.5% 1/week, and 5.2% 2/month. 31% reported never using birth control and 47.6% consistently used contraceptives. 21.4% reported occasional use. The pill and condom were the items of choice. ANOVAs indicated that teens responding to all questions engaged in more intercourse (t(126)=2.96, p.005). After viewing teen theater, there was more willingness to discuss sexual topics (t(80)=10.01, p.001), greater intention to use birth control (t(43)=3.02, p.01), and had greater sexual knowledge (t(92)=10.01, p.01). Significant effects on discussion, intention to use condoms and delay intercourse were not found. There was also significant relationship between affect variables and other dependent variables. In separate analysis of discussion and knowledge, each aspect was found to be significant for discussion and all but 1 knowledge item. The results suggest that the production may influence peer and parent communication as well as birth control use, albeit not a powerful intervention but moving in the direction of a more sexually responsive manner. This intervention may be used to attract larger numbers and to set the stage for more intensive interventions. Aiding teens in overcoming objections to condom use is still needed.",0,705

Cross-tabulation of respondents in terms of their professed sexual standards and their behavioral sexual standards indicates a series of meaningful types (including ""regretful celibate"" and ""reluctant nonvirgin""). Data suggest that despite increasing sexual emancipation, there was still an indication of the rating, dating, dalliance, and exploitation patterns described by W.

Francophones supported the love standard and the fun standard; the latter standard gained rapidly between the 1st and 2nd surveys. However, only 2% of Francophones reported practicing the fun standard. Findings demonstrate the speed with which sexual norms are changing across Canada.

A survey was conducted among 1,845 college students in an eastern province of China, in order to assess the pattern of Internet use among Chinese college students, to examine the relationship of Internet use and HIV knowledge and susceptibility, and to explore the relationship of online risk behaviors with sexual status, sexual intention, and sexual perceptions. Data suggest that many students used the Internet frequently and often spent long hours online. Differences between genders and across grades were observed in the patterns of students' Internet use. Male students reported much higher rates of visiting pornographic websites or engaging in other online risk behaviors. Students' HIV knowledge or susceptibility did not differ by the extent of Internet use, but online risks were positively associated with their sexual status, sexual intention, and sexual perceptions. Students who were sexually active, planned to have sex, or possessed permissive attitudes toward pre-marital sex were more likely to report online risk behaviors such as visiting pornographic sites, cyber-bullying, or distributing erotic materials via the Internet. The data underscore the importance to provide students with appropriate guidance on their Internet use, especially for reducing online risks and utilizing Internet as a source for sex education and HIV prevention.

713,"Hooley, E. M. (2018","The relationship between transmission of sexual knowledge, sexual attitude, and culture.","Purpose. Sexual knowledge is important for healthy development of adolescents and adults. Currently, there is no consistent mode of introducing the topic of sex to an individual who has not previously learned about the topic. If a shift were to occur in transmission of sexual knowledge, whether by creating a consistent mode, a culture-specific mode, or focusing on sexual attitude rather than behavior, future populations would be positively influenced. If the educational system, religious organizations, and families could be informed of an appropriate and meaningful way to communicate sexual knowledge to adolescents, negative sexual outcomes have the potential to decrease and positive sexual outcomes have the potential to increase. Method. Participants completed surveys that measured a) attitudes toward sex, b) source of sexual knowledge and influence of the source, and c) demographic information. This work employed several statistical analysis methods to answer the six research questions that guided the study. These methods included exploratory factor analysis (EFA), descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, chi-square and canonical correlation. Results. Results indicate that several of the most identified sources of sexual knowledge included school-based sexual education, parents or primary caregivers, media, internet pornography, SEEM, and friends or peers. Sources that were considered influential included parent or primary caregivers, doctors or other healthcare professionals, internet pornography, media, and friends or peers. The sexual attitudes of participants ranged from neutral (Permissiveness and Instrumentality) to moderate agreement with (Communion and Birth Control). Statistically significant differences were noted when looking at ethnicity and sources of sexual knowledge, religious affiliation during formative years and sources of sexual knowledge, gender and some sources of sexual knowledge, gender and sexual attitude, and religious affiliation during formative years and sexual attitude. Lastly, less engagement with any source of sexual knowledge indicated higher agreement with sexual attitudes of Permissiveness, Birth Control, Communion, and Instrumentality. Conclusions. This study added to the body of literature concerning how individuals learn about sex, provided a picture of sexual attitudes among a diverse group of 18-30 year old participants, and highlighted the importance of considering cultural background in attainment of sexual knowledge and sexual attitude formation. As researchers, educators, mental health professionals, and lay people better understand sexuality and sexual attitudes, they will be better able to serve the people they encounter.

(2016","Parental perceptions of play: The influences of parent gender, gender role attitudes, and parenting styles on parent attitudes toward child play.","The literature overwhelmingly demonstrates that play supports healthy social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development. Efforts to understand parents' support of child play seek to identify parent attitudes toward play, ways in which parents facilitate play for their children, and how they participate in play. Previous findings indicate parent valuation of play is an important factor for childhood play time and finds differences between mothers and fathers in parent-child play. While much research has been done to understand how mothers and fathers play with their sons and daughters, few studies have investigated what factors influence parent valuation of play or facilitate certain types of play. This study used a moderated mediation model to explore how parental attitudes about gender roles influence perceptions of play through parenting style and how this effect may be different for fathers and mothers. Analyses were also performed to understand the relationships between parent attitudes and parent play behaviors. The findings suggested egalitarian gender role attitudes predicted a higher valuation of play and more permissive mindsets toward cross-gender play for both mothers and fathers. Conversely, traditional gender role attitudes were predictive of less permissive mindsets toward cross-gender play for both mothers and fathers. A moderated mediation was found for fathers with traditional gender role attitudes and a permissive or authoritarian parenting style. Fathers with traditional gender role attitudes and a permissive parenting style were less likely to value play for child development. Fathers with traditional attitudes and an authoritarian parenting style had less permissive mindsets toward cross-gender play. Additionally for both mothers and fathers, authoritative parenting was correlated with increased parent play behaviors, while authoritarian parenting was correlated with decreased parent play behaviors. These findings support previous literature in that parent gender and gender role attitudes do appear to influence parent attitudes toward play. They also contribute to our understanding of parent gender differences and the way that parenting style influence this relationship. In addition, parenting style was found to be a facilitator of parent-child play. These findings contribute to an understanding of what kind of parents value play and can be used to inform family psychotherapy and parent education about play.

720,"Hubbard, E. K. (2010","City women sex, money, and the social order in London 1570--1640.","This dissertation explores the lives of ordinary women in early modern London, with particular attention to the cultural factors that empowered, protected, and restricted them across the life cycle. It is based primarily on the deposition books of the London consistory court: a database of roughly 2,500 female witnesses provides quantitative evidence of migration, marriage, and work patterns, while case studies of domestic service, courtship, unwed pregnancy, household and neighborhood politics, work, widowhood, remarriage, and old age are drawn from testimony. Ballads and prescriptive texts provide additional context. Attracted by London's relatively high wages and advantageous marriage market, thousands of Englishwomen migrated to the capital, where they served as maidservants before almost universally marrying. As adult women, they strove to keep precarious household economies afloat and to compete for status in the neighborhood. Widows, the beneficiaries of favorable inheritance laws, were also often able to remarry, and demonstrated a preference for younger husbands. The importance of economic order in the lives of women is a key concept of this study. While male anxieties about women as sexual agents are well known, insufficient attention has been paid to the economic anxieties that often trumped sex as a source of concern. Not only was preserving a fragile material order a constant preoccupation for women, but the choices of magistrates and neighbors show that they cared more about maintaining economic stability in households and neighborhoods than they did about enforcing a sexual double standard. This economic focus could work to women's advantage: widespread unwillingness to pay through poor rates for other men's misdeeds meant that pregnant maidservants could legally assign the paternity of their unborn children and demand support, while the wives of thriftless, violent drunkards could often count on the sympathetic intervention of disapproving neighbors. However, when economic concerns went hand in hand with a rigid gender order, women faced strict limits. Women's work was highly circumscribed, not by social discomfort with women in the public sphere, but by the perception that their participation in the regulated trades menaced the stability of male workers' households.

Areas of scientific discourse are identified, associated with a ""modernization"" of mores and based on secular and progressive assumptions. The conflict between biological or endocrinological approaches and psychoanalytical methods is discussed, with encouragement of a healthy, aware experience of sexuality becoming established as the central argument.

Memantine is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease by the Food and Drug Administration. The efficacy of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, was determined in two double-blind studies involving more than 650 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Side effects reported with the use of memantine include dizziness, headache, and constipation, which occurred in 7% of patients. Gepirone extended-release (ER), a once-daily serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist, was shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and high ratings of anxiety. Gepirone ER produced an early, sustained response to anxiety and was effective in treating the psychic and somatic symptoms of anxiety that often accompany MDD. Sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction, which are common antidepressant side effects, did not emerge as side effects associated with gepirone. Gepirone's side-effect profile may be particularly attractive for individuals with such previous problems on standard, first-line antidepressants. Primary care physicians and psychiatrists treat many outpatients with mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms, whether or not they meet criteria for MDD. This suggests that gepirone may be a novel antidepressant agent with good antianxiety as well as antidepressant effects.

Similarly, perceived descriptive norms were among the strongest predictors of alcohol use with the final model explaining 69% of the variance. Future research may want to use both of these perceived norms constructs to create a more salient and targeted social norms intervention aimed at reducing risky behavior and permissive alcohol-related attitudes among this population.

This, however, is largely a matter of living in glass houses and throwing stones. While the wearing of laces, bright colors, jewels, and cosmetics is considered effeminate today, in the past no such double standard held. Then, men usually surpassed women in the elaborateness of their clothing, and even today, among the savages and in many of the Oriental nations, the men are more highly decorated than the women. In order to understand the relation of fashion to sex, one must understand the relative position of man and woman among civilized and uncivilized peoples. Nor is this adequate. To appreciate fully the relationship, one must glance at the higher animals to see what nature has provided for the two sexes.

Exploratory factorial analysis showed three factors which explained 45.56% of total variance, nevertheless, this solution reflects a methodological artifact due to items redaction. For this reason, original unifactorial structure of the scale was maintained, which reaches an internal consistency reliability value equals .89. No statistically significant differences between men and women were found on the total score, but were found on 11 items. Furthermore, sexual satisfaction positively correlates with dyadic sexual desire and with sexual arousability, and negatively with sexual double standard. The Spanish version of the Index of Sexual Satisfaction shows appropriate reliability and validity indexes, nevertheless, more studies analyzing item 13, which was problematic on this study, are needed.

731,"Iijima Hall, C. C. (1995",Asian eyes: Body image and eating disorders of asian and asian american women.,"Attractiveness1 and beauty have been found to be the most important factors in prompting relationships and interactions, and for making social judgments. Standards of beauty in America, however, are primarily based on Caucasian-European-American ideals. Society is deluged with this beauty ideal constantly through media. People furthest from this ideal, specifically women of color, may suffer the psychological effects of low self-esteem, poor body image, and eating disorders. Research on body image and eating disorders has been exclusively conducted on white women; little research or conceptual work has included women of color. This paper sets a beginning foundation for understanding body image and eating disorders in Asian and Asian American women. In addition, the social-political image of Asian and Asian American women is addressed. Asian and Asian American women are victims of the âdouble jeopardy âof racism and sexism.

732,"Jagodzinski, W. and K. Manabe (2009",,"Underlying all international survey programs is the conviction that cultures can be compared. In the empirical analyses, comparability problems are either ignored or analyzed in terms of measurement equivalence. Criteria of metric and scale equivalence are so strict, however, that they often lead to a double reduction - a reduction of the number of indicators and a reduction of the number of countries. As a consequence of these reductions, the meaning of the broad theoretical concepts is often narrowed. This empirical analysis on religiosity attempts to overcome these limitations, first by defining softer criteria of comparability. We consider a theoretical concept as fruitful if its relationships to the multiple indicators as well as to other independent and dependent variables are sufficiently similar to each other in all countries under investigation. In the early stage of comparative researchonly a moderate degree of similarity should be required. In applying this standard, it turns out that the various aspects of religiosity have to be specified by different concepts. Religiosity therefore rather designates a conceptual framework than a single concept. The concepts we use display an astonishing degree of similarity. Not only can they be reliably measured but most ofthem are also similarly related to gender, age, education, happiness, sexual morality and volunteering in almost all ISSP countries. This is particularly true for a two-item index of religious involvement. Â© 2009 Max Haller, Roger Jowell and Tom W. Smith for selection and editorial matter. All rights reserved.",0,732
733,"James, S. J. (2013","Marie Corelli and the value of literary self-consciouness: The sorrows of satan, popular fiction, and the fin-de-siècle canon.","Marie Corelli's The Sorrows of Satan (1895) presents a paradoxical test case for the practice of academic literary criticism. The best-selling work of fiction of the nineteenth century, the book was demeaned by Victorian critics and has been long ignored by criticism since. In spite of Corelli's recent mini-revival, the formally self-conscious properties of this work deserve further examination: the text insistently foregrounds the act of literary criticism and demands that the reader's attention is focussed on not only the content of the narrative but also the nature of the procedure of reading. Such a strategy allows Corelli's romance to participate safely in the kinds of literary transgressions enacted in the work of her since-canonized contemporaries such as Thomas Hardy and Oscar Wilde. The narrative mode warns against the production of the wrong kinds of readings of the narrative, inoculating its consumer against the corruption suffered by many of Sorrows's characters-and by the readers of the kinds of contemporary fiction Corelli seeks to warn against. As a consequence, The Sorrows of Satan, while exiled from the canon, shows itself to be surprisingly representative of the image of fin-de-siÃ¨cle literary culture constructed by its afterlife. Like so many 1890s fictions, it is a work of art about the work of art, and dramatizes such by now familiar late-Victorian tropes as: decadence, moral relativism, debates over literary taste, realism, post-Ibsen drama, the sexual double standard, the marriage market, the New Woman, motherhood, hysteria and female pathologies, degeneration anxiety, mesmerism. The Sorrows of Satan's status as forgotten best-seller, a great bad book, asks difficult questions about the relationship between literary criticism and literary pleasure.

735,"Januszewski, B. A. (1997",Associations between attachment representations and patterns of sexuality.,"Despite the increased public awareness of health problems associated with high-risk sexual behavior, we do not fully understand the interpersonal dynamics of sexual behavior in late adolescence. Internal working models of attachment are based on childhood attachment experiences, and are thought to be associated with one's capacity for emotional intimacy in adolescent sexual relationships, and therefore sexual behavior patterns in adolescent romantic relationships. In this study, we examined the association between working models of attachment and sociosexual orientation (i.e., the extent to which one has emotional intimacy in sexual relationships), sexual attitudes (i.e., Permissiveness, Communion, and Instrumentality), and sexual concerns. The present sample consisted of 22 African-American and 20 European-American late adolescent (ages 18-26) community college students. Measures included the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) (George, Kaplan, & Main, 1985), the Sexual Attitudes Scale (Hendrick & Hendrick, 1987), the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (Simpson & Gangestead, 1991), and the Sexual Concerns Questionnaire which was designed by the author for this study. As predicted, within both ethnic groups, results indicated that Dismissing adolescents held less restricted (i.e., more permissive) sociosexual attitudes than Secure/Autonomous adolescents (and than Preoccupied adolescents for the African-American sample only). However, there were no significant differences among those with different working models of attachment on measures of sociosexual behavior, valuing emotional intimacy, or utilizing an instrumental approach to sexuality. Within the African-American sample, Preoccupied and Secure/Autonomous adolescents reported experiencing orgasmic difficulty more frequently than Dismissing adolescents. This is consistent with prior findings that Preoccupied individuals report greater distress in a variety of domains (i.e., Kobak & Sceery, 1988). Nevertheless, the findings about the link between attachment and sociosexual orientation must be qualified. The present sample had a confound between gender and attachment, in that females were more frequently represented in the Secure/Autonomous category, and males were more frequently represented in the Dismissing category. Given that males tend to have more unrestricted sociosexual behavior patterns, these findings cannot unequivocally be attributed to working models of attachment. Also, the small sample size did not permit tests of the interaction between gender and attachment. Ideas for future research include phenomenological approaches to the study of attachment in African Americans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,735
736,"Jarzabek, M. G. J. (1996",,"As the community of communication educators struggles to resolve many issues within its ranks, the question of gender bias in the world of debate, and beyond, continues to be raised. Stereotypical socialization, with women as nurturing/submissive and men as dominant/aggressive, begins early and continues throughout life, and the educator is part of this process. When gender differences are examined in a competitive event such as a debate, the line is quickly crossed between gender stereotype and sexual harassment. A study by Bruschke and Johnson (1994), which included female students and judges, showed that this stereotyping is firmly set in the minds of males and females alike. A specific course of action for educators is suggested: (1) student and coach must become aware of and discuss the different ways in which men and women communicate--videos are excellent for this; (2) the class should review the legal definitions of sexual harassment; and (3) the instructor should make it clear that harassment claims will be given immediate and serious attention and a clearly stated policy of behavior should be in place, with a specific course of redress.

The authors use a special case of multiple standards-gender-based double standards-to illustrate the framework and focus on judgments of just earnings, using data collected by G. Jasso and P. H. Rossi (1977). Two main sets of analyses were used, the 1st focusing on the double standard and the 2nd on the mechanisms by which the double standard operates. Results show that, in a probability sample of white adults living in Baltimore in 1974, judgements of earnings for unmarried workers reflect the gender-based double standard.

The means for permissive and nonpermissive females were similar, but for males the nonpermissive Ss had dramatically lower intercourse frequency.

Besides serving the national interest with her artistic accomplishments as a yeoak (female court artist), her duties were to provide the men of the yangban (aristocratic) class with a medium of social life and sexual pleasure. However, by the late Joseon period, the image of the chaste lady started to define the dominant representation of the ginyeo. ""Virtuous ginyeo"" who seemed to possess the self-consciousness of the yangban class began to appear. This chaste ginyeo has been admired as a paragon of Confucian virtue This new icon of the ""virtuous ginyeo"" not only shows that Confucian hegemony had spread to the sphere of everyday life, but also presents a sexual double standard for women of this social class. In particular, the mixed selfconsciousness of ""virtuous ginyeo"" is a historical index of the liminality of the ginyeo maximized at the point where the formula of desire intersects the dual functioning of gender in Joseon society.

Aim: Assess erection hardness and its correlation with sexual function, emotional well-being, and satisfaction (erection quality, intercourse, sex life, sexual relationship, and treatment). Methods: Men with ED were randomized to double-blind, flexible-dose sildenafil (25, 50, or 100 mg) or placebo (6 weeks) with open-label extension (6 weeks). Main Outcome Measures: Erection Hardness Score (EHS), Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Self-Esteem And Relationship (SEAR) questionnaire, and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS). Results: A total of 307 men (mean [range] age, 45 [18-55] years) were randomized to sildenafil (N = 154) or placebo (N = 153).

Peritraumatic tonic immobility has been reported in convenience samples of female victims of sexual assault and in mixed-gender victims of different types of trauma. This study evaluated peritraumatic tonic immobility in a representative general population sample and its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and gender. METHODS: 3231 victims of traumatic events aged 15-75 years responded to the Tonic Immobility Scale. PTSD and traumatic events were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). We calculated the means and the standard deviations of Tonic Immobility Scale scores stratified by PTSD and gender. The association between tonic immobility scores and gender was explored controlling for potential confounders through a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: Tonic immobility scores were more than double in those who met criteria for PTSD and were almost four points higher in women. Gender differences remained statistically significant even after adjustment for confounding variables. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional and retrospective design may have given rise to recall bias. Results presented here may not apply to small and medium rural areas and the CIDI 2.1 can lead to a certain degree of misclassification.

(2018",Experiences of sexual harassment are associated with the sexual behavior of 14- to 18-year-old adolescents.,"Subjection to sexual harassment is associated with a number of negative outcomes, such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms and a disinclination to attend school. Among adolescents, sexual harassment may increase with both their emerging sexual desires and increased socializing in mixed-gender peer groups during early adolescence. We set out to study the possible associations between normative and risk-taking sexual behavior and subjection to sexual harassment among adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The informants included 90,953 boys and 91,746 girls, with a mean (SD) age of 16.3 (1.2) years, who responded to a classroom survey (School Health Promotion Study 2010â2011) in Finland. We found that even early steps in romantic and erotic experiences were associated with experiences of sexual harassment. The more advanced the adolescentsâ sexual experiences were, the more commonly they reported differing experiences of sexual harassment. These associations were particularly strong among the girls. Among the sexually active adolescents, the more partners the adolescents had for intercourse, the more commonly they reported experiences of sexual harassment. Adolescents actively interested in romantic and sexual relationships may socialize in contexts where sexual harassment is more likely to occur. They may be more sensitive to sexual cues than their non-interested peers, or sexual harassment may be a traumatic experience predisposing adolescents to risk-taking sexual behavior as a form of acting out. A double standard regarding the appropriate expression of sexuality received some support in our data. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,750

Study goals were to examine trajectories of number of sexual partners across adolescence and into early adulthood, and to investigate hypothesized individual and family-level predictors. Methods: A subset of 8,707 white, black, and Mexican American participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health reported on their motivations to have sex, family warmth, and perceptions of maternal attitudes about sex at Wave 1 and on their sexual relationships at each year of age across the three waves of the study. Results: Multilevel growth curves of number of sexual partners between ages 11 and 27 showed increases in sexual risk across adolescence and deceleration in early adulthood, but differed somewhat as a function of demographic characteristics. As expected, adolescent motivations to have sex and perceptions of permissive maternal attitudes about sex predicted more sexual partners in adolescence, whereas family warmth predicted fewer sexual partners across gender and racial/ethnic groups. Predictors did not differentiate youth as strongly in early adulthood. Interactions between predictors supported a cumulative risk framework, such that perceived permissive maternal attitudes or low family warmth combined with high adolescent motivations to have sex predicted the highest number of sexual partners in adolescence. Conclusions: This study advances our understanding of change in sexual behavior across development and the individual and contextual correlates of such change. Findings document the cumulative implications of individual cognitions, family experiences, and social contexts for adolescent and young adult sexual experiences.

Findings suggest that most priest-respondents believed that the media had accurately reported that the bishops had engaged in a cover-up.

Most priest-respondents believed the response of the USCCB was inadequate, poorly conceived, and generated to satisfy public pressure.

In a six-week double-blind study, 50 patients with PCOS and MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria) with Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) score of <20, randomly received pioglitazone (15mg twice daily; PO) or metformin (750mg twice daily; PO). Assessment was done using HDRS (weeks 0, 3, 6) together with fasting Insulin, glucose, and lipid profile, liver enzymes, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), anthropometric measures, and serum androgens (weeks 0 and 6). Pioglitazone was superior to metformin in reducing HDRS scores at the end of the study [38.3% versus 8.3% reduction from baseline scores, F(1, 37) = 73.513, P < 0.001]. Changes from baseline in HOMA-IR values at week 6 were not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.888). Baseline (but not follow-up) HDRS and HOMA-IR values were significantly correlated (r = 0.393, P = 0.012). In multiple regression analysis, treatment with pioglitazone independent of HOMA-IR values predicted greater score reduction on HDRS at week 6 (standardized beta = 0.801, P < 0.001). Biochemical and hormonal profile did not differ between the two groups at week 6. Metformin was associated with higher frequency of gastrointestinal side effects (P = 0.014). In summary, we showed that pioglitazone improved depression with mechanisms largely unrelated to its insulin-sensitizing action (registration number: IRCT201106081556N23).

754,"Kasten, K. (1972",Toward a psychology of being: A masculine mystique.,"Criticizes humanistic psychologists for not confronting the problem of sex role stereotypes. It is noted that many of Maslow's assumptions about human potential contradict the contemporary desire of women to divest themselves of their sexual role, as also the desirability of eliminating artificial sex roles altogether. Maslow's conception of the self-actualizer is viewed as being merely a new edition of an old prototype: the masculine saint-hero. His approach to sexuality is considered naive, and he is said to totally ignore the adjustment to sex roles, thereby tendering his tacit approval of it. In therapy, the humanist approach is considered to incorporate a double standard of mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,754

Severely obese subjects receiving laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) surgery in 2009 (n = 11,769) were identified. Utilization of medical services and pharmaceuticals in the 3.5 years before surgery were ascertained for each severely obese subject through linkage with Medicare, Australia's universal health insurance scheme. Equivalent data were retrieved for each subject from the matched general population sample (n = 140,000). Severely obese subjects utilized significantly more medical services annually compared to the general population (mean: 22.8 vs. 12.1/person, standardized incidence ratio (SIR): 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88-1.89)), translating to twofold higher mean annual costs (Australian $1,140 vs. $567/person). The greatest excess costs in the obese related to consultations with general practitioners, psychiatrists/psychologists and other specialists, investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, and in vitro fertilization. Severely obese subjects also utilized significantly more pharmaceutical prescriptions annually (mean: 11.4 vs. 5.3/person, SIR 2.18 (95% CI: 2.17-2.19)), translating to 2.2-fold higher mean annual costs ($595/person vs. $270/person). The greatest excess costs in the obese related to diabetes drugs, lipid-modifying agents, psychoanaleptics, acid-related disorder drugs, agents acting on the rennin-angiotensin system, immunosuppressants, and obstructive airway disease drugs. Overall, healthcare costs in the severely obese population were more than double those incurred by the general population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,755
756,"Kelley, J., et al. (1993",Moral reasoning and political conflict: the abortion controversy.,"We argue that the abortion controversy has one major source--religion--and two less important ones--attitudes towards sexual permissiveness and women's employment. Traditional Christianity promotes opposition to abortion using three distinct modes of moral reasoning: through deductive moral reasoning, by the Christian world view's implication that abortion violates the sanctity of life and is a rebellion against God's design; through authoritative moral reasoning by appeal to Catholic dogma; and through consequentialist moral reasoning, as a means of control over sexuality and as a means of confining women's activities to the home. Even aside from Christian belief, adherence to traditional morality promotes opposition to abortion on these consequentialist grounds. We posit a model in which religious belief, anti-feminism, sexual permissiveness, and attitudes towards abortion are distinct concepts (a four-factor model) rather than all simply aspects of a single conservatism factor. We develop reliable, multiple item attitude scales; show that our four-factor model fits the data much better than the one-factor alternative; and test our hypotheses on new data from a large, representative national sample of Australia (N = 4540). Using maximum likelihood structural equation methods, we find that deductive reasoning from Christian belief is the most important source of opposition to abortion, with strong effects both direct and indirect. Exposure to the authority of the Catholic hierarchy is a real but weaker source of opposition. Consequentialist reasoning from traditional moral views on sex--partly buttressed by religion, partly independent of it--is also influential. But views on women's employment matter only a little, contrary to received wisdom.",0,756

This research uses multi-level modeling to investigate the context of unprotected sex among heterosexually active homeless men in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. Based on interviews with 305 randomly selected men who discussed 665 of their recent female sexual relationships, this project investigates the correlates of unprotected sex during the past 6 months at the partnership, individual, and social network levels. Several different measures of relationship closeness and lack of communication about HIV/condoms were associated with unprotected sex. Controlling for relationship factors, men's negative attitudes towards condoms, mental health, and higher number of male sex partners also were associated with having unprotected sex with female partners.

A sample of 246 heterosexual female undergraduates who had been in an intimate relationship recently or at the time of this study completed measures of general and sexual resourcefulness, sexual self-efficacy, reasons for consenting to unwanted sexual advances, endorsement of traditional gender norms, relationship satisfaction, and frequency of consenting to unwanted sexual activities. Higher general resourcefulness and sexual self-efficacy scores and fewer reasons for consenting to unwanted sexual advances were direct predictors of higher sexual resourcefulness scores. Women who were more sexually resourceful, had fewer reasons for consenting to unwanted sexual activity, and were happier in their relationship were more likely to report a lower frequency of sexual compliance. Endorsement of traditional gender norms and sexual resourcefulness, however, moderated the relationship between sexual compliance and relationship satisfaction. Less sexually resourceful women who strongly endorsed traditional gender roles were far more likely to consent to unwanted sexual activities, when relationship satisfaction was low, in comparison to all the other groups.

Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Clinical research center in Connecticut. Participants: Healthy, community-dwelling women aged 65 and older (n = 167). Intervention: Eligible women were randomly assigned to treatment with 0.25 mg 17-beta estradiol or placebo for 36 months. All women (estradiol or placebo) with an intact uterus received micronized progesterone l00mg/d for 2 weeks every 6 months. All participants received 1,300 mg elemental calcium with 1,000 IU vitamin D per day. Measurements: Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), lean body mass (LBM), and percentage body fat were measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry. Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle mass (ASM/height2) 2 standard deviations or less than young, healthy reference population mean. Physical activity (Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly (PASE)) and performance were measured. Serum estrone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia at baseline was 13%. There were no baseline differences between groups except for PASE score and chair rise time, in which the estrogen group had better performance. No changes in ASM, LBM, percentage of body fat, or physical performance were found after 3 years of estrogen therapy. Conclusion: Sarcopenia was present in 13% of this group of community-dwelling, postmenopausal older women. Ultra-low-dose estrogen therapy neither improves nor harms ASM. Similarly, no changes in body fat or physical performance were detected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,760
761,"Killen, M., et al.

Design: A homogeneous sample of parents and nonparental adults (N = 80) participated to control for social experience beyond parental status. Participants were interviewed about whether it was acceptable for parents to allow their sons and daughters to engage in gender consistent (boy plays baseball, girl takes ballet), gender inconsistent (boy takes ballet, girl plays baseball), and gender neutral (boy goes to a sleepover, girl goes to a sleepover) peer activities, along with questions about autonomy, gender preferences, parental jurisdiction, cultural change, and stereotype knowledge. Results: Whereas all participants promoted autonomy, parents were more likely to sacrifice autonomy to conform to gender Stereotypic expectations than were nonparental adults and to use social-conventional reasoning to justify their evaluations. Parents were more likely than nonparental adults to promote boys' autonomy than girls' autonomy in the absence of Stereotypic expectations but were less likely to do so in gender inconsistent contexts. Conclusions: Korean parents and nonparental adults differ in their decisions about children's engagement in gender related peer activities. In contrast to nonparental adults, parents used multiple forms of social reasoning when evaluating children's autonomy in the context of gender expectations. These findings shed light on the complex decision-making that parents engage in when granting children autonomy and promoting social development.

Among them, 2,336 subjects were invited to participate in the Phase II diagnostic assessment for dementia and MCI, and 1,673 subjects responded (response rate = 71.6%). Diagnostic assessments were administered using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet (CERAD-K) Clinical Assessment Battery. The CERAD-K Neuropsychological Assessment Battery was used for diagnosing MCI. Age-, gender-, education-, and urbanicity-standardized prevalence of dementia was estimated to be 8.1% (95% CI = 6.9-9.2) for overall dementia and 24.1% (95% CI = 21.0-27.2) for MCI. Alzheimer's disease (AD) was the most prevalent type (5.7%) followed by vascular dementia (2.0%). Amnestic subtype (20.1%) was much more prevalent than nonamnestic subtype in MCI (4.0%). Older age, being male, lower education level, illiteracy, smoking, and histories of head trauma or depression were associated with increased dementia risk, and alcohol use and moderately intense exercise were associated with decreased dementia risk. We expect numbers of dementia patients to double every 20 years until 2050 in Korea and expect AD to account for progressively more dementia cases in the future. Â© 2011 IOS Press and the authors.

Participants (N = 110) were adult male and female nicotine-dependent smokers who expressed interest in quitting smoking. All subjects received six sessions of behavioral counseling (1 hr/session for 6 weeks), and 1 month of the nicotine patch (21 mg for the first 2 weeks, 14 mg the third week, 7 mg the fourth week). Subjects were randomly assigned to the naltrexone or placebo group. The naltrexone group started at 25 mg daily for 3 days prior to the quit date, and increased to 50 mg/day on the quit date and following 8 weeks. At the end of medication treatment, the naltrexone group had better quit rates versus the placebo group (48% quit on naltrexone vs. 41% on placebo), but this difference was not statistically significant. However, men and women differed on several measures: in the placebo group, women had significantly lower quit rates than men (39% vs. 67%, p<.05), but in the naltrexone group, women had quit rates comparable with those of men (58% vs. 62%, p = ns). Further examination revealed that naltrexone significantly reduced men's and women's cessation-related weight gain and selectively reduced women's urge to smoke to relieve negative affect and withdrawal. The results suggest continued examination of naltrexone as an adjunct in smoking cessation, particularly in female smokers, who have historically shown worse outcomes with traditional treatment methods.

However, alcohol's effects on specific components of smoking behavior for nicotine versus non-nicotine factors and potential sex differences in this response have not been investigated. Methods: Forty-two young male and female non-dependent, heavy social drinking smokers participated in two double-blind laboratory sessions. They were randomized to either an alcohol (0.8 g/kg; n = 29) or placebo (n = 13) beverage pre-administration group. After beverage consumption, they were assessed for smoking urges and then given the opportunity to smoke cigarettes which were either all nicotinized (0.6 mg/cigarette) or denicotinized (<=0.05 mg/cigarette) over a 3-h period; smoking behavior was quantified by a smoking topography device. Subjects took standardized puffs of the session's cigarette both before and after beverage administration to provide a reference when making future smoking choices. Results: Alcohol, compared with placebo beverage, increased both men's and women's smoking urge, as well as subjective ratings of smoking reference puffs for either nicotinized or denicotinized cigarettes. In terms of smoking choice behavior, regardless of cigarette type, alcohol (>placebo) increased men's smoking behavior, including puff count, volume, and duration. In contrast, for women, smoking topography measures did not differ between alcohol and placebo conditions. Discussion: In summary regardless of nicotine content, in men, alcohol increased smoking urge and behavior, whereas in women, alcohol increased smoking urge but did not increase smoking behavior. These results indicate that the mechanisms underlying co-use of alcohol and tobacco in women may be more complex than in men. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,764

Double standards theory predicts that people use different standards for making inferences about othersâ abilities based on social status. Social identity processes, however, imply that people evaluate in-group members more positively than out-group members. We analyze cross-sectional dyadic peer nomination data from 21 primary school classes in Hungary (N = 392, (Formula presented.) = 13 years) with exponential random graph models. Next to ethnic self-identification, we use dyadic ethnic perceptions as a novel way of measuring ethnicity in the analysis. Our findings are mostly in line with social identity theory: Students are more likely to nominate in-group peers as clever compared with classmates from the out-group, in terms of both gender and ethnicity. Nonetheless, ethnic and gender biases in ability perceptions differ in some important ways. Â© The Author(s) 2018.",0,765

767,"Kittler, R. and S. Darula (2008","The historic importance of solar geometry for orientation in time, space and in architecture.","Nowadays in an era of digital watches, computers and theodolites, this paper's title might seem curious. However, the daily and yearly sun-path and solar coordinates are still very good indicators of the determination of time and orientation. The greatest invention of the first Sumer civilisation and culture inherited by mankind over the last 4000 years is the sexagesimal system of measuring time and space introduced in Ur around 2780 BC. A year consisting of twelve months with thirty days in each and yielding 360 days was standardised by Ur king Dungi I in 2650 BC. After gnomonic studies utilising the equinox day, the four cardinal points and planar orientation of 360 degrees and 180 degrees in the sky vault was simultaneously adopted. The equal day time and night time period in an equinox day defined two times six double-hours in one day. At the same time, ancient Egyptians taking into account Sumerian and their own life experiences, particularly with regards to the Nile flood cycles, introduced a more precise solar year of 365 days. Also the space orientation to cardinal points was seen to be applied in early graves and mastabas and even later in the pyramids as well. The first known architect Imhotep, the stone builder of pharaoh Dzoser's first step pyramid, certainly was familiar with the foundation ceremony and the ""stretching of the cord"" rule to orientate pyramid sides to N, S, E and W. Four possibilities could be used for the determination of the precise plan orientation, as documented by the Great Pyramid of Giza which has a deviation from the South of only 3 angular minutes. Because trigonometrical knowledge in ancient Egypt was reduced to the proportion of the sides of a right angled triangle especially that of sides 3-4-5, the vertical stick/gnomon g and its equinox noon shadow length s were taken as determining the solar altitude angle in the ratios s / g. Coincidentally, Ur and Alexandria have the same geographical latitude circa 31Â°N, these locales having the same s / g = 3:5, the ratio defining the noon equinox sunshadow. Later Marcus Vitruvius Polio mentioned this ratio for Alexandria in his first known textbook on ""De Architectura"" with other ratios for Athens, Rome, Taranto and Rhodes Island. In his first book, writing on wind orientation, Vitruvius described also the old Indian and rhomboidal method of N-S direction predictions. In the ninth book about astronomy and sundials he explained the solar geometry further in the so called analemma rule with the construction of a solar ecliptic at the summer and winter solstice as 1/ 15 of the circle i. e. 360Â°/15=24Â° and the monthly sun-paths. He indicated also the hour angle 15Â° as a basic interval for sundial design. Claudius Ptolemaios/Ptolemy from Alexandria summarized the ancient Greek knowledge in trigonometry and astronomy in the 2nd Century AD in his book Megale syntaxis (The great system), later to be found in its Arabic version know as the Almagest. Thefirst indication of sine functions with ratio tables was developed by a Hindu mathematician Aryabhate around 500 AD which enabled the definition of the value of solar altitude. Gnomon shade studies by a Tajikistan astronomer Abu-l-VÃ¡fÃ¡ in the 10th Century resulted in the 1Â° tables of cotangent functions also importantfor the calculation of solar coordinates. Jan Regiomontanus (Muller) a famous medieval astronomer and mathematician, during his stay in Rome, translated Ptolemy's Almagest and studied trigonometry. Later he taught at the Faculty of Arts at Academia Istropolitana in Bratislava (1467-1471) and wrote the first separate treatise of trigonometry ""De triangulis omnimodis libri quinque"" and introduced the tangent function in Europe. Solar geometry expressed by trigonometric functions is nowadays applied in many graphical tools and computer programs. These enable the prediction of daylighting and insolation in architectural and urban designs as well as the utilisation of solar energy.",0,767

Design: The study is based on in-depth individual and focus groups interviews with young adults from rural and urban areas in Estonia, supported by participant observation. Results: Women's drinking still carries a clear, albeit contested, double standard. Young men, on the other hand, contest the traditional masculine drinking norms and distance themselves from the heavy drinking practices of drinking to intoxication and drinking vodka, which are connected with images of Soviet-era (inflexible rural) masculinity. Conclusion: In creating alternative modes of masculinity and femininity, young adults stress independence, individualism and being active agents in the reconstruction of their gendered identities.

District decisions to offer FLE were reported to be most strongly influenced by school faculty and administrators while the decision not to offer FLE was most strongly influenced by clergy and special interest groups. More than half of the FLE teachers who returned surveys taught FLE as a unit within another course. Teachers generally covered a variety of curriculum topics, with units/courses most likely to address human development, physiology and sexual disease and least likely to deal with valueâladen topics such as premarital intercourse, sexual behavior and sexual preference.

The study featured the perception of a team leader during a team-meeting presented in a masked video-clip and either labeled as Mr. K or Mrs. K (Goldberg-paradigm study). Results suggested that the assumption of the leader's gender (gender-assumption) had a systematic impact on trait-ratings of the leader in the unexpected direction that ""women"" were rated higher on agentic traits than ""men."" This was interpreted as an expectancy-based double-standard effect in leadership perception on the basis of nonverbal cue utilization. Furthermore, differences in the predictive values of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic cues were suggested in the analysis of verbal cue utilization. Overall, the lens-model perspective provides a useful framework by making perceptual and behavioral processes of gender construction more transparent.

773,"Konkol, S. M. (2013","Someone's in the Kitchen, Where's Dinah? Gendered Dimensions of the Professional Culinary World.","Traditionally cooking is considered to be women's work, yet the vast majority of professional chefs, particularly in the upper echelons of restaurant work, are men. These curious gendered patterns stimulated interest in delving more deeply into the gendered nature of restaurant work. Existing research on this topic has concentrated on the front of the house (dining room) but has not addressed the gendered nature of the male-dominated back of the house (kitchen). This study looks at the gendered nature of the professional culinary kitchen (back of the house), how gender relations are constructed through culinary education and in the professional kitchen, and specifically how gender is done in culinary education and the professional culinary kitchen. The inquiry focuses on three research questions: How does gender present itself in the culinary world, how does chef education challenge or contribute to the normative gendered patterns in the culinary world, specifically the back of the house, and how do the experiences of women chefs perpetuate or contest gender binaries? Using a life history methodology, I interviewed four women executive chefs to collect data about how they experienced the professional culinary kitchen with particular attention to the gendered nature of that experience. In culinary school, the four women chefs felt that both men and women students were treated equally, but in the professional culinary kitchen, they soon found out that the gendered nature of work was not equal; it favored men, making promotion very difficult for women seeking executive chef positions. To understand the data, a feminist post-structural theoretical framework, focusing on difference, language, discourse, power and knowledge, was used as an analytical lens. Patriarchal discourses permeate home, educational and workplace domains where gender stereotypes and double standards made it difficult for the women chefs to navigate the professional culinary world as well as work/life balance. Binary ways of thinking (masculine/feminine) privilege men over women, yet these women chefs have found spaces where they can thrive using their own strengths and resilience to have successful careers in the professional culinary world.

(2002",Trends and countertrends in sexual permissiveness: Three decades of attitude change in the Netherlands 1965-1995.,"Using longitudinal data from 8 surveys on attitude change in the Netherlands, trends in sexual permissiveness since the 1960s were examined. All of these surveys employed representative samples of the Dutch adult population (aged 21-70 yrs). In explaining attitude change, time-period effects proved most important, whereas cohort replacement appeared to be of minor significance. Hence, changing attitudes toward permissiveness are best understood in terms of structural developments (period effects) through which everybody in society is affected. Furthermore, this study found that churches are successful in keeping their members from developing progressive opinions. With respect to age, the growing-conservative-when-growing-older argument also holds for sexual permissiveness. A description of gender-specific trends reveals that gender differences were relatively constant over time. Only with respect to ""sex before marriage in a stable relationship"", was a convergence of the gap established. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,775

Recently, it was shown that statin-mediated inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase restores the cognitive deficits in an NF1 mouse model. Objective: To determine the effect of simvastatin on neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological outcome measures in children with NF1. Design, Setting, and Participants: Sixty-two of 114 eligible children (54%) with NF1 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between January 20, 2006, and February 8, 2007, at an NF1 referral center at a Dutch university hospital. Intervention: Simvastatin or placebo treatment once daily for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were scores on a Rey complex figure test (delayed recall), cancellation test (speed), prism adaptation, and the mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient based on magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcome measures were scores on the cancellation test (standard deviation), Stroop color word test, block design, object assembly, Rey complex figure test (copy), Beery developmental test of visual-motor integration, and judgment of line orientation. Scores were corrected for baseline performance, age, and sex. Results: No significant differences were observed between the simvastatin and placebo groups on any primary outcome measure: Rey complex figure test (beta = 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.36 to 0.56); cancellation test (beta = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.67 to 0.29); prism adaptation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.55 to 7.37); and mean brain apparent diffusion coefficient (beta = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.20). In the secondary outcome measures, we found a significant improvement in the simvastatin group in object assembly scores (beta = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.01), which was specifically observed in children with poor baseline performance (beta = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.30). Other secondary outcome measures revealed no significant effect of simvastatin treatment. Conclusion: In this 12-week trial, simvastatin did not improve cognitive function in children with NF1.

Scurich (2014",The impact of case factors on jurors' decisions in a sexual violent predator hearing.,"Twenty states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government allow for the postincarceration, indeterminate civil commitment of sexual violent predators (SVPs). Yet, although a large number of individuals has been committed under these laws, relatively little is known about how jurors make decisions in these proceedings. Using a sample of 274 jury-eligible participants and a trial transcript based on an actual SVP proceeding, we systematically manipulated legal (standards of proof), victim (ages of previous victims), offender (number of previous convictions), and expert (expressed level of offender's future risk) testimony characteristics to determine which, if any, of these factors affected mock jurors' decisions. Results indicated that both the offender's number of prior convictions and expert testimony on the offender's level of future risk independently influenced jurors' commitment judgments. These findings raise the possibility that jurors may be double counting certain evidence, because previous convictions were explicitly contained in the risk assessment and provided as part of the expert's risk judgment. Differences in the standards of proof and ages of previous victims had no impact on jurors' verdicts. The legal and constitutional implications of jurors' insensitivity to changes in the proof threshold are discussed, as are the problems associated with jurors' placing independent weight on prior convictions in their decisions.

779,"Krysinska, K. and D. Lester (2016",,"This chapter reviews research on whether religiosity is a protective factor for suicidal ideation and behavior. The results of the research are mixed, with the evidence suggesting a protective effect from religiosity, except for psychotic patients. The results differ by age and sex, and the protective impact of religiosity is more apparent for attempted and completed suicide than for suicidal ideation. A study of college students indicated that scores on a measure of âReasons for Livingâ were stronger protective factors for suicidal ideation and attempts than was religiosity. Each year over 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide and, for each adult selfinflicted death, there are more than 20 suicide attempts (World Health Organization, 2014). In 2013 there were over 40,000 suicides in the US (13 per 100,000 per year), with 3.5 male deaths for each female death by suicide (Drapeau and McIntosh, 2015). The number of suicide attempts in US adults aged 18+ was estimated at 1.3 million, with 3 female attempts for every male attempt. In addition to the premature loss of life resulting from a death by suicide and the physical and emotional trauma of suicide attempters, suicide has a serious impact on people bereaved by suicide (âsuicide survivorsâ) and on the society as a whole. A research-based estimate indicates that a suicide on average intimately affects 25 other people, resulting in approximately one million new suicide loss survivors in the US every year (Drapeau and McIntosh, 2015). Suicidal ideation and behavior result from complex interactions among a wide range of risk and protective factors encompassing the entire life span of an individual (Lester, 2000). Although there are differences between age, gender and race/ethnic groups, factors related to an elevated risk for suicide include individual characteristics, such as mental health problems and psychiatric hospitalization, current suicidal ideation and previous suicidal behavior, physical illness, negative life events and low coping potential, as well as neurobiological and psychological factors, especially hopelessness. A family history of psychopathology and suicidal behavior and a lack of social support may also affect the. level of suicide risk. In addition, socioeconomic and cultural factors, such as a permissive attitude towards suicide and easy access to lethal means, can increase the risk. Sufficiently strong protective factors can outweigh the impact of risk factors. Although this area of study is still in its infancy, several factors which can reduce the risk of suicide have been identified. These include good physical health, hopefulness, strong reasons for living, effective problem-solving and coping skills, cognitive flexibility, having plans for the future, constructive use of leisure time, and the propensity to seek help. Availability of family and nonfamily social support, significant and stable relationships, children under the age of 18 living at home, employment, and restricted access to lethal means of suicide can reduce the risk of suicide. Socio-cultural factors, such as negative attitudes towards suicide and cultural continuity among the First Nations and other Indigenous peoples, have also been found to protect against suicidal ideation and behavior.

(2009",Family Functioning and Parental Divorce as Predictors of Attachment Styles and Sexual Attitudes in College Students.,"Research has demonstrated that parental divorce and family functioning are associated with children's socieomotional and psychological adjustment well into their adult years. Research has also demonstrated that sexual attitudes are becoming more liberal (cf., Harding & Jencks, 2003; Leiblum, Wiegel, & Brickle, 2003). The purpose of this research was to examine family functioning and parental divorce status in relation to attachment styles and sexual attitudes among college students ( n = 387). The participants completed the Brief Sexual Attitudes Scale (BSAS), The Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Scale (ECR-R), and Family Relationship Index (FRI). As hypothesized, family functioning was a better indicator than divorce status in explaining anxious and avoidant attachment scores. The hypothesis that family functioning would be a better predictor than divorce status in explaining permissive sexual attitudes was not supported. Furthermore, the hypothesis that higher scores on anxious and avoidant attachment scores would be predictive of more permissive sexual attitudes was supported with regard to avoidant attachment styles. Specifically, SPSS data analyses using multiple regressions found that college students who reported greater cohesiveness within their families (regardless of parental divorce status) reported lower anxious and lower avoidant attachment scores. Neither divorce status nor family functioning was predictive of permissive sexual attitudes. However, participants who reported greater avoidant attachment scores also reported endorsing more permissive sexual attitudes scores. Finally, males were more likely than females to endorse permissive sexual attitudes. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.

Some mothers described challenging and letting go of romantic illusions and adopting more realistic appraisals of their partners and relationships.

These six PSI scores were correlated with ""big five"" personality dimensions on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R); plus, scores on the Sexual-Racial Double-Standard Test (S-RD-ST) were regressed over the six PSI scores. A significant positive correlation between PSI ""guilt-ridden liberalism focused on the past"" and NEO PI-R neuroticism indicated that neuroticism is associated not with liberalism in general but with ""liberal guilt"". A significant negative correlation between PSI ""pragmatic conservatism focused on the present"" and NEO PI-R openness indicated that openness is not positively correlated with liberalism but is negatively correlated with one definition of conservatism. A significant positive correlation between PSI ""nostalgic conservatism focused on the past"" and NEO PI-R conscientiousness indicated that conscientiousness is associated not with conservatism in general but with one definition of conservatism. S-RD-ST-measured prejudice disfavoring African-American women and favoring white men was associated with PSI ""dread-ridden conservatism focused on the future,"" whereas prejudice favoring African-American women and disfavoring white men was associated with ""visionary liberalism focused on the future."" These findings show that surveying and scaling the PSI""s three psychotemporal definitions of liberalism and its three psychotemporal definitions of conservatism, instead of simply treating liberalism and conservatism as opposite ends of an ideological continuum, constitute a fruitful approach to understanding political ideologies and their relationship to other variables such as personality dimensions and racial biases.

Methods: We carried out a double-blind, parallel group study (n = 19/arm) with balanced randomization in blocks of 4 and stratification by sex. Subjects entered a 30-week trial, of which phases I-III were open: phase I (wk 0-6) baseline; phase II (wk 7-9) stepwise transition to haloperidol (HAL), 30 mg/d, plus benztropine (BT), 4 mg/d; phase III (wk 10-15) HAL, 40-60 mg/d, plus BT, 4-6 mg/d; phase IV (wk 16-20) stepwise transition to LMP or CPZ (500 mg/d) following randomization; phase V (wk 21-28) stepwise increase of LMP or CPZ (600-1000 mg/d, dose reduction permitted) to establish optimum dose; and phase VI (wk 29-30) optimized dose maintained. Criteria for TRS were based on those established by Kane et al in 1988. The criterion for a response to treatment was a reduction of 25% or more in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score. Results: Both LMP (p = 0.007) and CPZ (p = 0.030) improved TRS relative to baseline. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in treatment response at study end point, hierarchical linear modelling of longitudinal outcome revealed a significant (p = 0.006) advantage of LMP over CPZ for the BPRS total score. Ten of 19 participants on LMP and 8 of 19 on CPZ met the criterion for treatment response, and 9 of the 18 responders did so on 200-700 mg/d phenothiazine. The mean dose of responders was 710 (standard deviation [SD] 265) mg/d (LMP) and 722 (SD 272) mg/d (CPZ). Akathisia was associated with a nonresponse to phenothiazines (p = 0.010). BPRS scores increased significantly on HAL (p = 0.006). Two of 19 participants on LMP and 5 of 19 on CPZ withdrew early from the study. Conclusion: LMP and CPZ may be useful in the management of TRS. A modest advantage of LMP compared with CPZ was seen in longitudinal analysis. High doses of neuroleptics may contribute to TRS; reduction of neuroleptics to modest or moderate doses should be considered before categorizing a patient as treatment resistant.

Understanding attitude structure is important to achieving this goal. This study explores the intra-attitudinal structure of public censorship attitudes, specifically the general tendency to endorse particular government actions. For twenty-one scenarios, respondents indicated their agreement with each of five possible government reactions: prior restraint; subsequent punishment; time, place, manner restrictions; allow, and protect. Scale scores were computed for each government response. There are strong correlations between the two punitive restriction options and between the two permissive government responses. The time, place, manner response option related moderately to the other scales. Additional structural information is provided by examining scale relationships with other variables: gender, liberal-conservative self-rank, religiosity, need for cognition, authoritarianism, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion.

Ss submitted 550 questions, and results of content analysis identified 14 categories of responses. Questions concerning the strength of the female sex drive were asked the most frequently by 36.5% of the Ss. It is suggested that this category of questions reveals a process in the male's formation of a stable self-image by defining female sexuality as different from his own. Questions concerning how a male can sexually arouse a female were the 2nd most frequently asked by 10.4% of the Ss; questions about female emotions were also prevalent. It is posited that the adolescent male's attempt to cope with his own anxiety about sexuality leads to distorted notions about females and interferes with his understanding of the female psyche and female sexuality. It is concluded that Ss' questions evidenced double standards and sexist attitudes. The early perception of gender differences leads to different mental representations of self and object by both males and females.

Structural equation modeling, using longitudinal data from a sample of 612 African American adolescents (55% female), provided support for the model. The results indicated that parental religiosity influenced adolescent risky sexual behavior through its impact on authoritative parenting, adolescent religiosity, and adolescent affiliation with less sexually permissive peers. Some mediating mechanisms differed by the gender of the respondent, suggesting a ""double-standard"" for daughters but not for sons. Findings also indicated the importance of messages about sexual behavior that are transmitted to adolescents by their peers. Theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed.

790,"Lang, D. P. (2013","Circumcision, sexual dysfunction and the child's best interests: Why the anatomical details matter.","Comments on an article by Joseph Mazor (see record 2013-22200-004). Joseph Mazor makes a logical case, based on the premises underlying his reasoning, for his article's primary thesis: he concludes that parents have the prerogative to determine the 'best interests' of their infant son in a circumcision decision. If the facts of the matter were ultimately no different from what he adduces, one could admit the soundness of his argument. But the paper is flawed by some questionable assumptions and grievous incompleteness. First, the author insufficiently explores the profound implications of a serious equivocation in the term 'circumcision' that is common throughout the literature. Second, Mazor concedes that circumcision (periah) might cause a 'moderate' reduction of sexual pleasure in the lad's mature years, but he thinks this possibility is tolerably balanced by the alleged theoretical or statistical benefits that circumcision advocates often mention. Since this point seems in his mind to be the only real secular drawback for parental deliberation about adverse effects when determining the best interests of their son, this hinge contention demands refutation. Third, the author seems confused at the very outset of his essay about precisely what a violation of bodily integrity is, seeming to conflate it with any incision into bodily tissue. Fourth, beyond the subject of disturbed sexual functioning, the author seems not to take sufficiently seriously the potentially life-threatening risks associated with periah itself, which, though perhaps warranted in cases of utter medical necessity, are not at all vindicated as elective tradeoffs for some nebulous best interests of the boy as arbitrated by his parents, whether for secular or religious motives. Fifth, the sort of elective cost-benefit analysis exemplified in Mazor's table-weighing factors that may be deemed to be in line with, or contrary to, the best interests of a child-constitutes a sort of special pleading, curiously being applied only in the case of non-therapeutic male infant circumcision. Sixth, this leads inevitably to the problem of double standards and gender discrimination, which is supposedly outlawed in the liberal democracies of the Western-influenced world. Although Mazor anticipates this objection, his attempt to blunt its force fails. Specifically, while Mazor does not make it clear just what level of invasiveness of female genital cutting he thinks should be considered morally permissible in his theory, his own arguments, coupled with the relevant anatomical facts, would lead him to condone interventions much more damaging than a ritual 'nick' on a little girl's clitoris. Despite the distinctions throughout his paper between 'rights' and mere 'interests' that can be trumped by parental authority, Mazor cannot circumvent the hard reality of the integral role of the prepuce in normal sexual functioning.

This study investigated relationship satisfaction and attitudes toward infidelity as predictors of Facebook use, Facebook connection strategies, traditional infidelity, and Internet infidelity. Participants were adults 21 years of age or older in a monogamous heterosexual relationship for at least one year and Facebook users. The sample was obtained through the use of 10 recruiters from various demographic areas, of varying age, race, religion, and gender. Recruiters were given a script to post on their Facebook page with a link directing individuals to SurveyMonkey.com, a secure Internet data collection site. Participants provided informed consent and demographic information prior to completing the survey consisting of the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1989), Attitudes Toward Infidelity Scale (Whatley, 2006), a revised version of Whatley's (2006) Attitudes Toward Infidelity Scale, the Infidelity Scale (Drigotas et al., 1999), the Women, Sex, and the Internet (Wysocki & Childers, 2011) and additional questions concerning infidelity behaviors. Multiple regression analyses discovered relationship satisfaction was not a predictor of Facebook behaviors or infidelity; however, attitudes toward infidelity was a predictor of traditional and Internet infidelity and utilizing the Facebook connection strategy Maintaining Relationships. These findings suggest permissive attitudes toward infidelity impact participation in infidelity and using Facebook as a way to maintain preexisting relationship. Furthermore, 16.2% of participants reported infidelity, and 29.7% reported flirting electronically with someone other than their primary partner. Therefore, it is evident traditional infidelity and Internet infidelity is prevalent. Imperative to mention, this sample was 91% female and 94.6% Caucasian and cannot be generalized to other populations. Future research should investigate attitudes toward infidelity, Facebook use and connection strategies, and infidelity among other populations to obtain a more holistic understanding of attitudes toward infidelity, Facebook use and connection strategies, and infidelity.

Federal Statute 18 U.S.C. 4248 (2006) was originally enacted by Congress to establish guidelines for the civil commitment of federal prisoners or persons in federal custody who had been deemed ""sexually dangerous."" On the basis of this statute, a mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner can be indefinitely civilly committed to the custody of the Attorney General, beyond his release date, by a district court until he is deemed no longer dangerous or able to return to his home state for his care, custody, and treatment. The Supreme Court initially reviewed its rationale for granting certiorari for the case, stating that since the Fourth Circuit's decision in Comstock, two other courts of appeals had decided that 4248 was constitutional, thereby creating a split of authority among the circuit courts. The Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution grants Congress legislative power sufficient to enact 4248. This case carries particular importance, in that the Supreme Court has ruled on the issue of civil commitment for sex offenders who are currently in federal correctional confinement. Of note, the Court chose to rule on only a portion of the original respondents' claims, specifically Congress's enumerated powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

Data show that the youngest women were the most permissive, waiting the least time following marriage for a 1st liaison, although they still overwhelmingly believed in sexual fidelity. The group least concerned about sexual fidelity in marriage were those who had stayed married for over 10 yrs to the same spouse but who themselves had had at least 1 liaison. Those most concerned were women who had remarried following a divorce in which adultery had been relevant. Gender appeared to be more salient than age. The most marked changes were traced to the decade 1968-1978, when macrostructural and cultural events of greatest relevance to women occurred.

It is a regional geography course with a cultural emphasis. Five percent of the total instruction is devoted to the examination of women. This is justified because geographical concepts such as spatial interaction, environmental perception, and static distributions involve women's issues. Moreover, the role of women differs from one society to another, and the origins and distributions of role concepts are geographical. A brief section explains how house types and settlement morphology reveal cultural aspects about the position of women. The majority of the document compares status and roles of women in African, Arab, and American societies. Preschool sex roles of the three groups are similar, but learning of roles becomes more formalized when schooling begins. By puberty, great contrasts are found. Americans hold the sexual double standard; Arabs enforce female seclusion in order to prevent premarital sex and thereby ensure receipt of a woman's ""bride price;"" African tribes are less anxious about human sexuality and only few insist on virginity of unmarried women. Marriage patterns of polygyny or monogamy and effects of nuclear or extended families are also discussed. A short bibliography contains 17 references on women in Africa and the Arab world.

798,"Lee, N. Y. (2018",Un/forgettable histories of US camptown prostitution in South Korea: Women’s experiences of sexual labor and government policies.,"The military camptown in South Korea is a legacy of colonialism and a symbol of national insecurity in Korean history. From September 1945, when US troops arrived on the Korean peninsula for a transfer of power from the Japanese colonial empire, until the present day, the presence of American soldiers and military bases has been a familiar feature of Korean society. The purpose of this article is to trace the history of the US military camptown in Korea, adding the intersection of hidden stories of womenâs experiences. Based on an analysis of life stories of 14 former prostitutes and other primary and secondary sources, this article explores the ways in which the Korean government cooperated with US (military) interests in the systematic construction and maintenance of a system of camptown prostitution in the period from 1950 to 1980, with changes in policy from tacit permission to permissive promotion and then active support. During this process, women in camptowns experienced absurd, unjust and contradictory sociopolitical changes relating to international relations and national policies, as well as community attitudes toward and treatment of them in their vulnerable state. However, these women were neither absolute sexual objects nor helpless victims. Women in camptowns managed to carve out spaces for themselves and change their material conditions, cultural identities, and even their legal status, demonstrating their struggle for survival. In this way, women in camptowns represent a symbol of transgression against both androcentric Korean society and ethnocentric nationalism. Â© The Author(s) 2017.",0,798

Two hundred and five college students (61% female, mean age = 20.5) completed surveys about the frequency and quality of their sex-related conversations with same-sex best friends, and their sexual attitudes and behaviors. These conversations were more frequent between females, and between less religious youth. Sexually active youth discussed most topics more frequently than abstinent youth, although abstinent youth discussed abstinence more frequently. More frequent and comfortable conversations were generally associated with more liberal sexual attitudes, and more positive condom-related attitudes. Differential associations between the specific topics discussed and attitudes about sexuality, HIV, and condoms highlight the importance of examining multiple dimensions of sex-related communication rather than the unidimensional measures typically employed.

Specifically, this study examined sex differences in reasons for beginning such involvements, commitment to the friendship versus sexual aspects of the relationship, and partners' anticipated hopes for the future. To do so, an Internet sample of individuals currently involved in FWB relationships was recruited. Results indicated many overall similarities in terms of how the sexes approach FWB relationships, but several important differences emerged. For example, sex was a more common motivation for men to begin such relationships, whereas emotional connection was a more common motivation for women. In addition, men were more likely to hope that the relationship stays the same over time, whereas women expressed more desire for change into either a full-fledged romance or a basic friendship. Unexpectedly, both men and women were more committed to the friendship than to the sexual aspect of the relationship. Although some additional similarities appeared, the findings were largely consistent with the notion that traditional gender role expectations and the sexual double standard may influence how men and women approach FWB relationships.

801,"Lennox, J., et al. (2018",The role of alcohol in constructing gender & class identities among young women in the age of social media.,"Research suggests young women view drinking as a pleasurable aspect of their social lives but that they face challenges in engaging in a traditionally 'masculine' behaviour whilst maintaining a desirable 'femininity'. Social network sites such as Facebook make socialising visible to a wide audience. This paper explores how young people discuss young women's drinking practices, and how young women construct their identities through alcohol consumption and its display on social media. We conducted 21 friendship-based focus groups (both mixed and single sex) with young adults aged 18-29 years and 13 individual interviews with a subset of focus group respondents centred on their Facebook practices. We recruited a purposive sample in Glasgow, Scotland (UK) which included 'middle class' (defined as students and those in professional jobs) and 'working class' respondents (employed in manual/service sector jobs), who participated in a range of venues in the night time economy. Young women's discussions revealed a difficult 'balancing act' between demonstrating an 'up for it' sexy (but not too sexy) femininity through their drinking and appearance, while still retaining control and respectability. This 'balancing act' was particularly precarious for working class women, who appeared to be judged more harshly than middle class women both online and offline. While a gendered double standard around appearance and alcohol consumption is not new, a wider online audience can now observe and comment on how women look and behave. Social structures such as gender and social class remain central to the construction of identity both online and offline. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,801
802,"Leonard, S. (2010",True Love,"Elizabeth Taylor's invocation of the reality of her romantic relation with the actor Richard Burton, as well as her and Burton's repeated public declarations that they would die without the other, helped to secure for the pair permanent placement in the annals of Hollywood's most celebrated loves. In 1996, People magazine featured Taylor and Burton in their special double issue, ""The Greatest Love Stories of the Century,"" and claimed, ""through two marriages and 23 years, the lustiest of couples couldn't live with - or without - each other.""1 Such language evidences the degree to which Taylor and Burton's romance, which began as an adulterous affair on the set of Cleopatra in 1962, continued to be accorded epic status even some forty-odd years after its inception. That this relationship remains recognizable and even idolized in the twenty-first century might be attributed to its having so closely approximated itself to a script recognizable as that of a once-in-a-lifetime romance - the Burtons were described as utterly dependent on one another and passionately in love, even after years of marriage. Moreover, the pair had a penchant for showcasing their celebrated romance in the multiple films they made together, and especially for accepting roles so nearly aligned with their star persona that they were often considered to be playing themselves on screen.2 In addition to having repeatedly appeared on screen as a couple, Taylor and Burton were a consistent feature in the tabloid press. Gossip magazines charted the pair's every emotional upheaval and pursued the couple with such zeal that their spats literally made international headlines. Not ones to reject this constant commodification, Taylor and Burton also seemed eager to stage the spectacle of their relationship for the press, their public, and even each other - the pair made a habit out of discussing and performing their notorious bouts, seemingly as much for the edification of their followers as for their own pleasure. Taylor and Burton thus consistently appeared both on screen and in their personal lives to be performing, and quite convincingly at that, the role of great lovers. Borrowing from a postmodern logic, we might say that Taylor and Burton's love was created through the act of incessantly citing that love on screen and in star discourse, rather than existing in any way outside the realm of performativity. Indeed, it is the argument of this article that the films in which Taylor and Burton appear together as well as the hyperbolic discourses that surrounded them in the form of advertisements, gossip columns, publicity materials, and magazine articles were constitutive of their ""true love."" Specifically, this investigation will call on the tenets of star studies, postmodernism, and the burgeoning field of sexuality studies in order to unpack the mechanisms of the couple's image construction, in an effort to illustrate their romance's discursivity. At the same time, the project has within its purview the larger aim of demystifying the heterosexual contract. The cultural theorists Lauren Berlant and Michael Warner have usefully defined the term ""heteronormativity"" to describe how scenes of intimacy, coupling, and kinship become associated with the forms and arrangements of social life. As they argue, in American culture ""a whole field of social relations becomes intelligible as heterosexuality, and this privatized sexual culture bestows on its sexual practices a sense of rightness and normalcy. ""3 Star discourses, I argue, participate in this process because they reify certain notions of heteronormativity, notions that are in turn codified across a wide social spectrum. While feminism has consistently been critical of the process of romantic mystification and also heterosexual marriage (at the risk, at times, of accusing women of false consciousness), the more recent theoretical tendency to think about the interrelationship between constructions of romance and the heterosexual imperative unveils the power of heterosexuality to delimit acceptable parameter for sexual behavior, divisions of labor, patterns of economic interest, regulations of space, and everyday practices. Unpacking the so-called true love of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, as I will do here, represents a wider attempt to continue a feminist legacy that has always interrogated romance and marriage, while at the same time it brings contemporary models of heteronormativity to bear on the construction of a couple whose behaviors set the standard for staging romance, associating it with a strict set of ideological, aesthetic, and emotional parameters. The Burtons are a particularly fascinating case study in this regard because in high postmodern fashion, their star image worked at cross purposes. That is, at the same time that the couple appeared as a paragon of classical romance, the discourses surrounding them betrayed the highly unnatural and often irrational machinations required to create the appearance of an identity that was supposedly authentic. As this article will quantify, Taylor and Burton's star image adhered to an inverse formula whereby the more excessively unrealistic the couple's performances became, the more strongly did their relation guarantee its status as an iconic love.

Left largely absent from the discourse has been the experiences of male victims of IPV, both gay and heterosexual. The present study examined the lived experience and relationship history of male victims of IPV using a qualitative format, utilizing semi-structured interview questions, the Thematic Apperception Test, and the Relationship Scales Questionnaire to extrapolate information regarding similarities and differences among participants. Four major categories, the nature of IPV, the role of the family of origin, the influence of gender, and assertion of power and control, were delineated, along with 10 themes, six sub-themes, and five significant additional findings. Major themes, those endorsed by the most participants, included the following: abuse and violence perpetrated against men come in many forms; damaging impact of a history of divorce, dysfunction, and abuse in the family, poor relationships among participants and their parents; negative impact of relationship between violent intimate partner and their family of origin; dysfunctional first significant intimate relationships; negative impact of the failure to model successful relationships in the family of origin; injustice, gender symmetry, and the double standard contribute to the victimization of men; pursuing protection depended on gender; fostering isolation was a powerful means of controlling and exerting power over victims; manipulation was used to control victims. The findings are congruent with the limited literature on this topic, and the results of this study contribute to the literature by providing clinicians with more information regarding the mechanism by which men become victims of IPV so that clinicians can better tailor therapeutic interventions to address the needs of male victims.

The first two studies looked at children's ratings of videotaped male and female adults shown interacting with a child. The next two studies assessed the roles of other examiner and child variables on children's gender-typing. Each study involved equal numbers of boys and girls ranging in age from about 8 to 11 years. The results indicated that children's gender-typing is influenced by a number of variables, including the sex of the person interviewing them. These studies indicated that factors influencing the behaviors and memories of boys and girls included whether children: (1) had a male or female examiner; (2) expressed high or low amounts of gender-role flexibility; (3) perceived their parents as gender-role permissive or not; and (4) were familiar, or perhaps at ease, with an examiner of a particular sex. The results call into question findings from studies where examiners were of only one sex (typically female) or examiner's and children's sexes were not adequately counterbalanced.

(2001",Psychotherapy and spirituality: A paradigm for healing.,"Lewis' exploratory study incorporates data from a case study of a profoundly depressed woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder to show how she is healed through a psychotherapeutic and spiritual journey into her unconscious mind. The study vividly details the counseling experiences that uncovered repressed memories of sexual and Satanic Ritual Abuse, the core of this depression. Extensive first-person narrative is used to illustrate how the woman was able to overcome the physical and emotional revivifications of her trauma. The study explores the use of two relatively new techniques in spiritual counseling: the TheoPhostic method (Smith 1996), which enables client and therapist to work together with God to reintegrate dissociated ""parts"" on a spiritual level; and Time Line Therapy (James and Woodsmall 1988), a method for the visualization of personal time and memory recall involving color, lack of color, and light. Both methods are proposed as particularly effective in knowing about repressed and dissociated trauma memories and in healing these severe traumas as caused by sexual and Satanic Ritual Abuse. Various standard counseling techniques of reframing, changing history, discovering core beliefs, changing core beliefs and discovering disowned parts of self are all demonstrated in this work. The not so standard techniques used in this work involve the therapist and the client's reports of finding external and internal spiritual guides along with a beautiful white light that provided extraordinary resources in stopping the client's profound and sometimes life threatening abreactions. The most significant and powerful technique visualizing Divine Light shining on and penetrating each newly conscious traumatized ""part"" proved to be truly miraculous for the client. Using a double column format, the client's narrative is contextualized in terms of both traditional (Janet, Charcot, Freud, Jung, Adler) and contemporary (van der Kolk, Kluft, Putnam, Herman, Terr, LeDoux, James and Smith) researchers. The contextualized material puts the client's behaviors and feelings into a scholarly format that therapists and students will find enriching and educational.

A particular focus on the analyses were possible gender differences. MDMA in oral doses ranging from 70-150 mg was administered under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions.

Physiological measures were BP, heart rate, and peripheral body temperature. Psychoactive effects of MDMA were more intense in women, with women having especially higher scores for induced perceptual changes, thought disturbances, and fear of loss of body control. The MDMA dose positively correlated with the intensity of perceptual changes in women. Acute adverse effects were also more frequent in females than in males.

A prompt diagnosis is crucial, but these patients must be distinguished from patients with non-haemorrhagic benign thunderclap headache (BTH). The headache characteristics and associated features at onset in subarachnoid haemorrhage and benign thunderclap headache were studied to delineate the range of early features in these conditions. In this prospective study, one of two observers interviewed 102 patients with acute severe headache by means of a standard questionnaire. The patients were alert on admission and had no focal deficits. ASAH was subsequently diagnosed in 42 patients, non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic haemorrhage (PMH) in 23 patients, and BTH in 37 patients. Headache developed almost instantaneously in 50% of patients with ASAH, 35% of patients with PMH, and 68% of patients with BTH and within 1 to 5 minutes in 19%, 35%, and 19%, respectively. Loss of consciousness was reported in 26% of patients with ASAH, 4% of patients with PMH and 16% of patients with BTH, and transient focal symptoms in 33%, 9%, and 22% respectively.

Vomiting and physical exertion preceding the onset of headache were more frequent in patients with ASAH (69% and 50%) and those with PMH (83% and 39%) than in those with BTH (43% and 22%). Headache developed almost instantaneously in only half the patients with aneurysmal rupture and in two thirds of patients with benign thunderclap headache. In patients with acute severe headache, female sex, the presence of seizures, a history of loss of consciousness or focal symptoms, vomiting, or exertion increases the probability of ASAH, but these characteristics are of limited value in distinguishing ASAH from BTH.

(1995",Objectivity and the double standard for feminist epistemologies.,"The emphasis on the limitations of objectivity, in specific guises and networks, has been a continuing theme of contemporary analytic philosophy for the past few decades. The popular sport of baiting feminist philosophers - into pointing to what's left out of objective knowledge, or into describing what methods, exactly, they would offer to replace the powerful ""objective"" methods grounding scientific knowledge - embodies a blatant double standard which has the effect of constantly putting feminist epistemologists on the defensive, on the fringes, on the run. This strategy can only work if 'objectivity' is transparent, simple, stable, and clear in its meaning. It most certainly is not. In fact, taking 'objectivity' as a sort of beautiful primitive, self-evident in its value, and all-powerful in its revelatory power, requires careless philosophy, and the best workers in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science have made reworked definitions of 'objectivity' absolutely central to their own projects. In fact, classic feminist concerns with exploring the impact of sex and gender on knowledge, understanding, and other relations between human beings and the rest of the world fall squarely within the sort of human and social settings that are already considered central in most current analytic metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science. I argue that the burden of proof is clearly on those who wish to reject the centrality and relevance of sex and gender to our most fundamental philosophical work on knowledge and reality.

More importantly, our study found that more collectivistic individuals, especially people with high vertical collectivism, were less likely to accept premarital and extramarital sex and engage in sexually permissive behavior. People with the highest individualistic orientation, namely, vertical individualism, were most likely to accept Internet pornography, premarital sex, and sexually permissive behavior. The findings indicate that an egalitarian orientation of people, including those with horizontal individualism, horizontal collectivism, and vertical collectivism, are more likely to abide by social norms and conform to community standard against deviance. On the other hand, people with highly individualistic and hierarchical orientation are more likely to accept social deviance which matches the desire of highly individualistic people to be distinct and unique.

819,"Lou, C., et al. (2012","Media's contribution to sexual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors for adolescents and young adults in three Asian cities.","Purpose: Evidence in western countries indicates that the media have associations with adolescents' and young people's sexual behavior that may be as important as family, school, and peers. In this new study of Asian adolescents and young adults in the three cities of Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei, the associations between exposure to sexual content in the media and adolescents' and young adults' sex-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors are explored in societies with traditional Confucian culture, but at different stages in the process of modernization. Methods: The data are from a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted from 2006 to 2007, where a sample of 17,016 adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years from Shanghai, Hanoi, and Taipei completed face-to-face interviews coupled with computer-assisted self-interviews for sensitive questions. For the objectives of this article, analysis was restricted to the 16,554 unmarried respondents. Exposure to sexual content in the mass media (including the Internet and traditional media), pornographic videos, and a preference for western/Asian movies/videos were the main media influence measures. Sex-related knowledge, premarital sexual permissiveness (PSP), and sex-related behaviors were the main outcome measures. The impact of each of four contexts including family, peer, school, and media on sex-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were assessed using multiple linear regression stratified by gender and city, controlling for age, urban/rural residence, education, and economic status. The change in adjusted R2 from the multiple linear regression analysis was adopted to indicate the contribution of family, peer, school, and media variables to respondents' sex-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Results: The contextual factors, including family, peer, school, and media, explained 30%-50% of the variance in sex-related knowledge, 8%-22% of the variance in PSP, and 32%-41% of the variance in sex-related behaviors. Media variables explained 13%-24% of the variance in sexual knowledge, 3%-13% in PSP, and 3%-13% in sex-related behaviors, which was comparable with that of family, peer, and school variables. These associations differed by city and gender. Conclusions: Access to and use of mass media and the messages they present are influential factors on sex-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of unmarried Asian adolescents and young adults, and should be considered in future research and intervention programs attempting to improve reproductive health outcomes.

820,"Lowenstein, A. (2011",,"A History of Violence directly precedes Eastern Promises and demands contemplation alongside it. Based loosely on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke adapted for the screen by Josh Olson, A History of Violence distills Cronenberg's most powerful themes and applies them, rather uncharacteristically, to an explicitly American context (as a Canadian director, Cronenberg tends to favor explicitly Canadian or vaguely defined ""North American"" settings for his films-even so, the locales of Millbrook, Indiana, and Philadelphia in A History of Violence were shot in Ontario).7 Eastern Promises extends the history of violence to London, Russia, Afghanistan, Chechnya, and elsewhere, but it, too, inevitably, addresses the United States' role in contemporary geopolitics. Eastern Promises insists that when Americanization both gives birth to and gives way to globalization, intertwined histories of violence become the global condition. If 9/11 and the Iraq War inform A History of Violence, as I will contend below, then the collapse of the Soviet Union informs Eastern Promises. What the two films accomplish as one conjoined work stems from how Cronenberg interweaves these two watershed geopolitical events to foster critical reflection on globalization. In both films, this work of reflection depends on the use of gestures first employed in Cronenberg's earliest horror films. Gesture, as a mode of speaking with the body rather than with words, has always played a vital role in film art. For the philosopher Giorgio Agamben (extending the work of Gilles Deleuze), gesture constitutes not only the bedrock of cinematic expression but also the means by which cinema becomes political. Cinema rests on an ""antinomic polarity"" between images, which freeze gestural movements, and gestures, which preserve the dynamism of these movements. According to Agamben, ""the former lives in magical isolation,"" while ""the latter always refers beyond itself to a whole of which it is a part."" Cinema's fundamental investment in the gesture, rather than the image, indicates how film ""belongs essentially to the realm of ethics and politics (and not simply to that of aesthetics)."" Why is this so? For Agamben, ""What characterizes gesture is that in it nothing is being produced or acted, but rather something is being endured and supported. The gesture, in other words, opens the sphere of ethos as the more proper sphere of that which is human."" Gestures, then, have political and ethical value in that they break with ""the false alternative between ends and means that paralyzes morality."" The ""mediality"" of gestures-their preservation of movement that endures and supports (means) instead of subjugating means to the finality of goals that produce and act (ends)-allows them to convey means and ends as a single, ongoing process. The result is that cinema, with the gesture as its core expres sion, invites spectators to perceive actions as a fluidity encompassing means and ends-""a pure and endless mediality"" where ethical decisions present themselves at every juncture, not just the endpoint captured in the frozen image. Agamben concludes that ""cinema leads images back to the homeland of gesture,"" but that ""the duty of the director"" (a political duty) resides with how that director's film will provoke ""the liberation of the image into gesture."" 8 To understand how Cronenberg fulfills this duty, one must trace the post- 9/11 gestures of A History of Violence and Eastern Promises through those of Shivers and The Brood. In the wake of 9/11, a transformation of a different kind occurs in Cronenberg's work. With his remarkable, intimately linked films A History of Violence (2005) and Eastern Promises (2007), Cronenberg moves toward integrating the two halves of his career. One must add the caveat, however, that to divide his career into ""halves"" in the first place is not entirely accurate, since the art cinema proclivities were always there in the ""horror films,"" and the horror tendencies remain present in the ""art films."" Yet the ability of A History of Violence and Eastern Promises to meld the sensational shocks of his early efforts with the art cinema trappings that characterize his later work, such as the presence of internationally renowned stars and controversial sexual themes, signals something new for Cronenberg. This essay analyzes these two films in terms of how the haunting echoes of 9/11 and the subsequent U.S. ""War on Terror"" in Afghanistan and Iraq figure in transforming horror genre vocabulary into provocations concerning globalized geopolitics in Cronenberg's cinema. These transformations in Cronenberg's films take on particular importance in the post- 9/11 cinematic landscape, where many explicit representations of the War on Terror fail to reach a substantial audience (e.g., most Iraq War films prior to The Hurt Locker [Kathryn Bigelow, 2008], and even that Academy Award winner was more of a critics' darling than a sweeping popular success), and many implicit representations face critical dismissal through unfortunate labels such as ""torture porn"" (see the critical reception of Hostel [Eli Roth, 2005] and its contemporary horror film brethren).4 Cronenberg's post- 9/11 films offer valuable opportunities for political engagement with the War on Terror by interweaving popular accessibility, critical admiration, and the confrontational aesthetics honed over more than three decades spent straddling the horror film and art cinema. Eastern Promises transpires amid the sound and fury of clashing cultures in today's London. The film begins by introducing three bloodied bodies in succession: Soyka (Aleksander Mikic), a captain in the Russian organized crime syndicate vory v zakone, has his throat slit in a barbershop belonging to a Turkish immigrant; Tatiana (Sarah Jeanne Labrosse), a pregnant, fourteen- yearold Russian prostitute, bleeds between her legs and faints while asking for help from an Indian pharmacist; and Tatiana's daughter, born as her mother dies in Trafalgar Hospital, emerges tiny and helpless, awash in her mother's blood. The visual image of blood that binds these three scenes, which indicates a continuity between these three bodies, reasserts itself in the film's dialogue shortly afterward. Anna (Naomi Watts), the nurse supervising the birth of Tatiana's daughter, comes home from the hospital and presents Tatiana's diary to her own uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski). Although Anna's deceased father was Russian, her mother is English and she cannot read Russian herself; she hopes her Russian uncle will translate the diary for her. Stepan refuses, however, accusing Anna of robbing the dead. He insists that the diary should be buried with Tatiana's ""bodies."" Anna corrects Stepan's English, reminding him that he means the singular ""body,"" not the plural ""bodies."" He shrugs off her comment, a gesture that suggests she misses the point viewers already understand: blood connects each body to a series of bodies. By the same logic, Stepan's apparent infelicity with the English language, his inability to master it as an immigrant, points toward another language the audience must learn during the film-neither Russian nor English, both Russian and English-the language, in other words, spoken by Cronenberg's cinema. When Eastern Promises redefines an apparently singular body by showing us the plural bodies that lend it meaning-and writes that redefinition on the body, in blood-it constitutes the latest iteration of Cronenberg's longstanding cinematic project. This project's roots in horror will be recognizable to anyone observing Cronenberg's career since he reframed the intellectual concerns of his experimental mini- features Stereo (1969) and Crimes of the Future (1970) to enter the commercial arena with Shivers. Whether we think of the phallic/fecal- looking parasites that induce sexual dementia in Shivers, or the radical psychotherapy that enables emotions of rage to be ""born"" as murderous children in The Brood (1979), or the matter transmitter that fuses human and housefly at the molecular- genetic level in The Fly, Cronenberg's horror confronts us with bodies that revolt. These are revolting bodies in a double sense: they rebel against their conventional identities and functions within the films, but they also prove difficult for us to watch. Given the confrontational nature of Cronenberg's cinematic project, it makes a certain amount of practical as well as poetic sense that his films would appeal to their widest audience in many years during the turbulent times dominated by the Iraq War, in the still- unfolding wake of 9/11. In this moment, Cronenberg turns his attention more specifically than ever before to the conjuncture of violence and globalized geopolitics. According to the cultural anthropologist Arjun Appadurai, the key to defining what makes globalization ""strikingly new"" over the past century or so is ""a technological explosion, largely in the domain of transportation and information, that makes the interactions of a print- dominated world seem as hard- won and as easily erased as the print revolution made earlier forms of cultural traffic appear.""5 For Appadurai, the centrality of media such as cinema, television, and computers to the new global cultural economy demands that we shift our understanding of globalization from standard centerperiphery models, where concepts such as Americanization have explained how the center dominates the periphery, to a more ""disjunctive"" point of view. In disjunctive globalization, global flows move in multiple, uneven, and idiosyncratic directions simultaneously, not just from the center to the periphery. ""The complexity of the current global economy,"" concludes Appadurai, ""has to do with certain fundamental disjunctures between economy, culture, and politics that we have only begun to theorize.""6 The events of 9/11 could be seen as inaugurating a heightened awareness of a particular form of disjunctive globalization, one where global flows operate according to the speed of digital media and the visual logic of spectacular violence. After 9/11, in other words, disjunctive globalization looks more than ever before ""just like a movie""-a phrase used again and again to describe the awful carnage of that day. Cronenberg's post- 9/11 films go to the political heart of this violent, cinematized sense of globalization. The resulting illumination of how violence circulates in a global era where we are shown so much but see so little represents a crucial political turn for Cronenberg. Analyzing this turn invites consideration of how Cronenberg's presentation of violence, with its connections to his earlier horror films, shapes the way these new films imagine globalized geopolitics after 9/11. From Shivers (1975) through The Fly (1986), the cinema of director David Cronenberg repeatedly depicted the human body thrust to such violent extremes of physical transformation that he earned nicknames like the ""Baron of Blood"" among horror fans.1 Cronenberg's films remained equally disturbing from Dead Ringers (1988) through Spider (2002), but they tended to channel the notion of transformation in less visceral ways.2 The result was a series of more critically acclaimed films closer in tone and reception to art cinema than the horror genre.3 Copyright Â© 2011 by the University of Texas Press All rights reserved.",0,820
821,"Ludden, T. (2004",Allegories of cultural relations: An examination of Anne Duden's mode of reading representations of St George and the Dragon.,"This essay examines Anne Duden's literary-philosophical text 'Gegenstrebige FÃ¼gung' in the light of Frankfurt School and feminist theories. It argues that Duden blurs the distinction between legend and myth in her writing about Vittore Carpaccio's paintings of St George and the Dragon to read the representation of the battle between man and dragon as illustrative of founding myths of Western Enlightenment culture. These include the emancipation of reason from nature, the belief in progress, and the privileging of mind and the autonomous subject over the object and matter. The essay examines Duden's mode of reading representations of the myth of the victory of good over evil as a disingenuous narrative which covers up what such representations actually produce: a discourse about normality and abnormality and about the types of selves, bodies and values which are privileged by Western culture. Duden's reading de-mystifies traditional ways of interpreting St George's story in line with recent poststructuralist theory. However, rather than standard psychoanalytic readings of the story in which the dragon represents sexuality and femininity which needs to be repressed, I analyse Duden's more radical 'Kulturkritik' through her evocation of mechanisms of exclusion and the creation of binary oppositions as a prerequisite for the survival of culture and its myths and as a necessity for a repetition of culture's dominant narratives. The double sight that art allows, however, means that it functions in Duden's readings as a privileged realm where the forgotten and excluded may be remembered. Thus a reading against the grain becomes possible, activating alternative meanings. Â© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2004.",0,821

The magazine smajor contributions to female emancipation lay in the realm of sexuality: its recognition of the econom ic imperative in female sexuality, a critique of marriage, a cry against sexual double standards, a protest against oppressive moral codes, a challenge to patriarchy, the celebration of sexuality, and the demandfor birth control. Paradoxically, on other key women s issues such as suffrage or employment, the magazine pursued an anti-feminist agenda. The biggest paradox was that Goldmanâs idealization of motherhood and essentialist claims about female biology, compounded by the anarchistsâ antipathy toward the government and corporate world, made the magazine a vehicle for perpetuating restrictive gender stereotypes and stymied Mother Earth from supporting female forays into the public sphere.

Relative to saline perfusion, digestible fat, but not sucrose polyester, decreased prospective feeding intentions, increased a feeling of fullness and reduced hunger feelings in women (N = 9) but not in men (N = 9). Sucrose polyester tended to suppress appetite ratings less effectively than digestible fat in women. Food intake did not vary among fat, sucrose polyester and saline. Cholecystokinin and pancreatic polypeptide concentrations increased over basal value and in men as in women during perfusion of digestible fat, but not during perfusion of sucrose polyester or saline.

Aim: To review the etiology, pathogenesis diagnosis, and the available treatments for DP in males. Methods: A systematic search of published evidence was performed using Medline (1969 to September 2011). Main Outcome Measures: The most important evidence regarding DP and the available treatment options were reviewed and discussed. Whenever possible, levels of evidence are reported. Results: The prevalence of DP in 14-year-old boys in the United States is less than 2%, almost double of same figure in females. The etiology of DP is complex including genetic, functional, or nonidentifiable defects. The correct diagnosis should include an accurate medical history and physical examination along with specific laboratory tests. In addition, bone age radiographs are frequently helpful. If a specific disorder can be identified, therapy should be targeted at that disorder. Short-term testosterone therapy can be offered to boys with constitutional DP after a variable time of expectant observation essentially dictated by the patient's distress. Reassurance and continued observation, to ensure that the expected sexual maturation occurs, are often sufficient. In all other cases, exogenous gonadotropins, either recombinant or extracted, induce full gonadal maturation, while long-term testosterone therapy is the treatment of choice for hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or for hypothalamic or pituitary gonadotropin deficiency until fertility is attained. Conclusions: DP is a frequent condition that if not correctly diagnosed, may cause serious clinical and psychological consequences. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment provide normal pubertal development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,830

Objective: To determine the effect of meeting the estimated DHA requirement of preterm infants on neurodevelopment at 18 months' corrected age. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind controlled trial enrolling infants born at less than 33 weeks' gestation from April 2001 to October 2005 at 5 Australian tertiary hospitals, with follow-up to 18 months. Intervention: High-DHA (approximately 1% total fatty acids) enteral feeds compared with standard DHA (approximately 0.3% total fatty acids) from day 2 to 4 of life until term corrected age. Main Outcome Measures: Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) at 18 months' corrected age. A priori subgroup analyses were conducted based on randomization strata (sex and birth weight <1250 g vs >=1250 g). Results: Of the 657 infants enrolled, 93.5% completed the 18-month follow-up. Bayley MDI scores did not differ between the high- and standard-DHA groups (mean difference, 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0 to 4.7). The MDI among girls fed the high-DHA diet was higher than girls fed standard DHA in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (unadjusted mean difference, 4.7; 95% CI, 0.5-8.8; adjusted mean difference, 4.5; 95% CI, 0.5-8.5). The MDI among boys did not differ between groups. For infants born weighing less than 1250 g, the MDI in the high-DHA group was higher than with standard DHA in the unadjusted comparison (mean difference, 4.7; 95% CI, 0.2-9.2) but did not reach statistical significance following adjustment for gestational age, sex, maternal education, and birth order (mean difference, 3.8; 95% CI, -0.5 to 8.0). The MDI among infants born weighing at least 1250 g did not differ between groups. Conclusion: A DHA dose of approximately 1% total fatty acids in early life did not increase MDI scores of preterm infants overall born earlier than 33 weeks but did improve the MDI scores of girls.

Subjects with inadequate response were randomized to adjunctive placebo (n = 190) or adjunctive aripiprazole (n = 191) (starting dose 5 mg/d, dose adjustments 2-20 mg/d, mean end-point dose of 11.0 mg/d). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score from end of prospective treatment phase to end of randomized treatment phase (last observation carried forward). Mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score was significantly greater with adjunctive aripiprazole than placebo (-8.5 vs -5.7; P = 0.001). Remission rates were significantly greater with adjunctive aripiprazole than placebo (25.4% vs 15.2%; P = 0.016) as were response rates (32.4% vs 17.4%; P < 0.001). Adverse events occurring in 10% of patients or more with adjunctive placebo or aripiprazole were akathisia (4.2% vs 25.9%), headache (10.5% vs 9.0%), and fatigue (3.7% vs 10.1%). Incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation was low (adjunctive placebo [1.1%] vs adjunctive aripiprazole [3.7%]). Aripiprazole is an effective and safe adjunctive therapy as demonstrated in this short-term study for patients who are nonresponsive to standard ADT.

837,"Margolis, H., et al. (1978",Conceptual tempo as a predictor of first-grade reading achievement.,"Investigated the effects of kindergarten conceptual tempo classification on middle of 1st-grade reading performance of 92 children. The results obtained using the traditional Matching Familiar Figures (MFF) Test double median split classification procedure were compared with results obtained by computing a linear score for each S that combined the MFF standard scores for latency and errors. Regardless of the classification procedure, conceptual tempo did not significantly influence reading achievement. When equated for kindergarten reading readiness scores, significant vocabulary and comprehension differences were not found for tempo, sex, or interaction. It is concluded that the conceptual tempo of kindergartners does not appear of utility in predicting their middle of 1st-grade reading performance.

LeBaron (2004",Attitudes toward cervical cancer screening among muslim women: A pilot study.,"Background: Immigrant Muslim women have low rates of health care utilization, especially preventive care such as breast exams, mammograms, and cervical cancer screening. Religious and cultural beliefs, such as the value placed on modesty and premarital virginity, contribute to reluctance to seek health care. In addition, it has been unclear whether discussions of health care behavior that involve sexuality and reproductive health would be welcomed among immigrant Muslim women. Purposes: (1) To examine the impact of religious and cultural values on health care behavior of Muslim women from immigrant backgrounds in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly with regard to cervical cancer screening; (2) To determine whether these women would welcome discussing values and beliefs regarding sexuality and reproductive health. Methods: Our key informants were five Muslim women who identified pelvic and Pap smear screening exams as major sources of anxiety for their community, and therefore major barriers to health care. Three focus groups were then convened, including 15 women ages 18-25, to discuss these issues in more detail. Results: Many Muslim women from immigrant backgrounds face challenges in obtaining adequate health care due to some common barriers of language, transportation, insurance, and family pressures. Additionally, many Muslim women resist screening practices that are the standard in the US but which threaten their cultural and religious values. Equally important, many health care professionals contribute to the women's challenges by making inappropriate recommendations regarding physical exams and reproductive health. The women were enthusiastic and candid in discussing these highly sensitive and taboo topics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,838

Several hypotheses were formulated to address the research problem including: (1) Based on the research, which indicates societal tendencies toward favoring marriage and family life, it was hypothesized that 51% or more of the adolescents surveyed would express positive attitudes toward marriage and family life. (2) Based on the research suggesting today's young people have been exposed to divorce more than other similar age groups and their attitudes have been affected by high divorce rates, it was hypothesized that 51% or less of the adolescents surveyed would express negative attitudes about divorce. (3) Based on the research, which suggests society has grown more accepting of alternatives to marriage, it was hypothesized that 51% or more of the adolescents surveyed would express positive attitudes toward cohabitation. (4) Based on the research, which suggests that there has been an increase in premarital sexual behaviors, it is hypothesized that 51% or more of the adolescents surveyed would express accepting attitudes about premarital sex. (5) Based on the research which suggests most individuals do not believe that premarital counseling and psycho-educational interventions are needed, it was hypothesized that 51% or more of the respondents surveyed would express negative attitudes toward seeking premarital counseling and psycho-educational interventions. The data was examined in several ways, incorporating frequencies, percentages, means, medians, and standard deviations. Based on this analysis of the data, the following results were found. (1) The majority of respondents were juniors and seniors in high school between the ages of 17 and 18, predominately female, Caucasian, who lived with married parents. (2) Adolescents from this investigation support marriage and view it as a lifelong commitment. (3) The majority of adolescents did not express negative attitudes about divorce. (4) The majority of adolescents expressed ambivalent. attitudes about premarital sex. However, a majority of adolescents indicated they would or have engaged in sexual intercourse before marriage. (5) Although the majority of respondents did not support cohabitation it was indicated that there is a growing acceptance for this lifestyle as a method of preparation for marriage. A high incidence of respondents indicated they supported living with someone they before they married him or her. (6) Adolescent respondents demonstrated a growing acceptance for premarital counseling and psycho-educational interventions. Results from this study have implications for psychologists, counselors and educators who work with adolescents. Utilizing this information to help adolescents understand marriage and family life is important. The development of premarital preparation programs, workshops, and psycho-educational interventions to be used in schools, churches, and youth centers are critical if psychologists, counselors and educators are to help promote positive marriage and family life experiences for today's adolescents.

840,"Martin, P. E. and R. C. Nelson (1986",The effect of carried loads on the walking patterns of men and women.,"In order to determine the effect of loads worn or carried on walking mechanics, 11 men and 11 women were filmed using high speed cinematography as they performed overground walking at 1Â·78 m/s under five load conditions. The loads included a baseline condition in which subjects carried no added load, and additional loads of approximately 9, 17, 29 and 36 kg consisting of standard military items. The latter two loads were added in the form of a framed rucksack system. Values for several variables frequently used to described temporal and kinematic characteristics of walking were quantified from the film. These included stride length, stride rate, single leg support time, double-support time, swing time and the forward inclination of the trunk. The results of the study demonstrated that the males and females displayed significantly different gait patterns under all load conditions. Not unexpectedly, the females required a higher rate of stepping than the males because of their shorter stride lengths. The results also demonstrated that the walking patterns of both the male and female subjects were affected by the increases in carried load. In general, stride length and swing time decreased while stride rate and double-support time increased with increases in load. There was also an increased forward inclination of the trunk but only for the two heaviest loads which were carried in a rucksack. While the changes in gait characteristics were relatively small for the male subjects, the females were affected to a greater extent thereby demonstrating a greater sensitivity to load magnitude. It was concluded that careful consideration must be given to the absolute loads carried by males and females. Not only is it important for load requirements to be lower for females because of the physiological implications but also because of biomechanical implications and the associated mechanical stresses which must be endured during locomotion. While this study was directed primarily towards military applications, the results should also have implications for load carrying in a variety of situations and environments, including industrial and recreational applications.

A randomized, double-blind clinical trial to assess the impact of vardenafil ODT on duration of erection and its correlation with patients' and partners' sexual quality of life and duration of intercourse: The VADEOPEN study.","Introduction: Stopwatch-assessed duration of erection has been proposed as an objective and reliable efficacy end point for erectile dysfunction (ED) treatments. Aim The aim of this study is to assess vardenafil orodispersible tablets' (ODTs) efficacy in terms of duration of erection and (i) its correlation with other efficacy end points and male and female sexual quality of life (QoL) and (ii) its impact on intercourse duration. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of vardenafil ODT 10 mg on-demand over 12 weeks in 127 patients with ED was carried out. Main Outcome Measures: Primary efficacy end points were stopwatch-assessed duration of erection (min) at any attempt and when leading to successful intercourse, and the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (EF-IIEF) score. Secondary end points were sexual encounter profile (SEP) 3 response rate and male sexual QoL. End points in participating women (N = 46) were stopwatch-assessed duration of intercourse and sexual QoL. Results: At week 12/last observation carried forward, patients taking vardenafil ODT had longer duration of erections (at any attempt or leading to successful intercourse) vs. placebo (least square mean +/- standard error 10.2 +/- 0.9 minutes vs. 7.9 +/- 1.0 minutes, and 10.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 8.3 +/- 1.0 minutes, respectively), and significant increases in EF-IIEF scores, the SEP-3 response, and all sexual QoL items. An increased duration of intercourse was also observed. Female sexual QoL improved significantly. Both duration end points strongly correlated with EF-IIEF scores, and the three end points correlated well with SEP-3 response. Correlation was good with sexual QoL scores in men and women and with duration of intercourse, with differences between treatment groups only for duration end points. Safety was similar in both groups. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence for the consistency and reliability of the stopwatch-assessed duration of erection as an efficacy end point for ED treatments, with ""duration of erection leading to successful intercourse"" showing better properties than duration at any attempt.

(2001",Accounting for post-dissolution relationships.,"This exploratory qualitative research is aimed at investigating the legitimacy of an unconventional personal relationship named ""Post-Dissolution Relationship"" (abbreviated as ""PDR""), which is a cross-sex friendship established by former premarital romantic partners. Such relationships have seldom been studied academically. The data were collected by 32 one-on-one interviews with one partner of PDRs and two joint interviews with both partners of excouples, and the majority of participants were female undergraduate students. Ethnographic analytic induction uncovered ways in which PDR partners present their (non-standard) relationship to ""audiences,"" that is, relevant network members, and ""arguments,"" positive or negative opinions and evaluations about PDRs which appear in talk between PDR partners and their audiences. Analytic induction identified the following five types of audiences and arguments which characterize each type of audiences or its relationships to PDR partners: (1) Type I audiences who support PDRs because they share PDR partners' histories from their past romances through their current platonic friendships. They legitimate PDRs by the four types of supporting arguments: Repairing, Encouraging, Teasing, and Observing; (2) Type II audiences who are PDR partners' newer mutual network members after they dissolved their past romances. Type II audiences and PDR partners legitimate the PDRs by emphasizing the PDRs' disconnection from the past; (3) Type III audiences who criticize PDRs harshly and therefore silence PDR partners. They illegitimate PDRs through their benevolent concern about the potential risks in PDRs or their stubborn suspicion that PDRs are a camouflage for continuing romantic relationships; (4) Type IV audiences who represent society in general. PDR partners justify their PDRs to Type IV audiences by these five arguments: Irreplaceability of the PDR, Detachment from the past, Denial of traumatic dissolution, Nullification of questions about PDRs, Inaccessibility of the PDR partner; and (5) Type V audiences who are PDR partners' new romantic partners. While some Type V audiences recognize their romantic partners' PDRs as beneficial and profitable, the other Type V audiences illegitimate PDRs by defining them as a cause of jealousy.

This was found to be the case in previous research, which concluded that not only are women hesitant to reveal their sexual orientation or ask sexually related information or questions, but also when discussed, were sometimes met with judgment from their primary health care providers. When surveyed, primary health care providers admitted to feeling uncomfortable and incompetent to discuss such issues. The present study was designed to identify areas of improvement for medical health care providers when treating both heterosexual and non-heterosexual patients presenting with sexual issues. Participants were recruited via email through the graduate nursing program at University. The survey collected demographic information, along with responses to the Sexual Attitudes Scale and The Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Knowledge and Attitudes Scale. Finally, participants were randomly assigned two of four possible pairings of vignettes, which presented the participant with possible patient scenarios. One vignette included a non-heterosexual identifying patient while the other included a heterosexual identifying patient, both presenting with a sexual-related complaint. The minimal presence of negative biases was determined through vignette responses and self-report measures. It was predicted that biases would be found between the heterosexual and non-heterosexual vignette scenarios, and that participants who hold negative biases toward the LGB community or general sexual issues, would only offer medical treatment rather than an integrated medical and psychological approach.

Results indicate that religiosity was unrelated to Ss' sexual behavior and use of contraceptives. Very religious Ss were not more likely to abstain from having sexual intercourse than less religious students; religiosity did not influence the effectiveness of contraceptives used by nonvirgins. Ss who had more liberal premarital sexual standards and profeminist Ss became significantly more sexually intimate with their dates than either sexually conservative or sex-role traditional Ss. However, neither premarital sexual standards nor sex-role attitudes were useful for predicting nonvirgins' coital frequency and use of effective contraceptives. The different groups of Ss exhibited remarkably homogeneous sexual and contraceptive behavior. Nonvirgins had coitus sporadically or on the average of only twice a month. In addition, regardless of their values, most nonvirgins were contraceptive risk-takers. Rejecting the most reliable methods that are available (e.g., birth control pills and the intrauterine device), the condom was the most effective contraceptive used by most Ss (57%), and 21% of the nonvirgins relied exclusively on such ineffective contraceptives as withdrawal, trusting in luck, and douching.

Cultural scenarios for sexual scripts are increasingly inculcated by the mass media and electronic technology. Most research published in the past 23 years indicates that cultural scenarios and interpersonal sexual scripts for heterosexuality are changing; the sexual double standard is beginning to erode. Few studies have added to our knowledge of scripts for sequencing the sexual encounter and positioning bodies. Women's non-conscious association of sex with submission predicted lower subjective sexual arousability and lower orgasm ability. There is a continued need to challenge constrictive sexual scripts.

It is suggested that while relied upon to a great degree by law enforcement and the courts, it is important that weaknesses inherent in eyewitness testimony be understood and attended to. It is very important for investigators to avoid influencing a potential eyewitness at any point in the investigative or trial phase of a sex crime and to realize that such influence can occur without any conscious intent on the part of an investigator, or others privy to information. Lineups must be conducted to minimize any contamination of the witness. This involves using a double-blind technique whenever possible, sequential presentations, standard instructions, and documentation of witness confidence at the time of an identification. Investigators must be aware of collateral contamination, where one eyewitness's identification bolsters the confidence of another. It is suggested that investigators should not exclude a suspect from an investigation if an eyewitness cannot make a positive identification when there is other solid evidence that the suspect was involved in the crime.

An introductory section provides an overview and discussion on the implications of equal education for women. Other sections discuss the historical background of equal education for women, women's literacy, the primary school experience, secondary education, technical skills, university education, careers as educators, and full sexual equality in education. History has shown that the changing role and characteristics of womanhood are expressed in the educational arena by women's choice of schools, courses, and preprofessional qualifications. Changes in female access to education both express social transformations and provide an index of future alterations in fertility patterns, family status, marital behavior, and support for ideals of sexual equality. Women's literacy is affected by prejudice, cultural imperatives, and the absence of relevant role models for women at higher stages of academic life which discourage women from making full use of their intellectual talents. Also, educational expectations for men and women remain unequal largely because marriage is regarded as the ideal career for women while the necessity of earning a living is drummed into males from an early age. The educational prospect for women is rapidly changing, though, as shown by the crumbling of the educational double standard in some countries and by United Nations statistical projections that the situation of girls attending schools is improving rapidly.

Noise policy and regulation are usually based on average responses despite potentially large inter-individual differences in the effects of traffic noise on sleep. In this analysis, we investigated what percentage of the total variance in noise-induced awakening reactions can be explained by stable inter-individual differences. Methods: We investigated 69 healthy subjects polysomnographically (mean +/- standard deviation 40 +/- 13 years, range 18-68 years, 32 male) in this randomized, balanced, double-blind, repeated measures laboratory study. This study included one adaptation night, 9 nights with exposure to 40, 80, or 120 road, rail, and/or air traffic noise events (including one noise-free control night), and one recovery night. Results: Mixed-effects models of variance controlling for reaction probability in noise-free control nights, age, sex, number of noise events, and study night showed that 40.5% of the total variance in awakening probability and 52.0% of the total variance in EEG arousal probability were explained by inter-individual differences. If the data set was restricted to nights (4 exposure nights with 80 noise events per night), 46.7% of the total variance in awakening probability and 57.9% of the total variance in EEG arousal probability were explained by inter-individual differences. The results thus demonstrate that, even in this relatively homogeneous, healthy, adult study population, a considerable amount of the variance observed in noise-induced sleep disturbance can be explained by inter-individual differences that cannot be explained by age, gender, or specific study design aspects. Conclusions: It will be important to identify those at higher risk for noise induced sleep disturbance. Furthermore, the custom to base noise policy and legislation on average responses should be re-assessed based on these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,856

The sample consisted of 526 participants ranging in age from 18 to 22 years. Results were analyzed with structural equation modeling and suggest that, although perceived parenting styles and discipline are both correlated with emerging adult emotional adjustment, perceived parenting is associated with emerging adult emotional adjustment for females but not males when examined simultaneously with perceived discipline.

In addition, the induction of lucid dreams has also been used as a way to ameliorate nightmares. On the other hand, lucid dreams may be associated with psychiatric conditions, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Reward Deficiency Syndrome-associated diagnoses. In the latter conditions, lucid dreams can assume an unpleasant and frequently terrifying character. Case presentations: We present two cases of dramatic alleviation of terrifying lucid dreams in patients with PTSD. In the first case study, a 51-year-old, obese woman, diagnosed with PTSD and depression, had attempted suicide and experienced terrifying lucid nightmares linked to sexual/physical abuse from early childhood by family members including her alcoholic father. Her vivid ""bad dreams"" remained refractory in spite of 6 months of treatment with Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and standard pharmaceutical agents which included prazosin, clonidie and Adderall. The second 39-year-old PTSD woman patient had also suffered from lucid nightmares. Results: The medication visit notes reveal changes in the frequency, intensity and nature of these dreams after the complex putative dopamine agonist KB220Z was added to the first patient's regimen. The patient reported her first experience of an extended period of happy dreams. The second PTSD patient, who had suffered from lucid nightmares, was administered KB220Z to attenuate methadone withdrawal symptoms and incidentally reported dreams full of happiness and laughter. Conclusions: These cases are discussed with reference to the known effects of KB220Z including enhanced dopamine homeostasis and functional connectivity of brain reward circuitry in rodents and humans.

(2018",Legal and ethical issues in treating clients with pedohebephilic interests.,"Individuals with a sexual interest in children who have not committed a sexual offense are a client population that are currently underserved by psychologists. In the context of accessing and providing mental health services, mandatory reporting laws represent a key issue for clients and psychologists. For clients, mandatory reporting requirements creates a double-bind: They wish to access psychotherapy for a myriad of psychological concerns, yet they fear the implications of psychologists' mandated reporting requirements if they disclose their sexual interest. Psychologists treating nonoffending clients with sexual interests in children face several overlapping and competing ethical and legal obligations created by mandatory reporting laws. To examine these complexities, the present article reviews and discusses legislation in Canada, complaints to provincial professional colleges, and case law related to mandatory reporting requirements. We additionally review principles and standards in the Canadian Psychological Association's Code of Ethics (4th ed.) to inform service provision with these clients. Recommendations for practice are provided based on this discussion, and practice case vignettes are given to facilitate ethical decision-making.

862,"McQuestion, M., et al. (2012",Psychosocial Processes and Sexual Initiation among Ghanaian Youth.,"This study models primary abstinence and age at first sex in a cross-sectional sample of Ghanaian youth aged 17 to 22 years. The aim is to examine how reproductive knowledge and social cognitive factors jointly affect the choice to initiate sex. Among males, the authors find that reproductive knowledge is negatively associated with abstinence. Its negative association, however, is moderated by the extent of adult support a respondent receives. Among females, reproductive knowledge is positively associated with abstinence. Its positive association is moderated by the extent of household sex communication. Correspondingly, when age at first sex is modeled, knowledge is a negative predictor among females. Its effects are mediated by household sex communication. A third social cognitive variable, perceived permissive peer attitudes about sex, is not associated with knowledge but is a protective factor for sexual initiation for both sexes. Though causal direction cannot be established, the results suggest that cognition affects sexual initiation both directly and through complex social mechanisms. The evidence provides theoretical support for comprehensive adolescent sexual and reproductive health interventions that promote abstinence and other safe sex behaviors through social as well as individual pathways.

865,"Mehrotra, P. (2011",Understanding the sexual behaviors of undergraduate college students in India.,"HIV/AIDS is recognized as a serious public health problem in India with approximately 2.5 million people living with HIV. Young people, aged 15-24 are disproportionately affected, which has been attributed to increasingly liberated attitudes toward sex. Though anecdotal evidence indicates that the age of sexual initiation has been going down in India, there is little scientific research in the area of sexual behaviors of adolescents and young adults. This study sought to understand the determinants of sexual and pre-sexual behaviors of an 18-22 year old college-going population in a large northern city in India. A comprehensive model of health behavior, Multiple Domain Model (MDM), which includes social structural (e.g. age, sex), individual differences (sensation seeking and impulsive decision making), environmental (parental factors and media use), social psychological (attitudes toward sex, peers norms regarding sex and refusal self-efficacy), preparatory behaviors (avoiding/seeking sexual situations) and situational (relationship status and alcohol use) variables, was employed to understand sexual behaviors of late adolescents. Three different models were tested to understand the antecedents of three dependent variables - ever had sex, pre-sexual behaviors and intentions to have sex A cross-sectional study was conducted in four colleges and structural equation modeling was employed to test each model. Ever had sex were predicted by preparatory behaviors - seeking sexual situations, permissive attitudes about having sex, higher scores on gender role -M (masculine factor of BSRI), lower parental control, and more media use. Pre-sexual behaviors were predicted by being in a relationship, seeking sexual situations, alcohol and drug use, and age. Intentions to have sex were predicted by being in a relationship, seeking sexual situations, alcohol/drug use, more permissive attitudes about having sex, peer norms, impulsive decision-making, higher scores on gender role-M and age. Overall it was found that the MDM provides an adequate theoretical framework for understanding sexual behaviors in non-western contexts. MDM, when tested via SEM provides an opportunity to look at the potential pathways of influence on sexual behavior, rather than the impact of individual variables. Implications and potential media interventions to reduce sexual activity in this population are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,865
866,"Meijs, M. H., et al. (2015","Gender stereotype-inconsistent acts are seen as more acceptable than stereotype-consistent acts, if they are clever.","Four studies show that gender stereotype-inconsistent behavior is seen as more acceptable than gender stereotype-consistent behavior, if it is clever. Four studies found consistently that participants rated the behavior of a man who relied on attractiveness or passiveness (stereotypically female) to be more acceptable than similar behavior by a woman. The behavior of a woman who relied on dominance or aggressiveness (stereotypically male) was sometimes seen as more (Study 1A) and sometimes equally (Study 1B, Study 2, Study 3) acceptable as the behavior of a man who acted similarly. This shows that double standards might play a role: Whereas men are benefited by gender stereotype-inconsistent behavior, this is not the case for women. Across studies, these effects were driven by the interpretation of the gender stereotype-inconsistent acts as more clever and less trashy than gender stereotype-consistent acts. These results qualify the idea that people dislike stereotype-inconsistency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,866
867,"Mendes, N., et al. (2014",Sexual and reproductive health of Portuguese adolescents.,"Background: As adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are major sources of morbidity, preventing them is an important health goal for Portuguese society. Objective: To review data on the knowledge, attitudes and statistics on sexual and reproductive health. Methods: A systematic review was conducted including peer-reviewed articles addressing issues influencing the sexuality of Portuguese adolescents (aged 13 to 19), published up to 2011 and conducted in any type of setting. After crossing-cleaning the reference list, 33 articles were included. Results: The rate of sexual activity by Portuguese adolescents is high (44%-95%), but there has been an increase in the age of intercourse debut (currently 15.6 years). Early commencement of sexual intercourse is associated with smoking and regular alcohol consumption. Condoms are the most frequently chosen contraceptive method for first (76%-96%) and subsequent (52%-69%) sexual encounters. The perception of a double standard in sex still exists in teenage culture for both genders and influence behavior. There are significant differences between migrant and native adolescents: African adolescents initiate sexual intercourse at earlier ages and are more likely to have unprotected sex. Only one-third of Portuguese teenagers have ever visited a health facility to seek counseling concerning contraception or STIs, and less than half have ever attended classes on reproductive health. Very few (12%) have knowledge about Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The prevalence of STIs in Portuguese youth is unknown. The adolescent fertility rate is still high (14.7 births per 1000 females aged 15-19 years), but it, as well as the rate of abortion, is steadily decreasing. Conclusions: There is still a long way to go towards promoting a resourceful young population. Citizens and institutions must focus on increasing both the competence of youths and external supports. Information must be provided systematically and health services must have greater accessibility. Studies addressing cultural and environmental determinants that contribute to the molding of the sexual conduct of Portuguese adolescents must be held to produce new and effective culturally sensitive health interventions.

868,"Mensch, B. S. and C. B. Lloyd (1998",Gender differences in the schooling experiences of adolescents in low-income countries: the case of Kenya.,"Although a growing proportion of young people is spending some time in school between puberty and marriage, little research on education in developing countries has been focused on adolescent issues. This article examines the school environment in Kenya and the ways it can help or hinder adolescents. Gender differences are considered with a view toward illuminating some factors that may present particular obstacles or opportunities for girls. Using both qualitative and quantitative data, 36 primary schools in rural areas in three districts of Kenya are studied. These schools are chosen to reflect the spectrum of school quality in the country. The focus in this study is on primary schools because the majority of adolescents in school attend primary school. In these schools, where considerable variation in performance and parental educational status is found, disorganization coexists with strict punishment, minimal comforts are lacking, learning materials are scarce, learning is by rote, and sex education is not provided. In the primary-school-leaving exam, girls' performance is poorer than that of boys. Teachers' attitudes and behavior reveal lower expectations for adolescent girls, traditional assumptions about gender roles, and a double standard about sexual activity. Understanding of the experiences of African adolescents requires an analysis of their schooling environment. The present study used quantitative and qualitative methods to assess adolescents' experiences at 36 primary schools in three districts of Kenya: Nyeri, Nakuru, and Kilifi. The percentages of adolescents 12-18 years of age currently attending primary school were 79%, 81%, and 94%, respectively, in these three districts. The focus of education in primary school is on preparation for the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education exam that determines whether a student can progress to secondary school. School environments tended to be characterized by disorganization, strict punishment, scarce learning materials, rote learning, and sexual harassment of female students. Girls score lower than boys on the exam and have a higher drop-out rate. Teachers' attitudes and behaviors express lower expectations for adolescent girls than boys, traditional assumptions about gender roles, and a double standard regarding sexual behavior. Although schools that had a history of higher test scores tended to employ more female teachers than low-performing schools, they were no more gender-equitable. The lack of encouragement Kenyan girls receive in primary school limits their incentives to continue their education and to delay marriage and childbearing.",0,868
869,"Mercer, G. and P. M.

The liberal-conservative personality/attitude dimension was assessed using measures of authoritarianism, a sex attitude scale, a drug use permissiveness scale, religious attendance, and reported marihuana use. Sexual behaviors measured involved noncoital (necking, petting, heavy petting) and coital frequency and the total numbers of partners for noncoital and coital behaviors. The males' reported greater sex urge is posited as a central explanatory variable in the conservatism/sexuality interrelationship. Although the females reported more frequent attendance at religious services, this did not predict conservative attitudes and behaviors as well for them as for the males, indicating probable differences in the meaning of church attendance for each gender.

Methods: Drug-treatment records were linked to national registers of deaths and hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnoses. For eras 1996/97-2000/01 and 2001/02-2005/06, we calculated cause-specific death-rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) using age-, sex- and calendar-rates of the general Scottish population. Major causes of death were identified by high SMRs (>5 across eras) or rates (>50 per 100,000 person-years in either era), and their time-specific influences characterised by proportional hazards analyses. Results: The SDMD cohort comprised 69,456 individuals, 350,315 person-years and 2590 deaths. The overall SMR reduced from 6.4 (95% CI: 6.0-6.9) to 4.8 (95% CI: 4.6-5.0) between eras. We identified five major causes of death: drug-related (1383 deaths), homicide (118) and infectious diseases (90) with high SMRs; suicide (269) and digestive system disease (168) with high rates. HCV diagnosis marked individuals with at least double the risk of cause-specific mortality, including adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for no HCV diagnosis of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.41-0.53) for drug-related deaths (DRDs) and 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10-0.22) for death from digestive system disease. Increased DRD risk at older age (>34 years) appeared specific to HCV-diagnosed individuals (interaction: chi12 = 7.7 , p = 0.01). Alcohol misuse increased HRs: for DRD (1.76, 95% CI: 1.50-2.06), suicide (1.88, 95% CI: 1.35-2.60), deaths from digestive system disease (3.19, 95% CI: 2.21-4.60) and non-major causes (1.87, 95% CI: 1.49-2.35). Stimulant misuse increased suicide risk: adjusted HR 1.91 (95% CI: 1.43-2.54). Conclusions: Drug-users in Scotland are exposed to variously increased mortality risks. HCV-diagnosed individuals are particularly vulnerable, and may need additional support. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,870
871,"Merriman, B. (2010",Gender differences in family and peer reaction to the adoption of a vegetarian diet.,"Although ethical vegetarianism has been the subject of considerable theoretical attention and debate among feminists, the subject has received little empirical attention. This research note summarizes an interview study with ethical vegetarians of college age, and describes gendered responses to the adoption of a vegetarian diet. While friends and family were neutral or favourable to men's vegetarianism, women vegetarians encountered significant hostility from male family members, in particular. The study is by no means conclusive, but the evidence may suggest that this hostility is rooted in a double standard, wherein men are seen as capable of governing their bodies, while women are not. Despite opposition from male intimates, women participating in the study persisted in their diets, suggesting a high degree of moral autonomy. This tension between individual agency and constraining social and economic structure is at the centre of the ongoing feminist debate on vegetarianism, and the findings presented here invite further discussion and more targeted research.

872,"Meyer, V. F. (1991",A critique of adolescent pregnancy prevention research: the invisible white male.,"This study examined sex and race bias in recently published research on adolescent pregnancy prevention. Descriptive statistics from 71 citations showed that of 33 articles that focused on a single sex, only one was on males (inner city, presumably minority). Of the remaining articles, the majority either did not differentiate between the sexes or provided only minimal data on sex differences. The consequences of research that ignores or minimizes the male contribution to the adolescent pregnancy problem are discussed. The examination of gender bias is made in the search through US research on adolescent pregnancy prevention published between the Summer, 1985 and Fall, 1988. 71 citations were analyzed and included original research, review articles, editorials, and letters generated through Medline and PsychLit databases. 33 articles focused on a single sex (32 on female, 1 on males); 38 were on both sexes with females predominating, of which 18 were gender neutral of nondifferentiating, 19 provided minimal sex differences, and only 1 used gender in the analysis. Of the 21 ethnic articles, 2 and a half times more studies were done on minorities as whites (15 versus 6). 56% did not specify ethnic origins. The consequence of sex-based or sex-neutral research is the reinforcement of cultural bias and it contributes to the problem. Cultural assumptions behind methodologies needs to be explored. The focus is problematic female behavior that needs explanation and change. Males thus become invisible in their irresponsibility for fertility decisions. All pregnancy prevention research shows that female attitudes and behavior are more conducive to change. The larger problem of male attitudes becomes obfuscated. Research focusing on adolescents is also problematic because of the power imbalance or the sexual double standard, which is ignored in sex natural research. It has been found that low female influence on sexual decisions is related to more frequent coitus and less regular contraceptive use. Considered opinion is that no power differential would deemphasize pregnancy prevention on women. Terminology used indicated that adolescent in the title referred to females only or both sexes. The only male article was also identified as inner city. There was no generic terms for white males, in spite of the bulk of medical and social research with generic terms referring to white males. Qualifiers are used for women and minorities. Inner city, urban, and low socioeconomic status (SES) terms were frequently related to blacks or other minorities. Whites of low SES and blacks of high SES are invisible. Factors are not differentiated in the association with economic or minority status and/or culture. Although black teenage pregnancies are not the majority of teen pregnancies, this is imprinted in the public mind. The rate only is greater, but racial differences have declined recently. Research should no reflect sexist assumptions.",0,872
873,"Mezquita, L., et al. (2017",Effects of social attitude change on smoking heritability.,"Societal attitudes and norms to female smoking changed in Spain in the mid-twentieth century from a restrictive to a tolerant, and an even pro-smoking, posture, while social attitudes remained stable for males. We explored whether this difference in gender-related social norms influenced the heritability of two tobacco use measures: lifetime smoking and number of years smoking. We used a population-based sample of 2285 twins (mean age = 55.78; SD = 7.45; 58% females) whose adolescence began between the mid-1950s and the early 1980s. After modeling the effect of sex and year of birth on the variance components, we observed that the impact of the genetic and shared environmental factors varied differently by birth cohort between males and females. For females, shared environment explained a higher proportion of variance than the genetic factors in older cohorts. However, this situation was inverted in the younger female cohorts. In contrast, no birth cohort effect was observed for males, where the impact of the genetic and environmental factors remained constant throughout the study period. These results suggest that heritability is larger in a permissive social environment, whereas shared-environmental factors are more relevant in a society that is less tolerant to smoking.

This investigation may bear special importance for an adolescent (as opposed to child) population, because hormonal and metabolism differences between sexes are most likely to emerge at this time. Male (n = 19) and female (n = 16) adolescents, ages 16-19 with ADHD, participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study evaluating the effectiveness of osmotic-release methylphenidate, extended release amphetamine salts, placebo, and routine limited medication regimen. Medication efficacy was evaluated using ADHD symptom ratings from adolescent self-report and parent report, along with objective measures of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity during driving performance and neuropsychological tasks. Males and females were largely equivalent in impairment, and medication was similarly effective in reducing symptoms. No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects. This finding suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release stimulant medications is equivalent for male and female adolescents with ADHD.

Bunk (2007). The part played by gender in wars and revolutions is at once such a commonplace ('our boys' go to war) and such an overlooked conception. Brian D. Bunk's book on the origins of the Spanish Civil War, however, succeeds in creating this vital intersection between history, emotion and cultural representation, while subtly pointing out the contradictions and oversimplifications. One of the various advantages of the book is the way it fits squarely into Spanish historiography, aimed at professional Hispanists and historians, whilst remaining of interest to those working in other fields, such as gender and cultural studies. Without prejudice Bunk makes the Spanish national track record on gender abundantly clear. As he progresses he gives a transparent and fair outline of the centuries of celebrated machismo or venerable 'protective masculinity' that still points up the patent double standard, which even Brodie could not overcome through her erotomaniacal faith in heroism, action and Joyce Emily. Indeed, it highlights the deeply inculcated and dangerously self-renewing association of femaleness with either victim or enemy, which not only prejudices its representation in conflicts, but helps to start real ones in the first place.

Systematic investigation of the placebo effect emerged in the 1950s in response to the development of randomized controlled clinical trials that used ""inert"" placebo interventions as a pivotal element of scientific evaluation of novel drugs. In recent years, scientific and scholarly investigation of the placebo effect has increased dramatically, reflecting a growing interest in the connection between mind and body with respect to health, the development of brain imaging techniques, dissatisfaction with the reductionist and technological orientation of biomedicine, and growing attention to the use of complementary and alternative medical treatments.

Studies suggest a distinction between en bloc (complete memory loss) and fragmentary (off-and-on memory loss) blackouts; however, research has not consistently differentiated between these 2 forms of blackout. This study aimed to validate the distinction between en bloc and fragmentary blackouts among young adults. Methods: Data were collected using qualitative (Study 1) and quantitative (Study 2) research methods. Participants in both studies were college students with a history of alcohol-induced memory impairment. They were recruited using community advertisement (Study 1, N = 50, 56% female) and Qualtrics survey panels (Study 2, N = 350, 56% female). Study 1 participants engaged in 8 focus groups. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using applied thematic analysis. Findings guided assessment of en bloc and fragmentary blackout in Study 2. In Study 2, a separate sample of participants completed an online survey assessing drinking behavior, alcohol-induced memory impairment, and theoretical correlates of en bloc and fragmentary blackouts. Results: Study 1 participants differentiated between en bloc and fragmentary blackouts (which they referred to as ""blackouts"" and ""brownouts,"" respectively) based on duration and extent of memory loss. They indicated that blackouts occur along a continuum, with en bloc ""blackouts"" at the extreme. They also stated that the term ""blackout drinking"" does not always imply memory loss. Study 2 participants reported higher rates of ""brownouts"" (81%) than ""blackouts"" (54%). They reported less negative outcome expectancies and attitudes, greater personal approval, higher prevalence estimates, lower self-efficacy, and stronger intentions for ""brownouts"" than ""blackouts"" (p < 0.001). Women perceived ""blackouts/brownouts"" as more prevalent than men and reported lower intentions to experience ""blackouts"" (p < 0.005).

882,"Mills, R. M. (2000",“That tyrant custom”: The politics of custom in the poetry and prose of Augustan women writers.,"The Augustan Age saw a rise in the number of women who published polemical texts in defence of their sex. Natural Philosophy and Cartesian rationalism greatly influenced these writers in their arguments againstthe nature- and scripture-based beliefs in women's inherent inferiority, but so too did seventeenth-century political debates between patriarchalists (Tories) and contractarians (Whigs). Whilst claiming their rights as free men, male Whig authors would often denounce Custom's arbitrary influence over political powerstructures and succession within the state, but they did not usually extend their arguments about Custom's tyranny to include its negative effects on women. Exasperated by double standards, Augustan women writers adapted the rhetoric of Whig partisan politics in their polemical, protofeminist texts in order to highlight both the shortcomings of Whig logic and the inequalities between men and women in the state and in the family. By decrying Custom's adverse effects on women, protofeminist writers carried liberal logic through to their genderdebates where Whig authors had faltered in partisan politics.

(2008",Vardenafil in men with stable statin therapy and dyslipidemia.,"Introduction: Phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors have previously been evaluated for their efficacy and safety in various clinical trials in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) with or without associated comorbidities. Aim: This is the first prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a PDE-5 inhibitor (i.e., vardenafil) in an exclusive population of men with ED and dyslipidemia. Main Outcome Measures: Three coprimary efficacy measurements (Sexual Encounter Performance [SEP]2, SEP3, International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function [IIEF-EF] domain scores) were used to assess the differential effect of vardenafil vs. placebo in this patient population. Adverse events (AEs) safety data were obtained to compare safety outcomes. Methods: This 12-week of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 59 U.S. centers. Patients received either on-demand, flexible-dose vardenafil 10 mg (titrated to 5 mg or 20 mg based upon efficacy and safety) or placebo. Results: Of the 712 patients screened and entered into the study, 395 were randomized. Baseline demographics for the intent-to-treat population included: mean age, 54.4 years (>=7.5 standard deviation [SD]); 76% Caucasian; mean body mass index (BMI), 31.7 kg/m2 (+/-12.7 SD); 47% past/present smoker; and 42% severe ED. Aside from dyslipidemia, other comorbidities included hypertension, 61%; obesity (i.e., BMI >= 30), 51%; and type 1 or 2 diabetes, 40%. During the 12-week treatment period, the least squares (LS) adjusted mean success rates in patients on vardenafil vs. placebo were: SEP2, 79.09% vs. 51.92%; and SEP3, 66.69% vs. 33.83% (P < 0.001). The LS adjusted mean IIEF-EF domain score for week 12 using LOCF was 21.99 in patients on vardenafil therapy vs. 14.83 in those on placebo (P < 0.001). The most commonly encountered AEs were headache and nasal congestion. Conclusions: Vardenafil was demonstrated to be safe and effective for managing ED in men with ED and associated dyslipidemia. The results of this study support the role of expanded research on outcomes related to effective ED treatment and aggressive lipid control.

Method: One hundred eighty-nine outpatients (49.7% female, mean [SD] age 45 [15] years) with D5M-IV diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) were recruited from April 13, 2005, to December 22, 2009, at the Massachusetts General Hospital and at Butler Hospital. Patients were randomized for 12 weeks to SAMe 1,600 3,200 mg/d, escitalopram 10 20 mg/d, or placebo. Doses were escalated at 6 weeks in the event of nonresponse.The main outcome measure was the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-1 7). Tolerability was assessed by the Systematic Assessment forTreatment of Emergent Events-Specific Inquiry (SAFTEE-SI). Results: All 3 treatment arms demonstrated a significant improvement ofabout 5 6 points in HDRS-1 7 scores (P< .001 for all), and no significant differences were observed between the treatment arms (P>.05 for all). Response rates in the intent-to- treat sample were 36% for SAMe, 34% for escitalopram, and 30% for placebo. Remission rates were 28% for SAMe, 28% for escitalopram, and 17% for placebo. No comparisons between treatment groups attained significance (P> .05 for all). Tolerability was good, with gastrointestinal side effects (19% for stomach discomfort and 20% for diarrhea) as the most common in the SAMe arm. Significant differences were observed between treatment groups for dizziness, anorgasmia, diminished mental acuity, and hot flashes (P< .05 for all). Conclusions: The results fail to support an advantage over placebo for either the investigational treatment SAMe or the standard treatment escitalopram for MDD.

886,"Mitchell, J. (1975",Moral dilemmas of early adolescence.,"Discusses some of the significant moral dilemmas that confront adolescents between ages 10 and 16, including sexual behavior, independence, conscience, double standards, and conformity. In the sexual behavior dilemma, adolescents find that sex drives are strong but that sexual behavior is taboo. They sample different behaviors and inner feelings and formulate their own moral viewpoints, but until their outlooks are crystallized, they may be pulled in different directions. As adolescents pursue independence, they experience a dilemma which involves being honest to the self while also being honest to parents. In the conscience dilemma, adolescents are faced with learning to outgrow the limitations of childhood morality while at the same time being existentially linked to it. In reconciling various growth adjustments which must be made, adolescents may find that the reconcilitation process poses a dilemma because there is no way it can be encountered honestly without anxiety. Adolescents have particular trouble with the double standard--behavior accepted in one situation but outlawed in another. Adolescents engage in a good deal of behavior they simply deny if questioned; this most commonly occurs in regard to behavior thought to be wrong by adults but not by adolescents. Finally, perhaps the most pervasive moral dilemma has to do with role conformity vs personal autonomy. The behavior required for peer group acceptance may contradict adolescents' inner expections of themselves and their need for autonomy. It is pointed out that all these dilemmas are not manifestations of growth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,886
887,"Mizejewski, L. (2010",,"In a December 1988 cover story in Ms., film critic Molly Haskell remarked that Meryl Streep ""made a fetish out of not giving the public what it wants and expects from a star"" (""Meryl Streep: Hiding in the Spotlight,"" 68). This assessment suggests the specifically feminist stakes of her stardom in the 1980s that saw Streep's rapid ascent to fame and acclaim followed by gradual decline in popularity and reputation. In a period characterized by bitter backlash against feminism, the media bristled with contentions about femininity, changing gender roles, and the new figure of the superwoman who tantalizingly balanced family and career. Although Streep resisted and protested the roles of both superwoman and superstar, her career trajectory in the 1980s is haunted by these cultural figurations and by conflicting discourses about her femininity. Indeed, her perceived lack of glamour-the essence of femininity for Hollywood stardom-was a key element of the failed expectations referenced by Haskell. Femininity was a prickly topic in the aftermath of the women's movement, as suggested by the film with which Streep capped the 1980s, the feminist satire She-Devil (1989), in which she parodied an ultra-feminine celebrity whose luxurious lifestyle is ruined by marriage and children. The expectations for Streep's stardom had been especially high at the beginning of the decade. Appearing on the covers of major magazines, Streep was named ""America's best actress"" (Life, April 1981, 80), ""A Star for the 80s"" (Newsweek, 7 January 1980), and ""Magic"" (Time, 7 September 1981, 38). Streep starred in a major motion picture every year, moving easily across nationalities and social strata in roles that revealed her exceptional range and virtuosity as an actress, and in particular her skill with voices and languages, enabling her to take on entirely different accents and personae: British, The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981); Polish, Sophie's Choice (1982); Danish, Out of Africa (1985); Australian, A Cry in the Dark/Evil Angels (1988); working-class activist, Silkwood (1983); disillusioned resistance fighter, Plenty (1985); and homeless alcoholic, Ironweed (1987). By the end of the 1980s, there had emerged what Karen Hollinger calls a ""Meryl Streep film""-complex, literate, and focused on a challenging, multifaceted heroine (73-74). In the first half of the decade, Streep appeared in high-profile films with mainstream appeal. Except for Plenty, all these films resulted in Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, with a win for Sophie's Choice. In less notable films, she portrayed an alluring murder suspect in the psychological thriller Still of the Night (1982), a married woman resisting adultery in Falling in Love (1984), and a betrayed wife and mother in Heartburn (1986). Throughout this time, she was honored with multiple awards and tributes, evidence that peers and reviewers indeed considered her one of America's best actresses.1 Yet despite this standing, Streep's box office appeal and grosses greatly diminished by the end of the decade. Her reputation suffered regarding her acting style, her refusal of celebrity, and her choice of increasingly unpleasant character roles; her remarkable skill with accents and her ability to assume any nationality or ethnicity were admired but also criticized as impersonation rather than acting. Indeed, as a star better known for her voice than for her body, Streep's stardom posed a significant disruption of the image-based Hollywood star system. Theater critic Hilton Als describes her estrangement from this system as ""her disavowal of the American urge to cultivate personal glamour"" (""Wagon Train: 'Mother Courage' at the Delacorte,"" New Yorker, 4 September 2006, 132). Although Streep took some traditionally glamorous roles at the beginning of the decade, she was entirely willing to portray unattractive women as well, and reviewers' hostility toward the roles or the social messages of these films are often manifested in comments on her appearance-that is, her refusal to look like a movie star or to act like one as well, and eschewing publicity, guarding her privacy, and, as Haskell put it, refusing to give the public ""what it wants and expects from a star."" Even Streep's reputation as a hard-working actress sometimes ricocheted. Some critics reproached her for an acting style that foregrounded its own techniques. Paul Attanasio said her critics ""charged that she always seemed to be watching herself in the mirror, that her performances are too 'worked out'"" (""Meryl Streep and the Human Connection,"" Washington Post, 25 July 1986). A related objection was Streep's ""predeliction for picking roles that efface all trace of her own identity"" (Ron Rosenbaum, ""Unnatural Actresses,"" Mademoiselle, January 1989, 46). New Yorker critic Pauline Kael, who had disliked Streep's mannerisms from the start, was the most prominent voice among her detractors, complaining that the lack of identity from role to role amounted to a lack of ""presence"" in Streep's performances: ""An actress with a vivid presence might give the role something of her own substance,"" she wrote of Streep's acting in Plenty, ""but Meryl Streep isn't that kind of actress. She's strictly an interpreter"" (7 October 1985, 129). These responses to Streep's self-conscious techniques and lack of a core persona or ""presence"" are crucial to the conflicted status of her stardom, a status she herself disdained. In one interview Streep said, ""If you want to be a superstar, it seems to me you have to hire a press agent and do kinky things to get into the columns. If that's what it takes, I don't want to be a superstar"" (Ladies' Home Journal, March 1980, 36.). Eight years later, she reiterated, ""I'm not a star. I think you become a star only if you want it"" (Ladies' Home Journal, October 1988, 62). In these and other dismissals of stardom, Streep seemed to equate stardom with the ""superstardom"" of celebrity-the focus on an actor's personality and personal life rather than the film texts. Indeed, Streep fiercely guarded the details of her personal life, refusing to ""become 'celebrity junk food,'"" as she told Brad Darrach (Life, December 1987, 78). She shunned public events, granted few interviews, and tightly controlled information about herself and her family. Mapping Streep's stardom onto the issues of motherhood, feminism, and femininity in the 1980s, Karen Hollinger describes Streep as ""the postfeminist woman in crisis, torn between her career aspirations and her desire to be a traditional housewife"" (96). She suggests that Streep's stardom exposes rather than resolves the contradictory demands of post-feminism, a term that emerged in the early 1980s with multiple meanings. The term most often implies that the women's movement succeeded in securing equal rights for women so that feminism is no longer relevant and women can now enjoy endless choices concerning career, personal lifestyle, and the pleasures of both sexuality and commodities. As this suggests, post-feminism trumps politics with consumerism, positing that women now face choices rather than conflicts. Focusing on gains made by white, upper-class, heterosexual women-exactly the kind of privileged professional exemplified by Streep-post-feminism tends to overlook the economic and racial problems of the less privileged. The problem is that while the civil rights movement opened doors and passed legislation, many things about gender did not change at all-the assumption that women still assume responsibility for emotional relationships, the household, and childcare, for example, or the double standard about attractiveness that makes a woman's looks a priority in how she is perceived. As a ""star for the 80s,"" Streep was prime material for these cultural narratives about gender roles in transition. It was a decade in which Glamour magazine ran an editorial entitled, ""When Someone Calls You 'Feminine,' Is That a Compliment or Not?"" (July 1988, 44). The question goes to the heart of Streep's significance in cinema and culture. Â© 2010 by Rutgers University Press. All rights reserved.",0,887

This article rehabilitates the discourse and activity of church-women - not least Ellice Hopkins - who were prominent campaigners for social purity. Women purity workers exerted enormous pressure upon the professional hierarchies of church and chapel, actively reworking Christian readings of the body so as to bring the moral influence of the churches to bear upon public opinion. In so doing they brought about a significant transformation in clerical attitudes that regarded discussions of sex as beyond the boundaries of civilized discourse and led in the promotion of a regulatory, but nonetheless highly public, religious discourse on sexuality.

(2017",5-HT6 receptor antagonist as an adjunct treatment targeting residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: Unexpected sex-related effects (double-blind placebo-controlled trial).,"Background: Treating patients who experience residual psychotic symptoms during remission of schizophrenia remains one of the most challenging problems. The mechanisms underlying these symptoms differ from those of acute hallucinations and delusions. 5-HT6 receptor antagonists have been considered promising agents in treatment of residual psychotic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a selective 5-HT6 inhibitor Avisetron in the reduction of residual psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic therapy. Methods: Eighty clinically stable outpatient subjects with schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms were randomized in a double-blind manner to 6 weeks of Avisetron or placebo at 1:1 ratio. Subjects received 8 mg of Avisetron or placebo on top their stable antipsychotic treatment. Standard clinical scales and cognitive tests were used for endpoint assessment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction of total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score after 6 weeks of treatment. Results: No significant differences in the primary and secondary endpoints were found between the groups. However, based on the subgroup analysis, the significant improvement of total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score and residual psychotic symptoms was observed in female patients. Conclusions: It was a negative study with unexpected benefits of the drug only in females. We hypothesized that the role of patients' sex can impact the treatment response to serotonergic drugs in general. We suggest a possible synergistic interaction between estrogen and Avisetron by means of modulating the effect of estrogens on the serotonergic system. Future studies targeting the sex-related effects of serotonergic drugs are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,890

In another series of experiments, 377 Ss were shown explicit color films depicting face-to-face coitus or oral-genital sex. Over 80% of the Ss reported genital sensations in response to the films. Females tended to report an increase in negative feelings, while males reported an increase in positive feelings. However, the viewing had little effect on subsequent sexual behavior. Low sex-guilt women reported more breast sensations, and high sex-guilt women reported less genital arousal, especially to the oral-sex film. In a comparable study with 32 married couples, it was the high rather than low sex-guilt males who reported an increase in positive feelings.

Here I hope to add to the History of Navigation through the study of unique objects rather than through a reorganization of the standard secondary and hereto acceptable primary sources. The result will not take the form of a comprehensive and balanced account, but should introduce a level of perception which may otherwise be lacking.

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.

A minimum Clinical Global Impression of Severity rating of Moderately Depressed and a clinician 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of 15 or greater, with the depressed mood item score of at least 2 were required for study entry. Measurements: Patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I) ratings obtained using an interactive voice response (IVR) computer-automated telephone system prior to and following playback of impromptu patient recordings obtained prior to the start of treatment (MERET). Results: MERET PGI-I ratings differentiated the effects of drug treatment from placebo more effectively than did standard PGI-I ratings. The drug-placebo treatment effect size obtained using standard PGI-I ratings was 0.525, whereas the effect size with MERET PGI-I ratings was 0.612. Conclusion: The enhanced drug-placebo separation appeared to be primarily due to increased patients' perceptions of drug treatment effectiveness. Patients perceiving the greatest degree of clinical improvement indicated more benefit from hearing the MERET recordings. MERET appears to be a viable method for enhancing patients' insights into the benefits of effective treatments by allowing them to use personal descriptions provided in their own words and voice.

897,"Murphy, A. (2008",History without the standard patriarchal bias.,"In a review and integrative analysis of the literature on prehistorical human societies, new insights and hypotheses on unresolved issues are logically derived, and implications for the dynamic future are discussed. It may be difficult for many to overcome their infantile, sexist subconscious biases to recognize the likely reality that human societies are most naturally ruled by women. No other known hypothesis fits the aggregated anthropological and neuroscientific facts even remotely as well. While each piece of evidence alone is insufficient to conclude that matriarchies were the norm until thousands of years ago, the combined collection of facts is rather overwhelming. Thousands of years of cruel patriarchal tyranny have been unable to eliminate the evidence and tendencies. Although archaeologists and anthropologists tend not to speak on issues with non-patriarchal tendencies without overwhelming evidence (Gadon, 1989), my own hypothesis is that both the relatively faster growth in the size of the females and the increase in intelligence may very well have contributed to ending the dominating alpha male or patriarchal system among early hominoid types. Larger females armed with brains and tools or even weapons, such as the double-bladed instruments found to be millions of years old (Jurmain et al., 2004) that appeared about the time women started to grow closer to the height of men, could have fought off not only predators but also alpha males. Given the natural creative, nurturing, and pleasure-enhancing capacities of women, a special reverence for females would have normally evolved as human intelligence levels rose. The rule by women prior to 6000 years ago apparently was of a more egalitarian sort, with nonviolent forms of persuasion being the norm. Â© Common Ground.",0,897

The college was sampled in 1974, 1979, and 1986. Sexual behavior increased dramatically from 1974 to 1979 and then decreased in 1986 to approximately where it was in 1974. The reason for this change, and findings regarding the relationships between sexual behavior and many of the variables cited above are discussed. 3 samples of college students at a small New England liberal arts college received questionnaires regarding their sexual philosophies, behavior, relationship with most recent partner, self-perceived attractiveness, relationship with parents, use of drugs and alcohol, attitudes toward marriage and abortion, and other subjects.

The authors speculate that the spread of herpes contributed to this trend reversal. The 1980s also brought more common knowledge of chlamydia trachomatis, nonspecific urethritis, and AIDS. There is some evidence that the double standard for sexual behavior is not present for the most recent sample, though men are still more apt to desire sex without concern for a strongly bonded relationship. Still, in 1986, they showed some evidence of movement toward having sex within a more committed relationship as compared to men in 1974. It is conjectured that the data reflect an increase in individualism and a weakening of the influence of religion and parental relationship on sexual behavior. author's modified",0,898
899,"Myall, D., et al. (2017",Parkinson's in the oldest old: Impact on estimates of future disease burden.,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally the risk of Parkinson's has been considered to increase monotonically with age, although there is evidence that prevalence and incidence may decrease in the oldest old. To examine this further we estimated the national prevalence and incidence of Parkinson's in New Zealand, using drug-tracing methods, to examine the relationship of Parkinson's with sex and age up to 100+. METHODS: Information on Parkinson's-related medications was extracted from the national pharmaceutical database of community-dispensed medications from 2005 to 2014. Diagnoses for a large subset of individuals were independently determined through national mortality and hospital admissions datasets. We used a Bayesian model, accommodating diagnostic uncertainty and bias, to estimate the number of people with Parkinson's. RESULTS: The 2013 prevalence of Parkinson's in New Zealand was 191 per 100 000 population (95% uncertainty interval 187-194) with age-standardized prevalence rates higher for males (ratio 1.7:1). Incidence was 29 per 100 000 person-years (95% uncertainty interval 29-30), also higher in males (ratio 1.7:1). Incidence and prevalence by age increased exponentially until 75 years, peaked at 85 years, and then dropped sharply. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Parkinson's in New Zealand is expected to double over a 25-year period but then increase at a slower rate due to the drop-off in prevalence and incidence in the oldest old. The findings suggest that Parkinson's disease is not an aging-dependent but an age-dependent disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,899

It must be remembered that to work steadily every day and in the same place is not an innate circumstance of man's life. For the untold centuries before he developed into an agriculturist and a handicraftsman, he sought his food and his protection in the simplest way and with little steady labor. The work-conscience is as variably developed as any other type of conscience. There are those who are rogues in all else but not in their work. They will not turn out a bad piece of work for they have identified the best in them with their work. Contrariwise, there are others who are punctilious in all other phases of morality who are slackers of an easy standard in their work efforts. This is as truly a double standard of morals as anything in the sex sphere,--and as disastrous. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,901
902,"Nadeau, L. and K. Harvey (1995",Women's alcoholic intoxication: The origins of the double standard in Canada.,"This article hypothesizes that the gender division in the drinking practices of men and women finds its origin in the nineteenth century. Very few historians have studied Canadian drinking patterns prior to the Temperance movement, which commenced in Canada at the end of the the 1820s. Evidence of a possible double standard concerning female intoxication is virtually nonexistent. When temperance mobilized the masses and became a popular crusade, women of both Upper and Lower Canada joined the movement. In this period, as in the pretemperance era, evidence was found of a double standard concerning female intoxication but the findings are no extremely clear. Women entered the forefront of the Temperance movement through the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. This membership believed that it was women's moral duty to protect the home against society's ills, and women were ultimately made responsible for male drunkenness. Furthermore, ideas about female purity precluded any sustained discussion of women's drinking. Abstention from alcohol thus became incorporated into the very definition of what was considered female.

903,"Naffine, N. (1989",Towards justice for girls: Rhetoric and practice in the treatment of status offenders.,"Feminist critics of American juvenile justice have often observed the presence of a sexual double standard. Young men, it seems, may explore their sexuality with impunity. The sexually active young woman, however, is likely to be defined as âincorrigibleâ or âuncontrolledâ and charged with the youthful crime of status offending. The plight of Australian girls charged with such offences is less well documented. This paper examines and contrasts American and Australian policies in relation to young women before the courts and finds strong parallels. Though the general trend in both countries has been towards greater parity of treatment of the sexes, there is evidence to suggest a recent return to more paternalistic forms of juvenile justice.

(1981",A measure of individual modernism in Brazilian women.,"Presents a questionnaire that was designed to measure modernism, a set of attitudes and beliefs that include an orientation toward the future and a sense of personal efficiency as well as rejection of traditional sex roles. A pilot study conducted in Sao Paulo from 1973 to 1974 resulted in the reduction of the original 50-item scale to a 13-item ""machismo scale,"" which appeared to be unidimensional yet still measured a variety of attitudes such as moral double-standard, belief in male superiority, and desirability of employment for women. Findings of a subsequent study conducted with 170 Brazilian women from various socioeconomic backgrounds showed that the machismo scale had a high negative correlation with education (r = -0.60; p < 0.01), and exposure to such mass media as periodicals, newspapers, TV, and radio (r = -0.45; p < 0.01). These results suggest that rejection of ""machismo"" and traditional roles is an important component of individual modernism among Brazilian women and that the machismo scale developed for this study is a reasonably valid measuring instrument for this purpose.

In order to validate this hypothesis, 108 males had to make a decision and to justify the recommendation of male or female applicants with a profile suited or not to the job's requirements. The results validated the expectations regarding several dimensions: male and female applicants with a high profile were more often recommended than low-profiled applicants, but the content analysis of the justification given highlighted the link between the gender category of the applicant and requirements usually demanded at work. Language marks of attractiveness, credibility and dynamism tended to be used more often in the corpus related to male than to female applicants. The results are discussed in terms of sexist routines, double standard in evaluating males and females, and strategies to conceal gender prejudice in the public place.

(2012","Cigarette smoking and drinking behavior of migrant adolescents and young adults in Hanoi, Vietnam.","Purpose: There has been a large migration from rural to urban areas in much of the developing world. In the past, this was less true in Vietnam, which remains largely agricultural; however, since the 1990s, economic reforms and loosening of government policies that had previously limited movement have led to a large increase in this rural to urban population movement. Risky health behaviors have been found among migrants in many other settings. The purpose of this research was to determine whether migrant adolescents and young adults in the city of Hanoi are more or less likely than local ones to engage in cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking health risk behaviors, to identify factors associated with these behaviors, and to suggest interventions to reduce these health risk behaviors among the study population. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 4,550 adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years was conducted in urban Hanoi in 2006. This study examines current use of cigarettes and alcohol by migration status using multivariate logistic regressions. Results: Cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol are male phenomena. The prevalence of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking is high among adolescents and young adults in Hanoi and is more common among migrants who came from rural areas of other provinces than nonmigrants in the city. However, multivariate analysis revealed that migrants were neither more likely to smoke cigarettes nor drink alcohol than nonmigrants after controlling for other factors, such as age, full-time worker status, depression, and having close friends who smoke and/or drink. Conclusions: The results suggest that interventions aiming at smoking and/or drinking reduction should pay more attention to adolescents, especially males, changing health risk behaviors at school and at work, and peer influence than their migration status.

910,"Nichols, A. (2017",The influence of ethnicity and gender on the leadership experiences of female Asian American managers.,"Asian Americans represent the fastest-growing, best-educated, and highest-income demographic in the United States. The successful status of Asians Americans is reflected in the fact that they are collectively associated with a ""model minority"" stereotype that characterizes them in terms of traits such as their being academically-oriented, high-achieving, studious, law-abiding and hard-working. Yet despite the apparent success of Asians Americans as a whole and the positive stereotypes associated with this minority, compared to other women of color, Asian women are significantly less likely to hold leadership positions, including both mid-level and top-level management positions. This study attempted to understand the reason for this gap. Using a grounded theory methodology, this study explored the lived experiences of 16 Asian American female middle managers working in Fortune 1000 in order to understand the influence of ethnicity and gender on their leadership experiences and career opportunities. The study's results revealed that the participants had complex and conflicting experiences that resulted in both opportunities and challenges. Participants sometimes benefited from the positive associations of their Asian ethnicity with qualities such as intelligence and diligence. Yet, the other qualities associated with the model minority stereotype, particularly the view that Asians are passive and lacking in social skills, could also limit opportunities and reinforce a view of Asians as passive and lacking in leadership abilities. Participants also revealed that a woman's gender identity can have a similarly limiting effect on career progression. In fact, one of the principal findings of this study was the existence of an insider culture within corporate America that upholds the importance of male-orientated personality traits and leadership qualities. The experiences of participants revealed that both women and minorities often have difficulties conforming to the norms and values of this culture, or they may be subjected to a negative double standard if they attempt to do so. As a result, they may be unable to penetrate insider culture, effectively coming against a glass ceiling as they attempt to move up the corporate ladder.

(2006",Female Sexual Satisfaction and Pharmaceutical Intervention: A Critical Review of the Drug Intervention Studies in Female Sexual Dysfunction.,"Introduction: A considerable number of double-blind randomized controlled studies investigating the effects of pharmaceutical intervention on female sexual functioning have been published in recent years. However, a comparison between outcomes of various studies is difficult as no generally accepted/correct approach to research has been established yet. To be able to translate trial results to daily clinical practice, current limitations and issues in drug intervention studies in female sexual dysfunction (FSD) need to be clarified. Aim: To evaluate the needs in research into intervention in FSD by reviewing published studies. Methods. A systematic review of double-blind randomized controlled intervention trials on FSD. Main Outcome Measures: Definitions of study populations, inclusion and exclusion criteria, use of power calculations, outcome measures and treatment duration. Results: A total of 25 double-blind randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of pharmaceutical intervention on female sexual functioning have been published. Of these, 11 studies required the diagnosis of FSD as an inclusion criterion. A standard methodology for research in this field is lacking. Significant differences in population inclusion requirements and tools for the measurement of change in sexual functioning were identified as major limiting factors. Conclusions: The investigation of FSD is an evolving area in that new definitions and a new model for female sexual functioning have been recently proposed. There is a need for experts in the field and regulating authorities to reach a consensus regarding appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for FSD trials and main outcome measures appropriate for the evaluation of drug interventions. This consensus should also determine which treatment effect is considered to be clinically relevant. Treatment efficacy and clinical relevance should be related to outcomes which are meaningful for affected women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,911
912,"No authorship, i. (1984",II: Sexist treatment in the mental health system: The evidence.,"Discusses sexist treatment in the mental health services offered to women, asserting that the mental health delivery system needs to examine whether it is sensitive enough to the norms of women's lives and the effects of their pervasive powerlessness and 2nd-class status. It is noted that, rather than addressing causes, mental health professionals have treated the symptoms of women's 2nd-class status. Previous research has shown that clinical judgments about healthy female and male traits differ and that clinicians' perceptions of characteristics of mentally healthy individuals conform more closely to male than to female stereotypes, which indicates a double standard of mental health for men and women. Help sought by women is often contingent on the extent to which they adhere to societal norms and expectations, and diagnosis may also be based on stereotypical assumptions. Suggestions for therapists to counteract this situation are provided. Sexual exploitation of women in the therapeutic relationship is also discussed, and examples of blatant and subtle forms of such exploitation are described. Whether overt or subtle in nature, sexual exploitation hurts clients and cannot be condoned. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,912

Recommendations by a women's task force stress the need for administrators and supervisors to hire mental health consultants who are free of chauvinistic attitudes. Also recommended are more attention on the stress experienced by women living under a double standard and a more assertive role by women in community mental health boards and administrative positions.

914,"No authorship, i. (2006",The age of consent and the protection of females.,"This chapter is divided into four sections. Section 1: The Woman's Christian Temperance Union was instrumental in states' reforms of statutory rape laws at the end of the nineteenth century; most states raised the age of consent from 10 or 12 to 16 or 18. An example of such a petition is presented in this section. Section 2: Emily Blackwell was a leader in the campaign to reform statutory rape laws by raising the age of consent from 10-12 to 16-18. Here she reflects the popular narrative that there was a ""traffic in girls"" when she notes that poorer and working-class girls were most vulnerable to being taken advantage of, even being made unwilling prostitutes, when on their own in cities to work. She also draws attention to the ""double standard"" of morality by which women who had sex before marriage were viewed much more harshly than men who had engaged in the same activities. Section 3: Also known as the Mann Act, the White-Slave Traffic Act was passed in response to the United States having signed an international treaty to curb the ""social evil"" of prostitution. More broadly, it was also passed in response to a moral panic not only over young, working-class girls who were supposedly being forced into prostitution in U.S. cities, but also due to concern over a growing sexual independence among those same urban girls. As such, the Act was also used to punish consensual relationships between unmarried people. Since its passage in 1910, it has been amended--but never entirely repealed. Section 4: Statutory rape laws in the United States initially set the age of consent at 10 or 12. At the end of the nineteenth century, most states raised it to 16 or 18 due to strong lobbying efforts by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and others. Today, such laws are not uniform across the states--the states set different ages of consent, from 15 to 18; most require that the perpetrator be a certain number of years older than the victim, but some prosecute same-age perpetrators.

Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we analyze both qualitatively and quantitatively verbatim responses from 8177 respondents aged 16 and over concerning the (dis)advantages of their age. Two main questions are tested: 1) Is the cultural narrative of age decline supported by the experiences of our respondents? 2) Are age experiences differentiated by gender? We find people's age experiences are multidimensional and multidirectional, incorporating narratives of progress and decline. Our data show marked gender differences in age experiences, but give little support to claims of a double standard concerning the aging body. More generally, we find that people contrast current experiences with their younger and older selves. We argue that future conceptual developments need to take seriously both a synchronic and diachronic understanding of age, highlighting not just the present but also the distinctive historical development of individuals across time.

Parent-daughter communication (CM) was more wide-ranging than parent-son CM for each type of sexual discussion, and gender differences were most pronounced for factual and moral discussions, CM most likely to transmit information and values directly. Son-daughter variation was largely due to the greater role taken by the mother in family sex education. Focus group data suggest that sons may be more susceptible to cultural messages encouraging casual sexual encounters because lack of CM with parents has made them less certain of family norms for sexual behavior. Gender differences in family CM about sexuality may result from, and serve to perpetuate, a sexual double standard. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,916

(2015",Review of Sexual diversity and the 2014 Sochi Olympics: No more rainbows.,"Reviews the book, Sexual Diversity and the 2014 Sochi Olympics: No More Rainbows by Helen Jefferson Lenskyj (2014). This new monograph offers a look inside the making of the controversial 2014 Sochi Olympics with the legislative persecution of the Russian LGBT community in the background. It may be read as both an illustrative case study of Russia's treatment of non-heterosexual sexualities and a valid analysis of the global politics laying behind the Olympic movement's claimed commitment to diversity and equality. Lenskyj's main argument is that Putin's government and the IOC have a lot in common: both are corrupt, highly engaged in politics and frequently adhere to double standard policies. To prove the point, the author draws on a wide range of sources, from scholarly articles and monographs, including several of her own, to popular media and news reports. The book leaves an impression that the author was driven by her sympathy toward the Russian LGBT cause and an opportunity to use Sochi Olympics as a perfect evidence for her arguments-how heteronormativity is reinforced through international sports competitions and how the apolitical, peaceful, and pro-diversity statements of the Olympic movement are a myth, successfully used to cover what is ultimately a multi-billion-dollar industry.

(2016",Double RASS cutpoint accurately diagnosed suicidal risk in females with long-term conditions attending the emergency department compared to their male counterparts.,"Background: Suicidal risk is often unrecognized in emergency department (ED). We aimed to assess its prevalence in patients with long-term conditions (LTCs) attending an ED and to test whether gender differences influence suicidal risk assessment, using the diagnostic accuracy properties of the Risk Assessment Suicidality Scale (RASS). Methods: The RASS was administered to 349 patients with diabetes, COPD and rheumatic diseases visiting an ED. The MINI interview was used as the criterion standard. ROC curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal RASS cutpoint for suicidal risk separately for males and females. Somatic (PHQ-15) and depressive (PHQ-9) symptoms were also assessed and factors associated with suicidal risk across gender were determined in hierarchical regression models. Results: The prevalence of suicidal risk according to the MINI was 22.9%; 16.6% of patients were at low, 5.1% at moderate, and 0.9% at high risk. At an optimal cutpoint of 270, RASS had 81.3% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity. The optimal RASS cutpoint for females (340) was double the cutpoint for males (175). Somatic symptom burden was associated with suicidal risk in both sexes but it became non-significant after depressive symptoms were taken into account; suicidal risk was also associated with history of depression in females and lower income in males. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of suicidal risk in patients with LTCs attending the ED. As the optimal RASS cutpoint for females was double the cutpoint for males, clinicians should bear in mind gender differences when assessing for suicidal risk in the ED.

Methods: The framework was evaluated using data from 5321 children aged 12 to 17 years who were interviewed in a 2004 national survey in Zimbabwe. We constructed a measure of psychosocial distress using principle components analysis. We used regression analyses to obtain standardized parameter estimates of psychosocial distress and odds ratios of early sexual activity. Results: Orphans had more psychosocial distress than did nonorphans. For both genders, paternal, maternal, and double orphans exhibited more-severe distress than did nonorphaned, nonvulnerable children. Orphanhood remained associated with psychosocial distress after we controlled for differences in more-proximate determinants. Maternal and paternal orphans were significantly more likely than were nonorphaned, nonvulnerable children to have engaged in sexual activity. These differences were reduced after we controlled for psychosocial distress. Conclusions: Orphaned adolescents in Zimbabwe suffer greater psychosocial distress than do nonorphaned, nonvulnerable children, which may lead to increased likelihood of early onset of sexual intercourse and HIV infection. The effect of strategies to provide psychosocial support should be evaluated scientifically. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,919

The court concluded that there was probable cause to believe that Hendricks was a sexually violent predator and ordered him to be evaluated at a state hospital. The US Supreme Court reversed the Kansas Supreme Court's judgment, claiming the Act did not meet the threshold requirements of due process and did not transgress either double jeopardy or ex post facto protections. The expansion of the due process civil commitment standard from mental ""illness"" to mental ""abnormality"" occurred as a result of this case. The author advocates a criminal justice delivery system that views a sentence as a journey, retains detention, introduces intervention, and supports preemption.

921,"Oakes, E. T. (2013",,"The issue of relativism has long been a concern of Joseph Ratzinger, not only as a theologian, but also, most famously, as cardinal prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith and of course now as pope, feliciter regnans. But to understand why relativism has long worried him, we must first get some idea of what the term means and what its implications are, especially in regard to theological debate. As an initial foray into getting some clearer idea of this murky issue, let me begin with an anecdote, one to the best of my knowledge first recounted by James Luther Adams in his preface to Ernst Troeltsch's influential defense of a relativistic Christology called, aptly enough, The Absoluteness of Christianity. Here is Adams's anecdote: Sometime during the course of World War II the United States War Department brought together a selected group of cultural anthropologists in order to secure their counsel regarding the management of psychological warfare in [the] face of German National Socialism. After the group had assembled in Washington one of their number asked what the War Department really expected of these men. He explained that in his work the cultural anthropologist for the sake of scientific objectivity presupposes the point of view of cultural relativism, and that therefore he entertains no biases or ethical preferences, in short, that he is not accustomed to making value judgments regarding the various cultures he studies. He went on to say that if the Germans preferred Nazism, they were entitled to that preference, just as democratic Americans are entitled to their own different preference. In either case, he said, the preference is simply an expression of a cultural milieu.1 What the bureaucrats housed in the War Department thought of this weird objection to their postwar plans can only be imagined. But I cite the anecdote here for the anticipatory light it throws on Cardinal Ratzinger's famous expression, the ""dictatorship of relativism,"" which he voiced on the day before his election to the papacy and which made headlines throughout the world, not least because of the not unreasonable assumption that he was elected precisely because the cardinals in conclave agreed with him. Here is what he said on that occasion: How many winds of doctrine we have known in recent decades, how many ideological currents, how many ways of thinking? The small boat of thought of many Christians has often been tossed about by these waves, thrown from one extreme to the other: from Marxism to liberalism, even to libertinism; from collectivism to radical individualism; from atheism to a vague religious mysticism; from agnosticism to syncretism; and so forth. . . . Having a clear faith, based on the Creed of the Church, is often labeled today as fundamentalism. Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and ""swept along by every wind of teaching,"" looks like the only attitude (acceptable) to today's standards. We are moving toward a dictatorship of relativism, which does not recognize anything as certain and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires.2 At first glance, this expression ""dictatorship of relativism"" sounds like an oxymoron, even an unfair slur on relativists. For is it not their whole point that it is absolute claims that lead to dictatorship and that only relativism can preserve us from the totalitarian temptation? But of course, the value-neutrality of social scientists-so garishly on display in the Adams anecdote-shows that in fact relativism is singularly ill equipped to meet the challenge of aggressive totalitarianism when it becomes an active force in history. The ""dictatorship of relativism,"" however, means more than just collusion with the world's real dictatorships. It also has a deeper- even paradoxical-meaning, one that I can illustrate in many flashpoints in the culture wars: the fact that there are no true relativists across the board. Closet absolutism always lurks in relativistic rhetoric, which can be seen in any number of examples, not least Cardinal Ratzinger's last line that relativists nowadays recognize only their own ego and its desires as its highest goal, an absolute claim if there ever was one. Other examples come readily to mind. In his famous book The Closing of the American Mind, Allan Bloom recommends asking students in a typical undergraduate classroom what the British should have done during the days of the Raj in India about the practice of suttee, the tradition observed in some Hindu villages of the widow throwing herself on her husband's funeral pyre as a sign of her total identification with him. To the typical relativist, the British should never have been in India in the first place, imposing their values hegemonically on a traditional society, which was only minding its own business. But to countenance the practice would validate the subjugation of women. Then there is the issue of pornography, described by Bloom as, in fact, a clash of absolutes: The sexual revolution marched under the banner of freedom; feminism under that of equality. Although they went arm in arm for a while, their differences eventually put them at odds with each other, as Tocqueville said freedom and equality would always be. This is manifest in the squabble over pornography, which pits liberated sexual desire against feminist resentment about stereotyping. We are presented with the amusing spectacle of pornography clad in the armor borrowed from the heroic struggle for freedom of speech, and using Miltonic rhetoric, doing battle with feminism, newly draped in the robes of community morality, using arguments associated with conservatives who defend traditional sex roles, and also defying an authoritarian tradition in which it was taboo to suggest any relation between what a person reads and sees and his sexual practices. In the background stand the liberals, wringing their hands in confusion because they wish to favor both sides and cannot.3 A similar dynamic can be seen to be at work in the controversy over adoptions by gay couples. In spring 2007 Britain's Parliament passed a law requiring all adoption agencies, including Catholic ones, to allow gay couples to adopt children placed in the care of these agencies. Now at first glance it would seem that a true relativist would treat Catholics like exotic Amazonians: sure, they have odd views about the family, whereby only a married husband and wife are the sole legitimate and appropriate couple suited for raising a child, natural or adopted. How weird those Catholics are, but who are we to judge? Secularists of course disagree and see no problem with the idea that, as the textbook for grade-schoolers has it, ""Heather has two mommies."" But what does that have to do with Catholics? After all, anthropologists recognize that different societies are marked by different kinship relations: they freely, and nonjudgmentally, discuss matriarchal societies in prehistory, polygamy in seventh-century Arabia and in nineteenth-century Utah, gay ""marriage"" in Massachusetts and Holland in contemporary society, and so on, all without judgmental ism or moralism. So why not let Catholics live out their peculiar lifestyle too? But that's not happening, and the question is why. Hypocrisy surely has something to do with it, although I think the real reason stems from the odd admixture of absolutism and relativism in selfprofessed relativists. Probably we are all a swirling amalgamation of relativism and absolutism. No relativist, I assume, would defend the right of widows to immolate themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres in present-day, noncolonial India (where suttee is now illegal although still practiced occasionally in out-of-the-way villages); and no self-professed absolutist or deontologist would insist everyone must like opera. So maybe ""we are all absolutists now,"" even though we are also simultaneously ""all multiculturalists too"" (to borrow a phrase from Nathan Glazer's famous book by that title). Thus we get the paradox of the liberal credo, which Bloom summarizes this way: ""There are no absolutes; freedom is absolute.""4 Again, as e saw with the anecdote from Adams, this credo doubles back on itself and leaves the path open to a very real dictatorship, as Bloom notes here: The progressives of the twenties and thirties did not like the Constitutional protection of private property or the restraints on majority will and on living as one pleased. For them, equality had not gone far enough. Stalinists also found the definition of democracy as openness useful. The Constitution clashed too violently with the theory and practice of the Soviet Union. But if democracy means open-mindedness, and respect for other cultures prevents doctrinaire, natural-rights-based condemnation of the Soviet reality, then someday their ways may become ours. I remember a grade-school history textbook, newly printed on fine glossy paper, showing intriguing pictures of collective farms where farmers worked and lived together without the profit motive. (Children cannot understand the issues, but they are easy to propagandize.) This was very different from our way of life, [these textbooks implied,] but we were not to be closed to it, to react to it merely on the basis of our cultural prejudices.5 So the confusions left in the wake of relativism, which are of such concern to Pope Benedict, run deep and in fact have a genealogy that can be delineated.

922,"Obure, C. D., et al. (2016",Does integration of HIV and sexual and reproductive health services improve technical efficiency in Kenya and Swaziland? An application of a two-stage semi parametric approach incorporating quality measures.,"Theoretically, integration of vertically organized services is seen as an important approach to improving the efficiency of health service delivery. However, there is a dearth of evidence on the effect of integration on the technical efficiency of health service delivery. Furthermore, where technical efficiency has been assessed, there have been few attempts to incorporate quality measures within efficiency measurement models particularly in sub-Saharan African settings. This paper investigates the technical efficiency and the determinants of technical efficiency of integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services using data collected from 40 health facilities in Kenya and Swaziland for 2008/2009 and 2010/2011. Incorporating a measure of quality, we estimate the technical efficiency of health facilities and explore the effect of integration and other environmental factors on technical efficiency using a two-stage semi-parametric double bootstrap approach. The empirical results reveal a high degree of inefficiency in the health facilities studied. The mean bias corrected technical efficiency scores taking quality into consideration varied between 22% and 65% depending on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model specification. The number of additional HIV services in the maternal and child health unit, public ownership and facility type, have a positive and significant effect on technical efficiency. However, number of additional HIV and STI services provided in the same clinical room, proportion of clinical staff to overall staff, proportion of HIV services provided, and rural location had a negative and significant effect on technical efficiency. The low estimates of technical efficiency and mixed effects of the measures of integration on efficiency challenge the notion that integration of HIV and SRH services may substantially improve the technical efficiency of health facilities. The analysis of quality and efficiency as separate dimensions of performance suggest that efficiency may be achieved without sacrificing quality. Â© 2016 The Authors.",0,922

(2005",Sexual behaviour of Nigerian university students.,"Objective - The objective of this study was to document selected aspects of the sexuality of Nigerian university students, specifically sexual behaviour, attitudes about sexuality, the circumstances of sexual intercourse and preventive sexual behaviour. Method - A total of 1 153 students at two federal universities in Nigeria completed a self administered questionnaire. Results - The mean age of first intercourse was 17.0 years for males and 19.1 years for females. Male students were more likely to have had sex and to engage in unsafe sex. There were no obvious differences between the genders in the numbers of same-sex partners. Levels of sexual activity were high. For example, 53.8% had experienced intercourse, and 24.4% reported more than one regular sex partner. Male students displayed more permissive attitudes than female students. A minority reported having the same sexual attitudes as their parents or friends, and discussing their sex lives with their parents. A substantial proportion of the students believed that if you loved a partner you could not ask him/her to use condom while having sex. Condoms were the most commonly reported preventive method that was used. The majority of both male and female students reported that they 'always' or 'often' used protection when having sex. Conclusions - There is a need to begin to address emerging reproductive health issues in Nigerian tertiary institutions. Data regarding attitudes about sexuality and circumstances of intercourse can inform the content of intervention programmes. Copyright Â© NISC Pty Ltd.",0,923

(2017","Premarital birth, children’s sex composition and marital instability among women in sub-Saharan Africa.","Anecdotal evidence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) suggests that it is unlikely for marriages with children to break up, especially when the children are male. To provide new empirical evidence, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of premarital birth and sex composition of children on marital instability (divorce or separation) among ever-married women in SSA. Data from a weighted sample of 205,997 women from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 26 sub-Saharan African countries between 2011 and 2014 were analysed. Stratified by sub-region, analysis involved the use of descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression models with robust standard errors. Parity-specific logistic regression models were fitted to investigate the association between sex composition and marital instability at parities 1, 2, 3 and 4+. The percentage of women with experience of marital instability in the four sub-regions was: Western (4.6%), Central (12.0%), Eastern (10.5%) and Southern Africa (11.4%). Premarital birth was significantly associated with marital instability in Western (OR = 1.52, p < 0.05), Central (OR = 1.22, p < 0.05), Eastern (OR = 1.39, p < 0.05) and Southern Africa (OR = 1.25, p < 0.05). In Western Africa, at parities 1â2, women with female children were significantly more likely to be divorced or separated. At parities 3 and above, there was no significant difference in the odds of marital instability between women with majority male and those with majority female children. This study extends current knowledge about family dynamics by providing a wider view on the relationship between premarital birth, childrenâs sex composition and marital instability in the four sub-regions of sub-Saharan Africa.

925,"Ogbu, M. A. (1996",Girl to woman in a changing African society: The impact of modernization and development on sexual socialization of adolescents.,"The study examined the impact of social change on adolescent sexual socialization, the nature and sources of these changes, their implications for adolescent sexual behavior and the role of mothers in contemporary adolescent sexual socialization. The study was conducted in Nigeria among Afikpo Ibos, a double-descent group. Research methods included focus group interviews, formal and informal individual interviews, observations and a survey of 400 adolescent girls. Afikpo society is undergoing dramatic changes, due to increased and prolonged female schooling, the media, the church and exposure to Western goods and consumption patterns. These institutions altered the preparation of girls for womanhood. Thus, girls are no longer prepared primarily to become wives and mothers. Instead, they are also prepared to become civil servants and business women in the modern sector. The time and place (schooling) of their preparation for their new roles have also contributed to render the traditional rites of passage obsolete. No new mechanism has yet emerged to replace the traditional system of socially managing and transmitting sexual knowledge, norms and attitudes. Consequently, adolescent girls are at a great risk of premarital sexual activity, pregnancy and abortions. The study found that sexual socialization has shifted to Afikpo mothers who are unprepared to assume the responsibility. In traditional Afikpo culture mothers were not responsible and did not function as the principal agents of sexual socialization. Hence, with the shift of responsibility they are unable to function as agents of sexual socialization. Traditionally, sexual socialization was managed through socially orchestrated rituals, such as initiation. The traditional rites of passage symbolically transmitted community attitudes and standards about sexual norms and behaviors, although the latter were not explicitly taught.

(2015",Tract-based spatial statistics to assess the neuroprotective effect of early erythropoietin on white matter development in preterm infants.,"Despite improved survival, many preterm infants undergo subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment. To date, no neuroprotective therapies have been implemented into clinical practice. Erythropoietin, a haematopoietic cytokine used for treatment of anaemia of prematurity, has been shown to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects on the brain in many experimental studies. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin on the microstructural development of the cerebral white matter using tract-based spatial statistics performed at term equivalent age. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, prospective multicentre study applying recombinant human erythropoietin in the first 42 h after preterm birth entitled 'Does erythropoietin improve outcome in preterm infant' was conducted in Switzerland (NCT00413946). Preterm infants were given recombinant human erythropoietin (3000 IU) or an equivalent volume of placebo (NaCl 0.9%) intravenously before 3 h of age after birth, at 12-18 h and at 36-42 h after birth. High resolution diffusion tensor imaging was obtained at 3 T in 58 preterm infants with mean (standard deviation) gestational age at birth 29.75 (1.44) weeks, and at scanning at 41.1 (2.09) weeks. Imaging was performed at a single centre. Voxel-wise statistical analysis of the fractional anisotropy data was carried out using tract-based spatial statistics to test for differences in fractional anisotropy between infants treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and placebo using a general linear model, covarying for the gestational age at birth and the corrected gestational age at the time of the scan. Preterm infants treated with recombinant human erythropoietin demonstrated increased fractional anisotropy in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the corticospinal tract bilaterally. Mean fractional anisotropy was significantly higher in preterm infants treated with recombinant human erythropoietin than in those treated with placebo (P < 0.001). We conclude that early recombinant human erythropoietin administration improves white matter development in preterm infants assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics.

(2013",Nicotine interactions with low-dose alcohol: Pharmacological influences on smoking and drinking motivation.,"An extensive literature documents a close association between cigarette and alcohol use. The joint pharmacological effects of alcohol and nicotine on smoking and drinking motivation may help explain this relationship. This experiment was designed to test the separate and combined pharmacological effects of nicotine and a low dose of alcohol (equivalent to 1-2 standard drinks) on substance use motivation using a double-blind and fully crossed within-subjects design. Participants (N = 87) with a wide range of smoking and drinking patterns completed 4 counterbalanced experimental sessions during which they consumed an alcohol (male: 0.3g/kg; female: 0.27g/kg) or placebo beverage and smoked a nicotine (.6 mg) or placebo cigarette. Outcome measures assessed the impact of drug administration (alcohol or nicotine) on craving to smoke, craving to drink, affect, and liking of the beverage and cigarette. Results indicated that combined administration produced higher cravings to smoke for the entire sample, as well as higher cravings to drink among women and lighter drinkers. Heavier users of either alcohol or cigarettes also exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the effects of either drug in isolation. Separate, but not interactive, effects of alcohol and nicotine on mood were observed as well as both same-drug and cross-drug effects on beverage and cigarette liking. Together, these findings support the notion that the interactive pharmacological effects of nicotine and low doses of alcohol play an important role in motivating contemporaneous use and suggest roles for cross-reinforcement and cross-tolerance in the development and maintenance of alcohol and nicotine use and dependence.

Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetic profile and its pattern of side effects may hinder a rapid dose escalation, a therapeutic strategy that might be utterly desirable in patients with OCD. In preclinical studies, the maximum plasma concentration and bioavailability of an extended-release (CR) formulation of fluvoxamine were, respectively, 38% and 16% lower than those of the standard (ie, non-CR) formulation. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the fluvoxamine CR formulation for the treatment of OCD in adults. This approval was based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 253 OCD patients in which fluvoxamine CR showed a consistently earlier onset of therapeutic effects than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as reported in previous studies. The use of the CR formulation of fluvoxamine allowed a particularly aggressive dosing strategy at the beginning of the titration phase, ie, treatment could be started with a single dose of fluvoxamine CR 100 mg at bedtime, while keeping the occurrence of side effects and the rate of compliance at levels comparable to those reported for the use of immediate-release fluvoxamine.

Data from the European Social Survey are used to map where there is a strong degree of resonance or dissonance between societal and individual attitudes and how these are attenuated by sex and employment status. The results expose unexpected national and intra-national similarities and differences. Societies characterized by a traditional male breadwinner model, such as Spain, indicate a higher degree of permissive values than expected; more liberal countries like the UK show high degrees of indifference, as well as a strong element of traditionalism.

The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of the practice of defensive medicine in the UK among hospital doctors and the factors affecting it. Methods. A quantitative study was designed, with a detailed seventeen point questionnaire. Defensive medicine practice was assessed and tested against four factors age, gender, specialty and grade. Three hundred hospital doctors from three UK hospitals received the questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and four (68%) out of 300 hospital doctors responded to the survey. Seventy eight percent reported practicing one form or another of defensive medicine. Ordering unnecessary tests is the commonest form of defensive medicine reported by 59% of the respondents. This is followed by unnecessary referral to other specialties (55%). While only 9% of the sampled doctors would refuse to treat high risk patients, double this number would avoid high risks procedures all together (21%). A linear regression module has shown that only senior grade was associated with less practice of defensive medicine. Conclusion: Defensive medical practice is common among the doctors who responded to the survey. Senior grade is associated with less practice of defensive medicine.

This consisted of a random sample of 80 subjects (40 boys and 40 girls) in each of the 14-15, 16-17, and 18-19 years age groups. Thus, there were 6 data groups. Boys and girls differed significantly in their kissing, breast/genital, fondling, embracing, holding hands, and sexual intercourse behavior. More boys than girls were found to have engaged in kissing (80% versus 53.3%), breast/genital fondling (73.3% versus 49.2%), embracing (83.3% versus 56.7%), holding hands (86.7% versus 67.5%), and sexual intercourse (68.3% versus 42.5%). Boys showed more internal variation than girls, differing in 4 of the activities, while girls differed in 3 activities. There was a significant difference among boys when the 3 age groups were compared with respect to kissing, embracing, hold hands, and sexual intercourse. Boys did not differ significantly in their breast/genital fondling behavior. Girls showed significant differences in their kissing, breast/genital fondling, and sexual intercourse behavior. Their seeming difference in embracing and holding hands behavior did not reach statitical significance. The findings show that various forms of sexual activities are widely practiced by Nigerian adolescents. Among boys and girls there are considerable differences in sexual behavior due to age. The study fails to confirm the assumption that as a result of social and cultural sanctions the sexual standards of Nigerian adolescents would be less radical than those of their Western counterparts. Nigerian adolescents are absorbing foreign cultures quickly and no longer adhere to local cultural regulations regarding sex. Added to this is the sexual content of movies and magazines and the use of sex in advertising. The wide gap between the male and female adolescents in their sexual behavior is an indication that the double standard persists in Nigeria. Sex education has not been promoted well in Nigeria, therefore it is necessary that sex education be introduced immediately in order to deal with the rapidly changing sex values of youth.",0,936

938,"Palmer, A. C. (2012",Early life nutritional exposures and long-term programming of the immune system.,"Background. Maternal undernutrition is a major public health problem in the developing world. A growing body of evidence attests to the impact of maternal undernutrition on the emerging organ systems of the fetus, with functional alterations persisting throughout life. Research regarding nutritional programming of the immune system is limited to date. This study explores relationships between early life nutrition, including randomized exposure to maternal vitamin A or beta-carotene supplementation, on three vulnerable aspects of immune development: early lymphopoiesis, thymic organogenesis, and inflammatory mechanisms. Methods. A double-blind, cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin A or beta-carotene supplementation (7,000 micro g retinol equivalents) was conducted in the Sarlahi district of Nepal from 1994-1997. Field workers collected extensive data on maternal and infant health, nutritional status, and environmental exposures at multiple time points in pregnancy and the first half of infancy. From 2006-2008, we contacted participants of this trial and their children, aged 9-13 years, to assess current health and nutritional status. Using commercial immunoassays, we measured children's plasma concentrations of natural antibodies (NAb) as a marker for early B1a cells, thymulin as a marker for thymic size, and interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) as indicators of inflammation. Results. Geometric mean (95% confidence interval) immune protein concentrations of sampled children were as follows: 18.36 U/mL (17.01, 19.81) for NAb; 1.37 ng/mL (1.27, 1.47) for thymulin; 1.66 pg/mL (1.51, 1.82) for IL-6; 0.24 mg/L (0.20, 0.29) for CRP; and 0.84 mg/mL (0.81, 0.86) for AGP. Girls had significantly higher NAb levels (p<0.001); NAb concentrations were also significantly associated (p<0.05) with ear discharge and symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract infection. Plasma thymulin was most strongly associated with nutritional status variables and season of interview. IL-6, CRP and AGP concentrations were reliably higher among children who were sick in the previous week, compared to those with no reported morbidity symptoms. We observed consistent U-shaped relationships between measures of body fat and inflammatory proteins. Maternal vitamin A supplementation increased NAb concentrations by 0.39 standard deviations compared to the placebo (p<0.05). NAb levels in boys were strongly associated with neonatal size, growth from 0-3 months, and size at 3 months of age. Girls born during the harvest season had higher NAb levels than their peers (p=0.07). Thymulin concentrations did not differ by maternal supplementation group, but were directly associated with weight (p<0.01) and length gains (p<0.05) from 0-3 months in both sexes. Levels of inflammatory proteins tended to be highest in children (particularly girls) born to beta-carotene supplemented mothers. Maternal wasting (arm circumference <21.5 cm) and, in boys, neonatal size were also associated with higher concentrations of inflammatory proteins. We found no evidence of a link between infant feeding practices and any of the measured immune proteins. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that early life nutritional insults may have a lasting impact on the emerging immune system. Perturbations to the immune system, particularly the processes by which immune reactions are regulated, may have immediate consequences for infant health and survival, as well as longer term implications for the development of immune-mediated and/or inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.

This study explored the relationships among cognitive functioning, clinical symptoms, overall functionality, and demographic characteristics. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a 52-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind study (N=323) comparing 2 doses of risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) in stable subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Cognitive evaluations were performed and standardized using a healthy age- and sex-matched comparison group. Simple and multiple regression models were used to identify relationships among neurocognitive composite scores (NCS), clinical symptom end points (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] total and factor scores), overall functionality (Personal and Social Performance [PSP] score), and demographics. Results: A simple regression model identified significant relationships between the NCS at end point and PANSS total score, PANSS disorganized thoughts factor score, functioning (PSP) and age. A 1-point decrease on PANSS total score and PANSS disorganized thoughts factor score corresponded to an increase in NCS of 0.126-point, and 0.81-point increases, respectively. A 1-point increase on the PSP corresponded to a 0.186-point increase in the NCS T-score. Among the demographic variables, only age correlated significantly with cognition (10-year increase in age corresponded to 1.1-point decrease in NCS T-score) in a multiple regression model. Conclusion: Improved cognition was associated with beneficial changes in functional status and clinical symptoms (particularly disorganization symptoms) in subjects with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. Older subjects showed less overall cognitive improvement. Improved cognitive and functional outcome is correlated with symptom improvements in RLAI-treated patients with schizophrenia.

Every group suggested that women who dress in a sexually provocative manner or get drunk are more likely to be perceived as ""loose"" or sexually ""easy"" by men in general. These findings are consistent with stereotypes of women drinkers as sexually promiscuous and are seen to highlight the societal double standards for men and women who drink. The men described a woman calling attention to herself, being alone, out late, or having contact with many men in the bar as vulnerable. These findings are similar to those found during focus group discussions with women bar drinkers (K. A. Parks et al, 1998). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,942

Siegert (1993",Adults' conceptions of everyday memory failures in others: Factors that mediate the effects of target age.,"Investigated young and older adults' conceptions of memory failures in others. 100 young and 100 older adults rated memory failures in targets of 20, 40, 60, and 80 yrs of age as to how likely the memory failures were due to lack of effort or lack of ability. With increasing age, targets' forgetful episodes were rated as less likely to be caused by lack of effort and more likely to be due to lack of ability. A Subject Age x Target Age interaction on ability ratings showed age to be more salient for older Ss. Memory content, type of memory, S sex, and target sex all influenced judgment of memory failure. The results support J. T. Erber's (1989) notion of a double standard in memory-failure appraisal; they demonstrated that adults' conceptions of memory include a decremental view of memorial ability with increasing age that is differentially sensitive to S, target, and memorial variables.

Results: Although most (80.5%) of the 4,019 participants had at least contemplated HPV vaccination, more females had taken observable steps towards vaccination. Significant differences between genders in HPV-related beliefs and attitudes were observed, particularly perceived parental or perceived health care provider approval of HPV vaccination. Conclusions: University students generally agreed with the benefits of HPV vaccination, both for themselves and for society, and these attitudes were significantly associated with having at least contemplated vaccination.

Morgan-Lopez (2007","College Drinking Behaviors: Mediational Links Between Parenting Styles, Parental Bonds, Depression, and Alcohol Problems.","Mediational links between parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), parental bond (positive, negative), depression, alcohol use and abuse were tested. A 2-group, multiple-indicator, multiple-cause structural equation model with 441 (216 female, 225 male) college students was examined. In general, a poor parental bond with one's father was highly predictive of depression, a well-known predictor of alcohol abuse and related problems for both genders. In contrast, a positive parental bond with one's father significantly mediated the positive effects of authoritative fathering on depression, which then decreased alcohol use problems for both genders. For women, a negative parental bond with one's father significantly mediated the effect of having an authoritarian father on depression, which increased alcohol use problems. These findings suggest that parental influences on pathways to alcohol abuse through depression (primarily through fathers for both genders) are distinct from pathways stemming from poor impulse control (with influences primarily from the same-sex parents for both genders).

Leaper (2016",Heterosexual dating double standards in undergraduate women and men.,"Traditional heterosexual dating and courtship scripts (e.g., men pay for date, women take partner's last name in marriage) reflect different standards of desirable behavior for women and men. Analogous to sexual double standards, dating double standards reflect the greater agency and power traditionally accorded to men in society. In the present study, we investigated factors related to young heterosexual adults' endorsement of dating double standards. Participants were 330 female and male U.S. undergraduates at a California public university (57 % female, ages 18-25 years-old) from diverse ethnic backgrounds. In the Heterosexual Dating Double-Standards Scale, respondents rate the desirability of five dating and courtship behaviors (initiate date, hold door open, pay for date, propose marriage, take spouse's last name) separately for women and men. Preliminary analyses revealed participants generally expressed double standards by rating the desirability of behaviors differently for female and male characters in the traditional direction (e.g., paying for a date rated more desirable for a man than for a woman). We predicted dating double standards would be positively related to factors previously found to predict traditional gender roles (viewing popular media, religious attendance) as well as attitudes that reflect traditional views (conservative political beliefs, benevolent and hostile sexism, disavowing a feminist identity). These hypotheses were generally supported. Among these correlations, dating double standards were strongly associated with benevolent sexism (among women and men) and with hostile sexism (among men). Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,946
947,"Peacock, M. (2003",The myth of Pandora and the repression of women's appetites (Hesiod).,"Jungian analyst Polly Young-Eisendrath describes the mythological character of Pandora as an object of male desire. She sees her as a representation of a woman who denies her own needs in order to comply with the demands and desires of others. But why did the archaic poet, Hesiod, find it necessary to create the first woman-a new woman, really-in the first place? What possible influence did the creation of Pandora have upon the people of the archaic and classical eras? How can the myth of Pandora be understood as a metaphor for psychological growth? And if mythemes of the myth are alive within the contemporary society, where are they found? The answers to these questions comprise the bulk of this dissertation by examining the myth of the first woman from various points of entry and using a variety of lenses, including anthropology, history, literature, depth psychology, and sociology, in an attempt to deepen the investigation of the first woman of ancient Greece. Double entendres pervade the myth of Pandora, creating an intricate web of meaning that reveals a society in disarray. Hesiod writes at a time when the earth cannot sustain the ever-expanding Greek population and human survival is at risk. Pandora, the most beautiful and sexually tempting woman ever created, symbolizes what men must avoid in order to quell the social upheaval: women. In other words, the myth of Pandora acts as a rudimentary form of birth control, fashioning women in an evil light and shaming their appetites for food and sex. The influence of Hesiod's myth trickles down into the classical era. Even today, mythemes of the myth hide in social customs as evidenced by the certain double standards for adolescent girls and conflicting messages of sexuality sent to young women by authority figures and the media. These inconsistencies create a difficult and confusing transition for many adolescents, often manifesting as an obsession with body weight and low self-esteem. The myth of Pandora closes with hope clinging to the rim of the jar from which the evils escaped. By expanding and re-imagining the story metaphorically, genuine ways to transform the repression of women's appetites can be found, releasing hope for the future and bringing women and men into closer alliance.

948,"Peano, I. (2012","Excesses and double standards: Migrant prostitutes, sovereignty and exceptions in contemporary Italy.","In this paper, the author proposes an analysis of the apparently contradictory attitudes towards transactional sexual exchanges, as they have emerged in public debate and informed legislation and policies in Italy over the past few years. The ambiguity towards commercial sex is linked to a specific dynamic of power, which denies sexual labour the status of work and makes it the object of repressive and criminalising policies, whilst at the same time habitually demanding sexual services in exchange for money, gifts or favours. The article shows how criminalisation functions as a prominent form for the control of subjects, related to the workings of sovereignty. In particular, the author considers the ways in which the criminalisation of prostitution and of undocumented migration, which compound in the figure of the migrant prostitute, represents a means for the exertion of sovereignty and relates to the centrality of desire, transgression and their disciplining in the contemporary context. However, closer examination of the subjective experiences of those who are supposedly excluded and criminalised, such as undocumented migrant sex workers in detention centres, reveals the incompleteness of disciplinary mechanisms.

949,"Pechansky, F. (1998","Patterns of alcohol use among adolescents living in Porto Alegre, Brazil.","A cross-sectional household survey was used to assess patterns of alcohol experimentation and consumption among Brazilian adolescents, stratified by age and sex. Trained interviewers administered a standardized questionnaire to 950 Ss, aged 10-18 yrs, which examined such things as age of first alcohol use, situational aspects of consumption, amounts ingested and use among peers. Lifetime prevalence of alcohol use was high (71.5%), especially in the older teens (94.4%). The mean age of first use was 10 yrs, and consumption of all types of alcohol, including hard liquor, was common. Alcohol use typically began in the home, at family celebrations and social occasions, and progressively evolved to street drinking with peers. This pattern was most evident in males, who reported a larger volume of alcohol consumption per episode, when compared with females. The total amount of alcohol consumption reported for all ages is very high and may be due to permissive cultural views of alcohol. Age and gender play an important role in the evolution of drinking, with male adolescents being exposed to higher concentrations of alcohol and at younger ages than females, who seem to have a more conservative attitude toward excessive drinking. Ss considered these practices normal, with no concern about the illegality of such behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,949

Johnson (2014",Electile dysfunction.,"This essay combines Burke's burlesque frame and Jamieson's double binds to create a hybrid gendered theory for rhetorically analyzing the aggressive sexualization of 2008 United States vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The essay develops our theory titled the ""burlesque binds"" and explicates a specific form of a burlesque bind: the ""MILF frame."" Palin's aggressively sexualized representation was united under the crass acronym MILF, which stands for ""Mom I'd Like to Fuck."" The MILF frame emphasized Palin's feminine qualities, positioning her as a ""trophy vice"" with no political acumen, and highlighted her masculine behaviors, but deflated them through sexual objectification. The unification of the binds and burlesque theories reveals how Palin's role as a social actor was not simply circumscribed but shut down: she was deemed unfit by both masculine and feminine standards, by both public and private sphere conventions. Although Sarah Palin has arguably been the most prevalent subject of the political MILF frame, our essay catalogues other instances of female political leaders experiencing this type of symbolic degradation, suggesting the MILF frame's vast influence.

Data were collected via self-administered questionnaires from over 1,100 English-speaking respondents in 4 countries-US, Malaya, Bangladesh, and Canada. The cultural contexts had a strong effect on the attitudes and behavior of individual Ss. As predicted, the difference in the standards held by males and females was small in highly permissive societies. Negative consequences of premarital intercourse (i.e., guilt) were reported by the highest proportion of sexually experienced Ss in the most restrictive society. Across all cultures, greater courtship participation, less religiosity, greater physical attractiveness, and spending less time with one's family were associated with greater permissiveness. Ss from high-status backgrounds were generally more permissive. (14 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,952

Clinical symptomatology was measured by standardized psychometric scales. 19 age and sex-matched healthy controls underwent SPU. Body sway velocity and length were significantly higher in panic Ss than in controls and Ss showed high percentages of abnormal scores. Ss with 2 or more abnormal scores on SPU were significantly more agoraphobic than those with less than 2. Abnormal SPU scores under the eyes-opened was related to high anticipatory anxiety, whereas those under eyes-closed (EC) was related to phobic avoidance. Symptomatological reactivity to CO2 was significantly correlated to abnormal functions of the BAL SYS in the EC condition. The findings suggest that (1) Ss with PD have abnormalities in their BAL SYS function compared with healthy controls, (2) symptomatological reactivity to CO2 and BAL SYS function in Ss with PD are correlated only in the EC condition and (3) there is a significant link between agoraphobic avoidance and subclinical abnormal function of the BAL SYS network.

954,"Pestrak, V. A. and D. Martin (1985",Cognitive development and aspects of adolescent sexuality.,"Difficulty with adjustment to sexuality by adolescents has been of increasing concern to both educators and human service professionals in recent years. The cognitive development and behavior of adolescents as it pertains to sexuality and the implications for helping them overcome maladaptive sexual behavior is discussed. This paper proposes that even if early sexual activity is socially acceptable, and although young adolescents may be biologically capable of coitus, they have not reached the level of cognitive development to develop genuine intimacy, understand the complex, interpersonal aspects of a mature sexual relationship, and properly practice birth control. Elkind refers to adolescent egocentrism with 2 modes of thinking: 1) the imaginary audience and 2) the personal fable. The imaginary audience involves asolescents' anticipation of other people's reactions to themselves, while the personal fable refers to the adolescents' belief that they are special and unique. Evidence suggests that these modes of thinking play a part in many teenagers' decisions not to use contraceptives. While it is commonly believed that sex education leads to proper use of contraceptives, some studies contradict this view. Manaster suggests that due to the high level of cognitive sophistication necessary to function at the permissiveness with affection standard, many adolescents will be unable to adopt this standard. Still, many adolescents believe that they are operating according to this sexual standard. Although adolescents are experiencing the onset of puberty earlier, they are not developing at a faster rate cognitively. Different forms of birth control demand 1) acceptance of one's sexuality ,2) acknowledgement that one is sexually active, 3) anticipation in the present, and 4) the ability to view potential future sexual encounters realistically. Excluding sterility, the only contraceptive device that does not make these demands is the IUD.",0,954
955,"Peters, M. (2005",Sex differences and the factor of time in solving Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotation problems.,"In accounting for the well-established sex differences on mental rotation tasks that involve cube stimuli of the Shepard and Metzler (Shepard & Metzler, 1971) kind, performance factors are frequently invoked. Three studies are presented that examine performance factors. In Study 1, analyses of the performance of a large number of subjects (n = 1765) that performed the Vandenberg and Kuse (1976) mental rotation test (MRT) under standard conditions showed that the magnitude of the sex differences increases as subjects proceed through the sequence of problems, and that fewer females than males reach the last problems in a problem set. This supports the role of time constraints in sex differences on the MRT. Study 2 compared the magnitude of sex differences for subjects (n = 212) who did the MRT under standard conditions (T1), and with double the time (T2) allowed for the test. No significant reduction in the magnitude of sex differences was observed--even though the overall scores under T2 increased markedly for both sexes. Study 3 examined the suggestion by Kerkman, Wise, and Harwood (2000) that mental rotation differences arise because females spend more time than males in assuring that stimuli that do not match do indeed not match, with no sex differences for matching stimuli. This hypothesis was not supported for a sample of 20 males and 26 females. We conclude that performance factors may play a role in sex difference on mental rotation tasks, but do not account for all of the differences.

Factors investigated include (a) lack of a sense of moral trespass (including the double standard, perception of the pair relationship, and contextual moral meanings), (b) visibility, and (c) social distance. The apparent inconsistency between culpability of behavior and absence of labeling is reconciled by consideration of the ""morality of consequences"" and the ""morality of intentions.""

This approach was tentatively recommended by Murray et al. (Bull.

The operationalization of the VEI approach used in this paper was suggested by Nord (Summary Measures of Population Health: Concepts, Ethics, Measurement and Applications, WHO, 2002.). We test if VEI and person trade-off (PTO) methods generate similar quality-of-life weights. In addition, we compare VEI and PTO weights with individual utilities estimated by means of the conventional standard gamble (SG) and a variation of it we call double gamble. Finally, psychometric properties like feasibility, reliability, and consistency are examined. Our main findings are next: (1) VEI and PTO approaches generate very different weights; (2) it seems that differences between PTO and VEI are not due to the 'rule of rescue'; (3) the VEI resembled more a DG than a classical SG; (4) PTO, VEI, and DG exhibited good feasibility, reliability and consistency.

(2008",Bachelors and bunnies: ,"This dissertation explores the ways in which Playboy magazine confronted-and contributed to-changing notions of gender and heterosexuality in the postwar years. This work reconsiders Playboy 's treatment of womanhood, feminism, monogamy and romance, and its idealization of straight masculinity through consumerism. While acknowledging the traditional feminist critique of the magazine, this dissertation argues that Playboy also served as a progressive vehicle for the re-negotiation of gender and sexuality amidst an era of tumultuous change. This work presents new material drawn from unprecedented access to the Playboy company archives, as well as oral histories conducted with Hugh Hefner, top Playboy editors and former Playmates. Bachelors and Bunnies directly confronts the most blatantly sexist elements of the magazine, demonstrating that if one finds fault with Playboy's treatment of women, it should primarily be for some of its early text, rather than for its centerfolds. But in contrast, this work also shows that Playboy revealed a competing sexual morality system in its readers' letter columns, which promoted a consistently compassionate and equitable view of relationships, and insisted upon tolerance for difference-including homosexuality-and a rejection of the double standard. Beyond romance, this dissertation demonstrates that consumerism was crucial to Playboy 's construction of ideal masculinity. From its first issues, Playboy acted as a lifestyle guide for the modern male, focusing on fashion, cooking and decorating. To compliment the consuming bachelor, the centerfold Playmates, portrayed as average, all-American girls who enjoyed their sexuality, challenged the Madonna/whore dichotomy that reigned in American popular culture and thus expanded upon notions of acceptable female sexuality. Finally, Bachelors and Bunnies explores Hefner's relationship to the feminist movement of the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, and ultimately expands our understanding of pop culture and sexuality in the postwar years.

(1995","Self-presentation by men to attractive and unattractive women: Tactics of ingratiation, blasting and basking.","Physical attractiveness plays a more important role in partner selections for men than it does for women (Feingold, 1992, 1993). Being associated with attractive members of the opposite gender appears to benefit men more so than women (Bar-tal & Saxe, 1976). Both men and women tend to attribute socially desirable characteristics to men who are associated with attractive women and socially penalize men associated with unattractive women (Bar-tal & Saxe, 1976; Sigall & Landy, 1973). The impact of a woman's attractiveness should not be underestimated when examining the perceptions and behavior of men. Men hold social and sexual stereotypes or attractive women viewing them as sexually permissive, exciting, or sexually competent (Feingold, 1992; Tanke, 1982). These attitudes manifest themselves in the behaviors men exhibit when paired with attractive women. Men are more likely to reward attractive women and offer greater conversational involvement and self-disclosure (Snyder, Tanke & Berscheid, 1976). Men are also more likely to choose attractive woman over unattractive women as potential partners ignoring intelligence, social, or personality criteria (cf., Feingold, 1992; Jackson, 1993). It was hypothesized that many of the findings establishing a positive bias which men exhibit in response to an attractive woman may represent ingratiation tactics used to gain her liking. An experiment was conducted to examine self-presentation behaviors of college men who anticipate meeting and associating with an attractive or an unattractive female student. This research demonstrated that men seek to associate themselves with attractive women by claiming similar attitudes to gain positive reinforcement from her and/or to gain the approval of third parties. In addition men may do nothing to gain the liking of an unattractive woman and will attempt to dissociate themselves by appearing dissimilar to her in order to avoid negative impressions from third parties.

As a result, unequal family practices are maintained in societies based on an egalitarian ethics without, paradoxically, producing a feeling of injustice. This observation has been at the origin of several attempts of explanation, one of those being that the comparisons made by women are selective and lead them to view the unequal division of family work as appropriate. The present paper questions this explanation and attempts to show that most comparisons between men and women lead to evaluate similar behaviours in a different way, because they are adjusted to the traditional gender roles and thus rest on double standards. It defends that using identical criteria for the judgments of men and women's competences and roles is an indispensable condition to achieve more justice in our society.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a brief injunctive norms manipulation on both injunctive and descriptive norms about drinking alcohol and to explore differences in the malleability of norms across referent groups, sex, and gender role. Participants were 265 undergraduates (43% male, 70% freshmen) who completed a web-based survey for course credit. A randomly selected half was exposed to a page of information-based feedback about typical student injunctive norms. Relative to the control condition, the manipulation produced lower injunctive and descriptive norms related to typical students' drinking but no change in either type of norm related to close friends. Femininity was associated with less permissive normative beliefs about the acceptability of excessive drinking whereas masculinity was associated with elevated perceptions of peer drinking, but neither sex nor gender role moderated the manipulation effect. We conclude that perceptions of peer approval of drinking are malleable with a very brief information-based manipulation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,966

(2016","Attributions of responsibility, blame and justifiability to a perpetrator and victim in an acquaintance rape scenario: The influence of Marijuana intoxication.","Marijuana is a commonly used illicit drug by young adults and has been implicated in about one third of sexual assaults. However, the influence of Marijuana intoxication on rape attributions has not been previously investigated. This study examined the effects of perpetrator and victim Marijuana intoxication and participant sex on rape attributions. Young adults (N = 285) read an acquaintance rape scenario where Marijuana intoxication was manipulated and completed measures of perpetrator (responsibility, blame and justifiability) and victim attributions (responsibility and blame). The results revealed that an intoxicated, compared to sober, perpetrator was attributed less responsibility for his sexual aggression. When the victim was intoxicated, compared to sober, the perpetrator and victim were attributed less and more blame for the assault, respectively. These findings demonstrate that, irrespective of perceiver sex, Marijuana intoxication, like alcohol intoxication, results in an attributional double standard in favour of the perpetrator.

968,"Quintero, E. (2009",How are job applicants disadvantaged by gender-based double standards in a natural setting.,"Controlled experiments have found that mixed-sex interaction triggers the use of gender status beliefs encouraging actors to view men as more status worthy than women (Correll & Ridgeway 2003; Foschi 2000). When these mechanisms are at play in actual employment settings, the implication is that employers will be more inclined to hire, promote, and praise male workers even when they produce identical evidence of competence that their female counterparts. Although hiring settings are rarely accessible to researchers, this project identified a unique exception that permitted direct observation and data collection on real evaluations made in the course of live interactions. The context of this study is the Spanish exam system that is used to recruit applicants to fill important and highly desirable government jobs where women are currently under-represented. The first part of this project analyzes how male and female applicants fare at each testing round. I examined quantitative pass/fail exam data gathered from the Internet and information obtained from direct observation of exam sessions. Consistent with gender status theories, I found that female applicants scored higher than male applicants when exams evaluated female-typed skills and lower than male applicants when exams involved assessing neutral abilities-this effect was substantial in less structured exams (i.e. exam 3) where judges and applicants engage in an actual dialogue. The second section of this work analyzes the features and content of the live conversations that take place in the Q&A portion of exam 3. I audio-taped and transcribed 83 judge-applicant conversations and found that exam judges behave differently toward male and female applicants even when applicants perform at the same level. In particular, judges interrupt women more, ask them more questions, and are less persuaded by the objective quality of their answers. The main contributions of this work are (i) a substantive one, of increasing our knowledge on the sources of gender segregation, (ii) applying theory developed in laboratory settings in a natural context, and (iii) a methodological one, of using the method of conversation analysis to understand the dynamics of judges-applicants interactions.

969,"Rabe, M. E. (2007",Black mineworkers' conceptualisations of fatherhood: A sociological exploration in South African goldmining industry.,"The main question of this study is: How do black mineworkers in the goldmining industry conceptualise and experience fatherhood in present-day South Africa? In order to address this question four subsidiary research questions were formulated, namely: (1) How do the respondents characterise fatherhood? (2) What are the respondents' own recollections of being fathered? (3) How do migrant and resident respondents' experiences of fatherhood differ? (4) What influence do biological mothers or female partners have on father-child relationships as described by the respondents? The scripting perspective was chosen to underscore this study because it is a multilevel approach that takes the social milieu of fathers into account without ignoring the agency of fathers. The perspective focuses on three levels-cultural scenarios, interpersonal and intrapsychic scripting. A qualitative study was undertaken by way of in-depth interviews with 30 respondents during 2002. Ten of the original 30 respondents were re-interviewed in 2003. These interviews were augmented by general observations and fact finding interviews with key informants. In terms of the first research question regarding the way in which the respondents characterise fatherhood, it was found that the breadwinner role of fatherhood, is salient. However, traces of patriarchy and the so-called new fatherhood are often intertwined with the economic aspect of fatherhood. It was found that respondents' own recollections of being fathered included a stern disciplinarian pattern (""father is like a lion""), a ""bad fatherhood"" pattern and a ""good fatherhood"" pattern. Resident respondents related more involvement with their children compared to migrant respondents although varying degrees of distant and involved fatherhood could be detected amongst the migrant respondents. Resident respondents conveyed active involvement in father-child activities such as giving guidance to children and playing with them. Certain respondents have little contact with children they fathered with a woman other than their current partner. Female partners hinder any type of relationship to children born from adulterous relationships but children born from previous relationships may be taken care of. However, respondents who openly stated double standards regarding sexual practices for men and women, take care of all biological children with little concern for their wives' views.

A questionnaire of 96 items, about family has been used, this article stating 5 items on infidelity. The statistical analysis, the Pearson Chi-Square test, has been performed using the SPSS. 62% of the subjects do not agree with sexual infidelity ""at all"". About half ""would break up"" a partner having sexual relationships outside the couple's margins. 66% reported they never had sexual relationships outside the couple's margins. The disagreement is higher in females than males (71.3 vs. 52.6%). The number of females accepting sexual infidelity is almost 2 times bigger. The number of females that did not engage in a sexual relationship outside the couple's margins is higher than the number of males (81.9 vs. 50%) (p = 0.000). Women tend to link infidelity to the need of communication, affection and a ""weak personality"" while men link infidelity to the ""unsatisfied sexual needs"" (p < 0.05). In conclusion Romanians value fidelity within a couple. The double standard in evaluating sexual behaviour perpetuates society's higher tolerance to men's infidelity. Most often, individuals cheat in order to fulfil their unsatisfied needs that lack in their current relationships seeking for their satisfaction outside the couple's margins. These needs are seemingly different for men and women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,971
972,"Radcliffe, P. (2016",Defending serious sexual assault: Ethical and effective advocacy.,"Effective advocacy is at the heart of our adversarial system of justice. Unsuitable advocacy methods are unjust and do not accord with the overriding objective in criminal cases. Inappropriate questioning techniques generate unreliable witness testimony; they are also potentially abusive. Irresponsible advocacy is being corrected by the legal profession. Ethical and effective advocacy is the only 'just' way to 'test' witness testimony. The Ministry of Justice recently declared that by March 2015, it will 'devise a requirement' that all publicly funded advocates instructed in 'serious sexual offences' must undertake 'approved specialist training'. When this training will be implemented is uncertain. Advocates defending sexual cases require specialized skill sets in addition to a sound understanding of substantive law and the rules of evidence and procedure. In cases of serious sexual assault, sentencing tariffs are usually in double figures. Advocates have an overriding duty to the justice system to prepare and conduct cases to the highest professional standards. Pre-trial cross-examination of children will be introduced in all crown courts subject to positive evaluation of pilot schemes. Reform is long overdue. The objective is to enhance testimonial accuracy and reduce witness distress. The mechanics and nature of the adversarial trial are undergoing radical overhaul. This chapter describes the current 'revolution' in the courtroom and identifies new initiatives and guidance for advocates. Justice is only served via ethical and effective advocacy. Trial advocacy is the culmination of the advocate's task. This chapter emphasizes that pre-trial preparation is the 'touchstone' for good quality advocacy. The chapter focuses on complainants.

Four parenting styles are distinguished, based on patterns of parent-adolescent decision making: autocratic (parents decide), authoritative (joint process but parents decide), permissive (joint process but adolescent decides), and unengaged (adolescent decides). The sample included 3993 15-year-old White, Hispanic, African-American, and Asian adolescents. Results are generally consistent with previous findings: adolescents with authoritative parents had the best outcomes and those with unengaged parents were least well adjusted, while the permissive and the autocratic styles produced intermediate results. For the most part, this pattern held across ethnic and sociodemographic subgroups. There was one exception, suggesting that the relationship between parenting styles, especially the unengaged style, and depressive symptoms may vary according to gender and ethnicity.

(2003",The psychosocial context of young adult sexual behavior in Nicaragua: Looking through the gender lens.,"CONTEXT: Understanding the nature and magnitude of gender differences in sexual norms among young adults in Nicaragua, and how these differences affect sexual behavior, is important for the design of reproductive health programs. METHODS: A representative cross-sectional survey was conducted in six departments in the Pacific region of Nicaragua in 1998. A total of 552 never-married women and 289 never-married men aged 15-24 were interviewed about their perceptions of social pressure to engage in premarital sex; perceived social approval of and attitudes toward premarital sex and premarital pregnancy; perceived sexual activity among peers and siblings; communication with parents on sexuality issues; the psychosocial context of sexual debut; and preferred sources of information on sexuality issues. RESULTS: Most young men (83%) reported that they had received direct encouragement from at least one person in the last year to engage in premarital sex, and at least half perceived that their father, siblings, other relatives and friends approved of premarital intercourse. A significantly greater proportion of men than of women reported that curiosity or gaining experience motivated their sexual debut (61% vs. 21%). Men perceived themselves to have a higher risk of unplanned and unprotected sex than did women. In contrast, women held more negative attitudes toward premarital sex and were more often discouraged by parents or siblings from engaging in sex.

This study uses a person-centered approach and conceptualizes adolescent romance as multidimensional. In Study 1, a large, nationally representative dataset (the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) was used to classify 10th and 11th grade adolescents into ideal romantic relationship styles via Latent Class Analysis. Four classed emerged: Concealers (3.6%; n = 276), Abstainers (32.6%; n = 2508), Engagers (51.4% of the sample; n = 3955), and Family Builders (12.5%; n = 959). Concealers, primarily non-White ethnicities, preferred low social/emotional involvement but moderate sexual activities. Most adolescents with same-sex attractions were concealers. Concealers reported the greatest miss-match between ideal and real relationship activities. Abstainers, predominantly females, preferred: high social/emotional activities, to talk less about contraception/STDs, and low sexual activities. Engagers, predominantly male and White, scored highest on all social, emotional, and physical activities (exception of 'seeing less of friends', 'sex', 'pregnancy', and 'marriage'). Family builders, overly-represented by Latino, preferred high social, emotional, and physical dimensions including seeing less of friends, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and marriage. Moderate discrepancies occurred between ideal and real activities. Study 2 was a focus group study of White and Latino adolescents ( N = 75) entering 10th through 12th grades. Using a symbolic interactionism theoretical framework, adolescents described four types of sexual relationships within their social subjective realities: Going-out, dating, friends with benefits, and hooking up. Going-out relationships, an exclusive and emotionally/physically close relationship, were the most easily described and the most intense and committed relationships. Dating relationships, however, were the most common type of sexual relationship and were less easily defined, partially due to the ambiguity of the relationship itself which is to 'get to know each other'. These relationships were somewhat exclusive and required less obligations. Friends with benefits (primarily physical relationships) and hooking up (single physical encounters) were casual relationships that required little to no commitment. Findings are interpreted via a developmental/feminist lens. Gender inequality and sexual double standards are potent forces that continue to shape adolescent's sexual behaviors, feelings, and experiences.

980,"Repantis, D., et al. (2009",Antidepressants for neuroenhancement in healthy individuals: A systematic review.,"Neuroenhancement offers the prospect of improving the cognitive, emotional and motivational functions of healthy individuals. Of all the conceivable interventions, psychopharmacology provides the most readily available ones, such as antidepressants which are thought to make people ""better than well"". However, up until now, whether they possess such an enhancing ability remains controversial and therefore in this systematic review we will evaluate the effect and safety of modern antidepressants in healthy individuals. A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and cross-references was carried out and the pharmaceutical industry was contacted for suitable data. Trials published in any language through the third week of July 2007 were regarded. Included were single or double blind randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared a placebo to one or more of the following antidepressants: bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, moclobemide, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline or venlafaxine in any dose or dosing schedule. Eligible studies were those involving healthy people of any age and either sex who showed no evidence of a psychiatric disorder, cognitive decline or other disease. One hundred thirty-five articles met our inclusion criteria reporting single dose trials and trials with repeated drug administration. Sixty-five of these articles were eligible for a statistical analysis. Based on a linear mixed model, a meta-analysis and a fixed effects meta-regression were performed. Pooling of results by meta-analysis was stratified by the outcome measures (a) mood, (b) emotional processing, (c) wakefulness, (d) attention, (e) memory, and (f) executive functions. On a significance level of p < 0.05 the following significant results emerged: After a single dose of an antidepressant, a significant effect was shown in two of the analysed outcomes. Firstly, there was a small yet significant negative effect on wakefulness. On memory, a positive effect after several measurements was found, but this result could be traced to the results of the one study out of all included studies, which had that many assessment points. The analysis of trials with repeated drug administration (mean duration 14 days, standard deviation 9) yielded the following effects: on mood, a non-significant positive effect was detected that was continuously increasing and reached significance at the last assessment point. Regarding attention, a fluctuating effect was found, while for memory, the fact that the two groups started with a group difference confounded the results. For wakefulness there was no significant effect in any particular assessment point, while for emotional processing and executive functions, the small number of studies did not allow for any effect to emerge. In summary, no consistent evidence for enhancing effects of antidepressants could be found. There is little evidence so far to support the popular opinion that antidepressants have a positive effect on the mood of healthy individuals after repeated administration. No evidence of a significant adverse event profile could be found. The studies included in this systematic review not only provide insufficient evidence for or against any effect in healthy people, but they are inapt to be used for answering this question. This may be explained by the fact that most of them were not designed to examine neuroenhancement effects. The growing public interest in neuroenhancement stands in stark contrast to the paucity of data on enhancement effects of available psychopharmacological agents. Â© Springer-Verlag 2008.",0,980
981,"Reyes-Ortega, M., et al. (2003",Revision of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depresion Scale (CES-D). Pilot study with a Mexican geriatric sample.,"Introduction. Depression is one of the leading causes of disease and disability in the world. Yet, most cases of depression are ignored by the community or even at certain levels of the health care system. Thus, medical care is delayed, a fact that has a negative impact on public health and on socioeconomical conditions. In this context, screening instruments for depressive symptoms can help to improve the recognition rates, and therefore to offer adequate treatment. Also, timely referral to appropriate health care may be achieved. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is one of the instruments most widely used to screen depressive symptoms. The CES-D was created in the early 1970's, long before the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 classification criteria were available and therefore its content do not cover all the criteria included in these contemporary classifications. The present study is meant to be a first attempt to generate a new and revised design for the CES-D, and thus, to count on a reliable, valid, and suitable instrument to be used in the context of large community studies of depression. The revision is based on prior work carried out by Eaton and colleagues. Methods. In order to make a revision of the CES-D used for the Mexican elderly population, it was necessary to translate the revised instrument, to harmonize its items according to our culture and to the construct being measured, and also to adapt the questionnaire for a field-test pilot study. A survey among patients visiting a large primary health care clinic was then carried out (n=300). Because it was impossible to know in advance the number of patients that were seeking services each day, a sample by convenience was used. However, the sample was not influenced by age, sex or physical appearance of the patients. Before the interview actually started, informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The nature and scope of the study, the fact that their freedom to skip any question or to refuse their participation with would not affect their right to receive the services they were expecting. All was explained to each one individually, interviewers received training which included interview techniques and detailed discussions regarding ethical issues. The questionnaire for the survey gathered information on age and sex, and included the revised CES-D scale with 35 items, and the 30 questions listed in the Geriatric Depression Scale. Double, independent data entry was performed using EpiData software. The data were then translated into SPSS format, using the scale's algorithm that was developed by Eaton and colleagues (1988). This algorithm assesses the presence of symptoms according to DSM-IV criteria and sorts respondents into the following groups: ""Having significant clinical symptoms of major depressive episode"", ""probable major depressive episode"", ""possible major depressive episode"", ""sub-threshold depression"", and ""no-symptoms depression with clinical significance"". Further analyses were performed using STATA 7.0 version to assess reliability and validity of revised scale. Results. A total of 288 patients were actually interviewed, 191 of whom were females and 97 males. The age range of the sample was 60-92 years with a mean age of 73 years for males and 70 for females. Duration of the interviews was 21 minutes on the average; most of the interviews were completed within 13 and 30 minutes. In regard to reliability of the revised CES-D, Chronbach's alpha was 0.90, with similar coefficients by groups of age, sex, and by interviewer. Item-total correlation varied between 0.11 and 0.74, with 0.50 as the mean correlation. Factor analysis with main components, indicated a one-factor solution that accounted for 25% of the variance. In order to compare results from the revised version versus the original CES-D scale, a threshold to identify possible cases of depression was defined using the mean plus one standard deviation. The comparison indicated good to very good concordance between both scales (kappa = 0.79). However, it is important to consider that the revised CES-D includes the original scale plus 15 added items, and this might contribute to the concordance between the two scales. It is interesting to point out that 14 patients who were not classified as possible cases by the original CES-D scale were identified as such by the revised scale. On the other hand, the original scale identified eight patients as possible cases who were not classified as such by the revised scale. In this sample, based upon the revised version of the CES-D scale, four out of ten male or female patients reported depression symptoms. However, important differences by sex were found with respect to the proportion of patients gathered by groups of symptom severity. Among the female patients, 9% and 13% were classified as either having ""probable major depressive episode"" or with ""significant clinical symptoms of major depressive episode"". In contrast, male patients were more frequently classified as having sub-threshold depression (18%) or with a possible major depressive episode (6%). Discussion. The most important findings of this paper can be summarized as follows. A revision of the original CES-D scale is offered. The revised version of the CES-D reported in this paper has good to excellent internal consistency when administered through face-to-face interviews by trained personnel. The revised scale has adequate validity, suggesting that a functional instrument can be developed to be used in large community surveys, and also as an aid for clinically oriented work. The data gathered in our survey indicates that two out of three patients seeking primary health care do not present depression symptoms that might have clinical significance, whereas one out of eight elderly women might be undergoing a major depressive episode. Several important limitations of the present study need to be acknowledged. First, the sample was not drawn by random procedures and might not be representative of all elderly patients seeking health care in this family practice unit. Another important limitation is the lack of a clinical appraisal to confirm or refute results from the CFS-D. Yet, another limitation is the relatively small sample size of this study, which prevents us from performing further statistical analyses. In spite of important limitations such as these, our study offers important results. First, the internal consistency of the revised scale across interviewers and groups of age and sex suggests that this new version is at least as reliable as the original CES-D, and these results are consistent with findings reported by Eaton and colleagues in their study done in the US. The study also offers some evidence on the validity of the revised scale, at least in terms of content and construct validity. However, further studies are needed before more solid evidence is available. Directions for future work in this area include studies with clinical assessment depression symptoms to allow for comparison with results from the revised CES-D scale, as well as the need to obtain bigger and more heterogeneous samples to attempt replication of the preliminary findings reported here. Concepts and reference systems evolve with science and practice. The original CES-D was designed in the early 1970s and it was already out of date with respect to major classification systems such as the DSM-IV. The revised version of the CES-D conforms to DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode, and as such might be useful both in clinical settings and in epidemiologic studies.",0,981
982,"Rhee, K. S. and T. H. Sigler (2015",Untangling the relationship between gender and leadership.,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to empirically explore the perceptions of leader effectiveness and preference on gender and leadership style. Design/methodology/approach - The interaction between authoritarian and participative leadership style and gender roles was examined for effectiveness and preference using video samples of dramatized leaders. Findings - The results showed that although subjects found participatory leaders to be more effective and also preferred such a style over authoritarian leaders, male leaders were rated to be more effective and more preferred over female leaders. Women leaders who go against their gender stereotype were perceived as even less effective and less preferred than male leaders who exhibited the same style that was identified as a more masculine style. Research limitations/implications - The results suggest that women leaders continue to face challenges overcoming both sexual bias and stereotypes. Women leaders, regardless of style, face an uphill battle in terms of perceptions of effectiveness and preference regardless of who their followers might be. In addition, women leaders who go against the typical gender stereotype might be penalized even more. Practical implications - Despite making progress on gender equity, the study demonstrated the continuing existence of sexual stereotyping and bias in peopleâs perceptions, even with âyoungerâ subjects. Thus, we need to maintain our focus on actively changing the rules of the workplace (e.g. a recent Harvard Business School experiment) and changing the status quo. Until we level the playing field, we need to continue to play an active role in creating an organizational culture and shaping an environment that is fair and equitable. Originality/value - This paper highlights the current status of gender bias and stereotyping using an innovative methodology of video case studies. The results also highlight the persistence of gender bias and stereotype even in a âneutralâ setting with the younger subjects. In addition, the paper empirically demonstrates the double standards women often face in the workplace. Women leaders have often been expected to demonstrate more masculine traits at workplace (as exhibited by the authoritarian style), but when they do, they are penalized for acting out of their gender role.

Double standards were measured with a split-ballot design. The findings indicated that men were generally more disapproved of than women when displaying the family behaviors under study. Overall, women endorsed both double standards, whereas men endorsed only the double standard regarding divorce. However, substantial cross-national differences in the double standards exist. The higher the level of socioeconomic gender equality, the larger these double standards in favor of women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,984

With humor and ferocity, Valenti demonstrates the sweeping damage of the ""purity myth,"" which she defines as ""the lie that women's sexuality has some bearing on who we are and how good we are."" The film connects the antiquated dots from one's personal choices around sexual expression to today's conservative political movement to reinstate a patriarchal social order. The Purity Myth can help sex educators and students wade through today's political, cultural, and commercial messaging of normative absolutes and define one's own story of healthy sexuality.

986,"Robertson, L., et al. (2010",Sexual risk among orphaned adolescents: Is country-level HIV prevalence an important factor?,"Previous studies from sub-Saharan Africa have found that orphans experience increased sexual risk compared to non-orphans. We developed a theoretical framework for the investigation of determinants of HIV risk and used it to generate specific hypotheses regarding the effect of country-level HIV prevalence on the sexual risk experience of orphans. We expected that countries with high HIV prevalence would experience a higher prevalence of orphanhood. We further hypothesised that orphans in countries with high HIV prevalence would experience increased sexual risk, compared to non-orphans, due to pressure on the extended family network, which is primarily responsible for the care of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in poorer standards of care and guidance. We used hierarchical logistic regression models to investigate this hypothesis using cross-sectional, Demographic and Health Survey data from 10 sub-Saharan African countries. We found that countries with high HIV prevalence did indeed have higher prevalence of orphanhood. We also found that, amongst female adolescents, maternal and double orphans were significantly more likely to have started sex than non-orphans in countries with high HIV prevalence but were not at increased risk in low HIV prevalence countries. This effect of country-level HIV prevalence on the sexual risk of orphans was not explained by household level factors such as wealth, overcrowding or age of the household head. The same pattern of risk was not observed for male adolescents-male orphans were not more likely to have started sex than non-orphans. This suggests that orphaned adolescent women are an important target group for HIV prevention and that efforts should be made to integrate prevention messages into existing support programmes for orphans and vulnerable children.

It was found that persons are most restrictive in what they believe is proper conduct, more permissive in their reported behavior, and most permissive in their perception of what others are doing. During the early stages of dating, males and females differ widely in their outlook as to what is proper behavior and also in their reported behavior. Other studies which failed to take dating stage into consideration may have missed important gender differences in the early period of dating. Using data gathered from a 63-item dating and mate-selection questionnaire completed by 280 student and nonstudent respondents, in Southern New England, US, this study investigates the differences between what people believe is proper premarital sexual behavior, and what they think others are doing at 5 stages of dating. It was inspired by the suggestions of several other studies and general observations: that young people in the 1980s are more conservative in their general outlook, and possibly also in regards to premarital sex behavior. Another purpose was to examine the influence of social factors such as age, gender, religion, mother's education, father's education, residence, and religiosity. The sample consisted of college students from a state college and college-age youths. Behaviors were placed in categories ranged from the least to the most intimate. There is an increase in permissiveness for both males and females at each successive stage, with females most likely to engage in sexual intimacy in the committed stages of a relationship. Differences between male and female attitudes disappear towards later stages. It was found that persons are most restrictive in what they believe is proper conduct, more permissive in their reported behavior, and most permissive in their perception of what others are doing: there is a pull from the reference group in favor of permissiveness. Analysis of the data indicates there is a much higher level of sexual activity than in the 1950s and 60s. 3 factors: gender, religiosity, and religious attendance were found to make statistically significant differences to the dependent variables.

As a result, the new social space of the cinema was under scrutiny by a variety of social purity groups made suspicious of the opportunities offered by the dark, warm, democratising new buildings. The khaki fever moral panic proved to be the means through which society interrogated these developments. In order to maintain a sense of propriety in the midst of social change, the government introduced measures to limit sexual permissiveness to prevent the spread of venereal infection from affecting soldiers sent to the front.Women patrols were introduced, sourced from social purity groups established in the 1880s. They patrolled sites of particular cultural resonance to prevent the rise of sexual permissiveness. What appears to have been at stake here is both the right of women to work within the police force and the right of younger women to express their sexual independence. Both camps chose to make the cinema their battleground.This paper assesses police observations regarding the Rink Cinema, Finsbury Park, concluding that these issues were indicative not only of generational and moral anxieties, but also of the fear of the impact of modernity upon British society.

A leading factor is a double standard of aging in society that leaves women sexually devalued compared with their male age peers. The sociocultural image of the older woman (most clearly articulated by advertisements) is the central motivational force behind contemporary women's rituals of rejuvenation.

Participants were romantically involved heterosexuals (N = 252; 51 women, 201 men; Mage = 41.13, SD = 9.82) registered on a dating Web site directed at romantically involved individuals. Results showed that sociosexuality, alongside commitment, was associated with sexual infidelity. Individuals who had (versus had not) previously engaged in infidelity reported more unrestricted sociosexuality, while reporting less commitment. For individuals reporting prior sexual infidelity, unrestricted sociosexual desire and lesser commitment were associated with more permissive perceptions of infidelity. For individuals reporting no prior sexual infidelity, greater commitment was always associated with more strict perceptions of infidelity. No gender differences emerged in the analyses. Also, no differences were found according to individual motivations (i.e., looking to know other people versus seeking casual sex) or relational motivations (i.e., individual registration versus registration as a couple) underlying individuals' registration on the Web site. These results are an important addition to the literature on infidelity by analyzing a specific sample motivated to engage in infidelity. Implications for future research are discussed.

Indicators of drinking versus abstaining behavior, include education, employment status, and gender specific normative permissiveness. Respondents with higher education and those employed are more likely to drink with those in blue collar/services occupation being slightly more likely to drink than those in white collar occupations. As expected, respondents with more permissiveness male or female drinking norms are more likely to drink. On the other hand, once we controlled for education and occupation, acculturation does not significantly change the explained variation of drinking versus abstaining. The gender difference in drinking versus abstaining behavior persisted even after we controlled for the sociodemographic variables, acculturation and drinking norms. Among drinkers, the indicators for both frequency and quantity include education, marital status, and gender specific normative permissiveness. Respondents with higher education drink less frequently and consume less alcohol per occasion. Married respondents drink less frequently and consume lower quantities of alcohol per occasion than those never married. But the gender difference in drinking frequency and quantity actually increases when controlling for marital status. Since married persons drink less frequently and in lower quantities than those disrupted or never married, and men in the sample are more likely to be married, men should drink less frequently and in lower quantities. Actually they drink more frequently and consume more alcohol. Respondents with more permissive male or female drinking norms drink more frequently and consume higher quantities of alcohol per occasion. In addition, support was found for a nonlineal model or the Acculturation Stress Theory, for the relationship of acculturation and both drinking frequency and quantity of drinks per occasion.

Scholars have shown that traditional mass media contribute to strengthening these stereotypes. The hypothesis of the present study is that new media, especially Web 2.0 environments, provide room for rewriting gender roles in relation to alcohol. To test this hypothesis, 2000 videos were retrieved on YouTube using a list of Italian keywords relating to drunkenness. The 142 most frequently viewed clips were then analysed through a multilayer visual ethnography method. It was found that representations of drinking practices on YouTube seem to reflect the conventional double standard. Female drinking is mainly interpreted as a sign of sexual willingness, and is strongly stigmatised. In most cases, moreover, women themselves actively contributed to creating the sexual meaning, both as video protagonists and as commenters. Analysed materials seem to show that even in a user-generated content medium such as YouTube, old gender stereotypes about drinking fail to be deconstructed. Conversely, the images and discourses that were analysed reinforce these stereotypes, reproducing the messages conveyed by mainstream media in an even more explicit and risky manner.

(2005",The influence of primary caregivers on the sexual behavior of early adolescents.,"Purpose: To describe rates of sexual intercourse initiation, anticipated level of sexual activity in the next 12 months, and other risk behaviors among fifth graders and to examine parental factors associated with such behaviors. Methods: This study is based on a cross-sectional, self-administered survey conducted with a nonrandom sample of 408 fifth graders and their caregivers. Children answered questions regarding sexual intercourse initiation, anticipated sexual activity in the next 12 months, and involvement in other risk behaviors. Caregivers answered questions about parenting factors such as monitoring behaviors, parent-child relationship quality, and parent-child communication. Bivariate and multivariable analyses examined the association of these variables with the adolescents' behaviors. Results: Almost 5% of girls and 17% of boys reported they had engaged in sexual intercourse. Only 34% of girls and 13% of boys said they did not expect to engage in any type of sexual contact in the next 12 months if they were going with someone they ""liked a lot."" Parental factors associated with fewer risk behaviors and expected sexual behaviors included higher levels of monitoring, fewer communication barriers, less permissive attitudes regarding adolescent sexual behavior, higher relationship quality with child, having fewer than five children in the household, higher levels of education, and being employed. Significant gender interactions were found for several variables. Conclusions: Adolescents are initiating sexual intercourse at extremely young ages. To delay early sexual activity and prevent adolescent pregnancy, prevention efforts must begin during the elementary school years and include those who raise and care for the adolescent.

The investigation considered whether the perceived role incongruence between the female gender role and the leader role led to a female leader disadvantage (as predicted by role congruity theory) or whether instead a female leader advantage would emerge (as predicted by double standards and stereotype content research). In Study 1, it was only when success was internally attributed that women top leaders were evaluated as more agentic and more communal than men top leaders. Study 2 showed that the favorable ratings were unique to top-level positions and further showed that the effect on agentic traits was mediated by perceptions of double standards, while the effect on communal traits was mediated by expectations of feminized management skills. Finally, Study 2 showed that top women leaders were evaluated most favorably on overall leader effectiveness, and this effect was mediated by both mediators.

Prevalence study: all patients known to have multiple sclerosis who were alive and resident in the study area on 15 March 1995 were recorded. Results: The crude annual incidence rates of probable or definite multiple sclerosis per 100,000 population were the highest ever reported: 12.2 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 10.8-13.7) in the Lothian Region and 10.1 (95% CI 6.6-13.6) in the Border Region.

Instead, men endorsed sexual exchange more than women did, which supports the idea that SET is a vestige of patriarchy. Further, men's sexual advice, more than women's, enforced the sexual double standard (i.e., men encouraged men more than women to have casual sex)-a gender difference that was mediated by hostile sexism, but also by men's greater implicit investment in sexual economics. That is, men were more likely to suppress female sexuality because they resisted female empowerment and automatically associated sex with money more than women did.

The status incongruity hypothesis (SIH) proposes that agentic women are penalized for status violations because doing so defends the gender hierarchy. Consistent with this view, Study 1 found that women are proscribed from dominant, high status displays (which are reserved for leaders and men); Studies 2-3 revealed that prejudice against agentic female leaders was mediated by a dominance penalty; and in Study 3, participants' gender system-justifying beliefs moderated backlash effects. Study 4 found that backlash was exacerbated when perceivers were primed with a system threat. Study 5 showed that only female leaders who threatened the status quo suffered sabotage.

However, given expectations of normative gender behavior, the authors might anticipate that older men would be penalized most for not already having stable employment. This study aims to examine which hypothesis best describes selection biases based on age and gender. Design/methodology/approach: Stimuli depicting male and female job applicants at the various ages were developed.

Participants viewed six stimuli, one from each age by gender combination, and made evaluations across job relevant dimensions. Findings: Results showed an interaction between age and gender, such that older male applicants were evaluated more negatively than older female and younger male applicants. These findings support for the violation of gender normative behavior hypothesis. Practical implications: This study has implications for organizational leaders who can use this information to provide training for selection officers concerning biases against older workers and how to avoid them.

The double standard is identified early on whereas more public displays of deviance are not widely discussed until the 1980s. In between, the labeling of women with ""bad nerves,"" the overuse of sedatives, and the struggle to accept the disease model of alcoholism are all discussed in these women's stories.

(2012",Use of mutual support to counteract the effects of socially constructed stigma: Gender and drug addiction.,"This article describes the stigma women perceive as drug addicts and the strategies used to confront that stigma once they become members of a mutual support group, Narcotics Anonymous (NA). Stigma is heavily associated with being a drug addict and even more pronounced for the female drug addict. Public policy and media continue to focus on women's reproductive roles, igniting and perpetuating the stigmata associated with being female and addicted. The heavy emphasis on women's reproductive roles contributes to a double standard that women perceive it as unique to them as compared with their male counterparts. This study surveys a sample of women in NA that represents a potentially highly stigmatized group by race and class and uncovers the extent to which women perceive stigma both in their active addiction and once in recovery. Unexpectedly, women from a more socially disadvantaged background do not necessarily experience more stigma than their more privileged White, middle-class counterparts. Not surprisingly, women who have been involved in NA for longer periods of time and have completed the 12 steps perceive the least amount of stigma.

For the Rayleigh match, a red/green primary admixture is compared to a yellow standard. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that Rayleigh matches are determined by the separation between the absorption maxima of the X-chromosome linked pigments contained in the cones. The hypothesis was addressed in three parts. In the first part, four procedures for measuring match ranges were compared. Two degree match ranges were measured using a quasi-staircase procedure, and 9 degree match ranges were measured using a quasi-staircase procedure, a constant stimuli procedure, a double staircase procedure, and a two-interval forced choice procedure. In addition, a same/different experiment was used to test definitively for dichromacy. The sequences of the subjects' X-linked opsin genes, which had been inferred using molecular genetic techniques, were used to determine the separation between the absorption maxima of the subjects' X-linked pigments. The results showed that match ranges measured using the 9 degree fields were smaller and more similar to each other than were the 2 degree match ranges. Unexpectedly, an exponential relationship was shown between the 9 degree match ranges and the separations between the X-linked pigment absorption maxima. For the second part, a model of red/green chromatic discrimination was developed wherein the match range was determined from the separation between the cone absorption maxima. The spectral sensitivities of the cones were used to calculate sensitivities to the Rayleigh primaries, and in turn, were used to calculate predicted match ranges. The third part of the study compared the predicted match ranges to those measured in the first part of the study. In general, the predicted and measured match ranges agreed well.

The choice of early childhood education was influenced by internship placements in early childhood programs, positive early teaching experiences with young children, and parenthood preparation. The choice of a Montessori school was influenced by attendance in a Montessori school throughout childhood, compatibility with the Montessori philosophy, and a positive impression of other Montessori teachers. Several stereotypes or other concerns were noted, including experiencing sexual harassment, being wary of accusations of child molestation, being the butt of stereotypical jokes, and dealing with double standards. Parents were reported as happy that their child had a male teacher but suspicious if their child talked a lot about the teacher at home. (Contains 20 references.) (KB)",0,1015

A new typology was used to classify youth into a range of sexual intent and behavior categories including delayer, anticipator, single (sex partner), and multiple (sex partners).

The self-report surveys had been administered throughout California, predominantly in school settings, for the original 1992-1994 study. Findings revealed that male gender, African American or Hispanic ethnicity, greater alcohol use, lower school achievement, and perceived permissiveness of peers were significantly associated with youths' placement in higher risk typology categories at Time 1. No conclusions could be drawn regarding associations between demographic and psychosocial variables and birth control use/nonuse.

Biologists have failed to demonstrate that traditional sex roles in childcare are dictated by biologically given differences in the sex cells. They have also failed to demonstrate that nature has dictated the sexual double standard which currently prevails within our society. Nor have they proved, as they claim to have done, that the relations between the sexes, as they define them, have been given for all time by biology. Their explanations of these features of human sexual relations suppose certain forms of human social relationship that have not always existed. The validity of these explanations is not given, as sociobiologists imply, by unchangeable and eternal features of human biology. It is instead dependent on the existence of particular forms of human society--of societies in which surplus wealth is conferred on individual men to invest in their children, and in which labour power is available on a free market basis--forms of society which, although they have existed and continue to exist in parts of the world, have not always prevailed and need not always prevail in the future.

The variable tendency to define western prostitutes as causal agents in the transmission and spread of HIV/AIDS is noted, and the medical/epidemiological evidence against doing so briefly summarised. The impact of the AIDS pandemic on prostitutes and their work is discussed, as are a number of legal, ideological and representational issues relating to prostitution which have been given new salience by the AIDS debate. It is contended that the legal process continues to discriminate unjustly against women prostitutes; that a âdouble standardâ of sexual morality persists; and that prostitute groups have articulated a clear response to law and ideology, hinging on the deâcriminalisation of uncoerced adult prostitution. It is suggested that one likely consequence of decriminalisation would be improved access to health education and care facilities, as relevant for the general health status of women workers as for STDs, including AIDS.

However, there is no consistently effective standardized treatment for vulvodynia. Aim: To determine the feasibility and potential effects of using a standardized acupuncture protocol for the treatment of women with vulvodynia. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was vulvar pain, and sexual function was the secondary outcome. Pain was assessed by the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, and function was measured by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Methods: Thirty-six women with vulvodynia met inclusion criteria. The women were randomly assigned either to the acupuncture group or to the wait-list control group. The 18 subjects assigned to the acupuncture group received acupuncture two times per week for 5 weeks for a total of 10 sessions. Results: Reports of vulvar pain and dyspareunia were significantly reduced, whereas changes in the aggregate FSFI scores suggest significant improvement in sexual functioning in those receiving acupuncture vs. those who did not. Acupuncture did not significantly increase sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, ability to orgasm or sexual satisfaction in women with vulvodynia. Conclusion: This was the first randomized controlled pilot study to examine the use of acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia. The acupuncture protocol was feasible and in this small sample appeared to reduce vulvar pain and dyspareunia with an increase in overall sexual function for women with vulvodynia. This study should be replicated in a larger double-blinded randomized controlled trial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1022

Previous neuropsychologic studies have yielded diverging results, which may in part be explained by differences in the selection of Ss and methods. The present study focused on the question of cognitive frontal lobe performance in OCD. 29 unmedicated OCD patients were compared to a double-size control group of normal Ss matched individually for age, sex, and intelligence. A series of 12 neuropsychologic tests was applied, most of which are thought to be sensitive to different aspects of cognitive frontal lobe function. OCD patients were unimpaired at tests of abstraction, problem solving, set-shifting, response inhibition, active memory search, and choice reaction speed. Deficits of approximately 1 standard deviation were observed at timed tests of verbal and nonverbal fluency, attentional processing, and weight sorting. It is concluded that OCD patients exhibited selective deficits in tasks involving controlled attentional processing and self-guided, spontaneous behavior.

As part of the International Sexuality Description Project (ISDP), the SOI was translated from English into 25 additional languages and administered to a total sample of 14,059 people across 48 nations. Responses to the SOI were used to address four main issues. First, the psychometric properties of the SOI were examined in cross-cultural perspective. The SOI possessed adequate reliability and validity both within and across a diverse range of modern cultures. Second, theories concerning the systematic distribution of sociosexuality across cultures were evaluated. Both operational sex ratios and reproductively demanding environments related in evolutionary-predicted ways to national levels of sociosexuality. Third, sex differences in sociosexuality were generally large and demonstrated cross-cultural universality across the 48 nations of the ISDP, confirming several evolutionary theories of human mating. Fourth, sex differences in sociosexuality were significantly larger when reproductive environments were demanding but were reduced to more moderate levels in cultures with more political and economic gender equality. Implications for evolutionary and social role theories of human sexuality are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1024

1026,"Schopper, D., et al. (1993",Sexual behaviors relevant to HIV transmission in a rural African population. How much can a KAP survey tell us?,"KAP surveys have been proposed as a means to gather quantitative information on AIDS-related sexual behaviors, but the validity of survey results has not been tested. The validity of data gathered during a KAP survey in a rural district in Northern Uganda (N = 1486) was examined analyzing expected behavioral patterns, agreement of partner reports, and concordance of number of sexual contacts across gender. Patterns of sexual behavior and age trends are as expected. More men (50%) than women (18.5%) reported premarital sex. The likelihood of sexual intercourse before marriage increases with age at first marriage and with education. Women marry 5 years earlier than men, and the number of marriages increases with age. Peak incidence of casual sex occurs before age 25. The male/female ratio of casual sex is 4, as compared to about 3 in other African surveys. Single men are 2.5 times more likely to engage in casual sex than married males. Agreement of partner reports was examined for 392 couples selected by chance. 86% of the couples agreed on being polygamous or monogamous. On average men reported 1.3 (SD = 0.7) wives as compared to women reporting 1.5 (SD = 0.89) wives (P <0.001). 16.8% of women declared more, and 2.8% less cowives than their husband (r = 0.65). Self-reports on frequency of sexual intercourse in the past month were examined for 256 monogamous couples. Mean frequencies differ (5.24Â±5.1 for men, 4.43Â±4.7 for women, P<0.001). 42.8% of couples are in agreement within Â±1 unit (r=0.44). The total number of extra-marital and marital sex acts, as well as the total number of partners reported by each gender are similar. There is, however, a striking gender difference in reporting of casual partners in the past year. Data were found to be accurate at the aggregate level. However, accuracy of reporting at the individual level was found to be low. The gender difference in reporting of casual partners may be due to female underreporting, to not having captured prostitutes or to a different perception of the meaning of casual partnership. All KAP surveys should include a validity analysis, so as to provide a sense of the accuracy of the surveys and allow for comparison of the quality of different KAP surveys. There is an urgent need for a standardized approach to validating the findings from AIDS-related KAP surveys. Some of the indirect methods described here could be relevant for further use.

1027,"Schott, R. M. (2010",,"Sex crimes are perpetrated against women civilians around the world, and appallingly the number of these crimes is increasing rather than decreasing. Amnesty International reports that forty thousand women and girls were raped in the Congo in the period 1999-2005. Sexual torture has been documented in Rwanda, the Sudan, Yugoslavia, Iraq, and East Timor (Booth 2005: 118). For those of us interested in the safety of women and girls, and their economic and political rights, addressing the issue of war rape is high on the agenda. This issue has recently attracted active engagement by international lawyers as well as by scholars working in political science, anthropology, and psychology, to name a few fields. The question that motivates me here is whether sexual violence also puts a claim on philosophical reflection. My starting point is that sexual violence does demand the engagement of philosophers. Just as Hannah Arendt argued that twentieth-century totalitarianism and the Nazi death camps placed a demand to reflect on the fundamental problem of evil, so I argue that sexual violence in wartime puts a demand on us to reflect anew on the fundamental relation between the human body and the body politic. In this essay, I will be thinking with Hannah Arendt on the relation between the body and the body politic, though I will arrive at some non-Arendtian conclusions.1 Sexual violence in wartime is not new to the twentieth century, though I will discuss below features that are specific to the twentieth century. We find references to it in Homer's Iliad, as well as references to capturing women in war in the Hebrew Bible. Not until the fourteenth century did European leaders announce standards of chivalry to forbid rape, though these rules were rarely enforced. The license to rape was considered a major incentive for being a soldier (Niarchos 1995: 660-62).2 Not until the nineteenth century did humanitarian law protect noncombatants, including women. In the twentieth century, mass rape occurred during the Rape of Nanking, which refers both to the rape of 20,000-80,000 Chinese women by Japanese soldiers in 1937 and the killing orgy that took 350,000 lives in a few weeks. During World War II, up to two million women were raped by soldiers in the Soviet army (Beevor 2002).3 The French army allowed Moroccan soldiers to rape Italian women. And there was evidence of major Nazi sexual crimes against French women, though the Nuremburg tribunal did not mention rape in the final judgment.4 Rape did take place in Auschwitz, though there has been a conspiracy of silence about it, and the victims of rape in the camps were psychologically the ""sickest"" after liberation (Krystal 1968: 342). In the 1990s, not only did war rape take place in Europe (with an estimated 20,000-50,000 women raped in the former Yugoslavia), but during the genocide in Rwanda when 500,000 to 800,000 Rwandans were massacred, the majority of them Tutsi, at least a quarter-million women were raped. In the Congo, every armed group has discovered that rape is a cheaper weapon of war than bullets (Goodwin 2004: 8-22). A Human Rights Watch specialist noted that women have had their lips and ears cut off and eyes gouged out after they were raped, so they cannot identify or testify against their attackers (ibid.). Until recently, sexual violence in wartime has been characterized by physical invisibility-in the double sense that civilian casualties are often invisible in official casualty statistics and that rape does not always leave visible signs on the bodies of the victims. With this physical invisibility has been a political invisibility. What is new in the late twentieth century is the political visibility, of war rape which has had decisive consequences for international law. The United Nations resolution leading to the establishment of the Yugoslavia Tribunal contained the Security Council's first condemnation ever of war rape. Richard J. Goldstone, chief prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda (1994-96), otes that despite the fact that rape is a war crime that has been occurring for centuries, it had never received sufficient attention even to justify definition. The Rwanda Tribunal took a major step by defining rape as ""a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive.""5 In the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (1998), gender crimes are no longer subsumed under outrages to personal dignity, but are expressly named as crimes against humanity and as war crimes in both national and international armed conflict.6 This legal shift from treating war rape as an offense to personal dignity to treating it as a violation of human rights is also based on the changed character of conflict in the sociopolitical, religious, and ethnic civil wars of the twentieth century. These conflicts involve the politicization of daily life, the centrality of the body as a physical and symbolic object of strife, and often a familiarity with the enemy (Van Boeschoten 2003: 43). Following the war rapes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and their judicial recognition as crimes against humanity,7 there has been a rapid growth of research in the issue of war rape. Much of the research focuses on causal explanations, from a wide variety of social and psychological perspectives. Some scholars have argued that war rape should be understood primarily from the point of view of psychohistory, by which war rape is understood as arising from abusive child-rearing practices, in which maternal abuse is considered central for the mentality of rapists (Demause 2002: 371). Others have argued that war rape should be understood primarily in terms of patriarchy's oppression of women. And still other scholars emphasize the role of nationalism in the escalation of sexual violence both during and after wartime conflict.8 My purpose here is not to adjudicate causal explanations of war rape, but to explore the meaning of the body that is implicit in war rape, and its implications for theory of political community. The relation between the individual body and the political community has been much discussed recently, with focus particularly on the role of discourse in constituting subjects as ""heterosexual"" or ""homosexual."" Here I will raise different questions about the relation between the body and the political by focusing on the concept of birth and its transformation in sexualized violence. I will analyze the phenomenon of war rape by tracing the concepts of the ""body"" and the ""political"" in the work of two thinkers: the German-born philosopher Hannah Arendt and the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Arendt introduced the concept of natality-referring to new beginnings in human life-which plays a vital role in her understanding both of the human condition and of political life. For Arendt, the metaphorical meaning of birth as new beginnings-as opposed to death and endings-is decisive for political thought. By contrast, Giorgio Agamben views life's subjection to a power over death as a key for reflecting on political power (Agamben 1998: 83). I will study the implications of war rape-not mentioned by Arendt, but discussed briefly by Agamben-for their reflections on the relation between the body and the concept of the political. If one follows Arendt's analysis of natality, war rape appears as an event that violates the fundamental qualities of political life. If one follows Agamben's focus on the power over death, war rape appears as a phenomenon that discloses the fundamental workings of political power. I will consider which path is most productive for an analysis of war rape. Â© 2010 by Indiana University Press. All rights reserved.",0,1027

In particular, I investigate whether changes in permissiveness are mainly due to period effects or to cohort replacement. I also compare the trajectory and pace of change in the two countries. Second, I use data from the International Social Survey Programme to compare British and American attitudes with those of four other nations with very different socio-political and religious traditions - Ireland, Germany, Sweden and Poland. With the exception of attitudes to pre-marital sex, attitudes have not changed very dramatic-ally over the past few decades. Attitudes towards homosexuality are becoming slowly more tolerant, especially among women, but condemnation of extra-marital sex has remained high. Religion plays an important role in explaining both within and cross-national variations in attitudes and provides a powerful counterbalance to permissive trends. I conclude that change has not been as revolutionary as is often claimed and the demise of traditional values is over-stated.",0,1029

In a recent survey of the status of parenting education, 29 states reported offering parenting education. Programs in parenting should deal with vocational and family life education, supportive family relationships, emotional needs, health and family planning, and the availability of social services and crises counseling. It is suggested that: (1) Colleges of education become more aware of problems facing a changing society and implement appropriate courses; (2) State boards of education, in conjunction with parent and teacher committees, develop Parenting Education curricula; (3) State boards of education establish minimum standards for teachers of parenting education classes; and (4) Public schools cooperate with other state agencies in dealing with parenting.

Therefore clinicians in everyday practice have to rely mainly on personal or anecdotic experience. The aim of present study was to define the most suitable sociodemographic and disease-related profile for the use of paroxetine as an antidepressant treatment. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) in English focused on ""paroxetine"" and ""depressive disorder"" or ""major depression"". We also considered reviews and meta-analyses focusing on paroxetine. Fifty-five total unique RCTs were included and sociodemographic and clinical data as moderator of efficacy measures (standardized mean difference based on Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) were investigated via meta-regression analysis. Results: Paroxetine was significantly characterized by better response in females and in Caucasians, whilst for patients who have been ill for a longer time before treatment, the smaller was the antidepressant effect. Other disease-related variables were not found to be significant moderators in clinical outcome. Limitations: Meta-regression may lack sufficient sensibility to detect specific subtle features, so a failure to find significant effect is not definitive evidence of a lack of effect. Conclusions: Our results, though significant, were generally observed with small estimate values, their clinical relevance is subtle since each feature is expected to influence marginally the whole outcome, and probably a more pronounced effect could result only by analyzing very large samples.

(2010",Animal sex: Purity education and the naturalization of the abstinence agenda.,"An early-twentieth-century movement for social purity in England, Canada and the United States aimed to eradicate prostitution, the double standard of sexual morals and their dreaded corollary, the venereal diseases. Social purists suggested that 'purity education' for children was the best pedagogical prophylaxis against such medico-moral impurity. Popular purity education guides like the Self and Sex Series configured purity education as nature study lessons on reproduction in flora and fauna complemented by a back-to-nature regimen of diet, dress and exercise. Social purists hoped that purity education would induce children to adopt an abstinence agenda promoting heterosexual conventions of chastity before marriage, procreative marital sex and sound parenthood. The Series is used to investigate the ways in which the social purity movement turned to a highly selective vision of the natural order to naturalize the abstinence agenda.

Aim: To investigate effects of once-daily tadalafil in men with no successful intercourse attempts at baseline. Methods: Through a post hoc, pooled-data analysis of four randomized, double-blind trials on the effects of tadalafil 2.5 or 5 mg (vs. placebo) in men with ED, we evaluated efficacy and safety in subjects with 0 ""yes"" responses to Sexual Encounter Profile question 3 (SEP3) during an initial 4-week treatment-free run-in period. Main Outcome Measures: Changes from baseline in the SEP diary and the International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function (IIEF-EF) domain were subjected to analysis of covariance models. Results: Five hundred ninety-five subjects with no successful attempts at baseline were included in the analysis. The mean ( +/-standard deviation) age was 58.2 +/- 10.7 years; and most subjects had ED for >= 1 year (95.0%). ED was severe in 61.5% and moderate in 26.4%. Approximately 45% had diabetes mellitus or hypertension. After 12 weeks, the mean per-patient SEP3 percentage increased from 0% to 32.4% with tadalafil 2.5 mg and to 46.4% with tadalafil 5 mg (each P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Corresponding data for successful penetration (SEP2) were increases from 21.1% to 48.2% with tadalafil 2.5 mg and from 24.4% to 66.2% with 5 mg (each P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Mean IIEF-EF increased from 9.7 to 15.7 with tadalafil 2.5 mg and from 10.7 to 19.2 with 5 mg (each P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Tadalafil also significantly improved the intercourse-satisfaction and overall-satisfaction domains (vs. placebo). Both doses of tadalafil were generally well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar to placebo. Conclusions: The posttreatment intercourse success rate was 32% and 46% for tadalafil 2.5 mg and 5 mg, respectively, in men with no successful intercourse attempts at baseline.

(2005",An application of physical feminism theory to women's gender role and self-defense training.,"This study examined the gender role beliefs (GRBs), self-characteristics (self-esteem, assertiveness, body esteem) and assault history of women and girls in full impact self-defense programs both pre and post class participation. Many researchers state that the GRBs of women are pervasive and become physically manifested (Kaschak, 1992; McCaughey, 1997). In addition, a culture permissive toward rape is one factor that affects women's self-characteristics (RAINN, 2001; Warshaw, 1994). This study examined women's GRBs and how they relate to their self characteristics and assault history. Additionally, this researcher examined how self-defense classes affect these variables. The literature suggests that self-defense classes affect self characteristics, but there has not yet been a study that examined GRBs (Lidsker, 1992; Shim, 1998; Smith, 1984). Participants (N = 38) were solicited from full-impact self-defense programs in urban cities of California. This researcher mailed packets of questionnaires to each student prior to attending class and asked her to complete and mail it back before the start of class. Similar procedures were used for post testing. The MANOVA results suggest that change occurred from pre to post self-defense class. A Canonical Correlation was performed for the second hypothesis that predicted that GRBs correlated with self characteristics. Three variate pairs were found to be significant, and specific correlations are noted. The final hypothesis stated that women's GRBs would predict their assault history. A Discriminant Function Analysis was run to test this, and it was not significant. The results suggest that participation in a full-impact self-defense class can significantly change a woman's GRB and self characteristics. The overall combination and the univariate predictor of assertiveness were significant in predicting change. This suggests that self-defense programs may be a healthy alternative or addition to therapy. The analyses also indicated that GRBs do correlate to self characteristics. Specific correlations indicate that three variations of gender roles emerge for the women, and each gender role type may benefit from increased assertiveness. The final hypothesis was not significant, suggesting that GRBs do not solely predict assault history. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1038

(2008","Boyfriend, girlfriend in a traditional society: Parenting styles and development of intimate friendships among Arabs in school.","The development of intimate same- and other-sex friendships in Arab children and adolescents in Israel was investigated in relation to their perceived parenting styles. It was hypothesized that girls would show higher levels of intimacy than boys, and that cross-sex intimacy in both groups would increase with age, whereas same-sex intimate friendship maintains rather stable over the school years. We hypothesized further that intimate friendship would be contingent more readily on perceived parental authoritative style rather than on either permissive or authoritarian styles. Participants were 723 Arab students drawn from four schools, and from the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th grades. The Parental Authority Questionnaire and Intimate Friendship Scale were employed as measures. Findings indicated that girls were more intimate with their female friends than boys were with their male friends, especially in the higher grades, replicating previous studies. However, boys tended to score higher than girls on intimacy with the other gender. Girls equaled their level of intimacy only at the 11th grade. These findings suggest that traditional societies may foster specific characteristics of intimate friendship. A novel finding is the central role of the authoritative parenting style in determining intimate friendships. Results are discussed in terms of universal aspects of friendship and of their expression in the investigated cultural setting. Â© 2008 Sage Publications.",0,1039

However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations, and extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Because of their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.",0,1041

(2011",Between expectation and desire: Widowhood and sexuality in late medieval Iberia.,"This article explores the vulnerabilities and ambiguities of widowhood in late medieval noble society through the example of Isabel Cornell, a member of the aristocracy of the Crown of Aragon. Isabel was a beautiful and wealthy woman who had been left a widow at a young age and, as a consequence, was an object of pursuit by the noblemen of the realm. One of these, a cousin, composed a substantial poem elegizing both her physical attractions and her moral purity. Isabel, however, was faced with a dilemma, in that were she to remarry she would lose control over her former husband's patrimony and her influence over and custody of her own son. As a consequence it seems that she may have been driven to take matters into her own hands, carrying out a clandestine affair with at least one if not two noblemen. At least this is how the indictment reads-a deposition in which her own slave girls testified at having caught her in flagrante. While the outcome of the case is unknown, it brings into relief the moral double-standard of the day, in which the adulterous affairs of men were regarded as inconsequential, whereas the adulterous affairs of women became matters of public and legal record and could have life-shattering repercussions. It also highlights the contrast between contemporary moral ideals and actual behavior and between literary representations of widowhood and real-life social dynamics that both informed and defied them.",0,1045

""Male Subjectivity at the Margins"" will also maintain that there is nothing ""natural"" or culturally innocent about sexuality. It will, however, attribute a much greater degree of specificity to the psyche than does ""The History of Sexuality,"" and articulate a more complex interaction between it and the social order-an interaction involving a series of ""relays."" It will argue that we do not directly inhabit either the symbolic order or the mode of production, but are accommodated to their Laws via an ideological facilitation. It will also insist that we accede to this ideological facilitation only through fantasy and imaginary ""captation.""

Parenting beliefs and ratings predicted adolescent-reported maternal psychological control and parental monitoring. Adolescents who rated parents as more restrictive in their control of personal issues and who believed that parents should have less legitimate authority over these issues rated their mothers as higher in psychological control. In contrast, more adolescent-reported parental monitoring was associated with gender (being female) and adolescents' beliefs that parents have more legitimate authority to regulate personal issues. Adolescent age and gender influenced mother-reported monitoring and psychological control; in addition, the effects of mothers' ratings of restrictive control on both psychological control and monitoring were moderated by gender.

This study examines the epidemiological bases for applying an additive rather than a multiplicative specification when testing for interaction between two discrete risk factors. We specifically predict that risks associated with being nonmarried and with being poor .interact to produce mortality risks that are greater than each risk acting independently. The analysis is based on men and women who were ages 25-74 during the 1971-1975 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I) and who were traced successfully in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study in 1982-1984. Overall, being both poor and nonmarried places nonelderly (ages 25-64) men, but not women, at risk of mortality greater than that expected from the main effects. This study shows that for all-cause mortality, marital and poverty status interact for men but less so for women; these findings exist when interaction is assessed with either a multiplicative or an additive standard. This difference is most pronounced for poor, widowed men and (to a lesser degree) poor, divorced men. For violent/accidental deaths among men, the interaction effects are large on the basis of an additive model. Weak main and interaction effects were detected for the elderly (age 65 +).

It also frames school formals (balls or proms) and associated after parties as problematic sites, since young people may drink to excess at such events. This article explores the alcohol consumption patterns of a group of year 13 students on the night of their school formal. Adults' permissive attitudes towards their own and young people's alcohol consumption on the night are discussed to highlight how drinking is almost necessary for socialisation in a New Zealand context. The majority of student participants reported that they drank in moderation on the night and some were intolerant of intoxicated peers. This poses a challenge to New Zealand media depictions of the school formal and after party as 'drunken affairs'. Some international students did drink to excess at unofficial after parties organised by students and/or parents in two of three participating schools. Rather than this reflecting negatively on the students concerned, such behaviour can be read as a reflection on New Zealand's binge drinking culture. This article concludes with suggestions for how schools can create safer after parties which may reduce the chances of young people engaging in 'risky' drinking behaviours at such events.

However, the literature examining OT among couples is scant and has yielded mixed findings. The current study examined the effects of OT versus placebo on emotional (e.g., warmth and anger) and physiological (e.g., skin conductance and heart rate) reactivity to a conflict resolution task in 30 heterosexual couples (N = 60) in which one or both members misused substances. Using a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled design, both partners within each dyad were randomized to the same treatment condition. Participants completed a standardized conflict resolution task at baseline and 45 min following drug self-administration. Physiological measures were examined continuously during the laboratory tasks, and emotional reactivity was self-reported at baseline and at five time points over the course of 1 hr following the second conflict resolution task. Results of a multilevel growth curve model accounting for baseline scores, gender, and drug condition indicate that positive emotional experiences and skin conductance measures increased over the five time points. Neither drug condition nor gender was significantly related to outcomes, and no interaction effects were observed. These findings highlight the complexities involved in translational OT research and suggest that the impact of OT on key outcomes requires further exploration in regards to OT's potential therapeutic benefit.

Rates of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are also on the rise. Research suggests that several variables are closely related to human sexual behavior, namely sexual attitudes, HIV-transmission knowledge, and gender. Individuals with more permissive sexual attitudes tend to engage in riskier sexual behaviors. Studies examining the relationship between sexual knowledge and risky sexual behavior show both positive and negative associations. Although risky behaviors can occur between partners of any gender, the present study focuses on heterosexual relationships. The present study uses data from a nationally representative sample of 3,737 adults living in the People's Republic of China (PRC) who completed a computerized interview about their sexual knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. I used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a mediation model with permissive sexual attitudes as a mediator between HIV-transmission knowledge and four risky sexual behaviors: number of sexual partners, extradyadic sex, age of first intercourse, and paying for sex. I found significant indirect effects of attitudes on every risky sexual behavior other than age of first intercourse. There was a significant gender moderation such that attitudes predicted stronger effects on behavior for women than for men. These findings have implications for future efforts to create interventions and prevention programs for risky sexual behavior. Although the present study has some limitations, it contributes to a gap in the literature by replicating a Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model of risky sexual behavior a large, representative sample of adults across the PRC.

In her study of the life of Queen Caroline, I will suggest that Hays pushed the boundaries of the radical politics she had shared with Wollstonecraft in the 1790s, vigorously rejecting the sexual double standard enshrined by the George IVâs supporters in their relentless crusade to ruin the Queen, while also making a plaintive plea for a womanâs right to an erotic life.

1061,"Springer, A. (2011","Freud, Gross, sexual revolution.","This chapter discusses the ideas of a ""sexual revolution"" and the writings of Freud and Otto Gross as well as the influences of psychoanalysis and politics. The term 'sexual revolution' in the context of this chapter needs clarification. Since we will be concerned with constructs of ideas from the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century, the concept of sexual revolution that we are talking about needs as a cultural frame the standards of bourgeois morality prevalent during that epoch. It is based therefore also on a critique of some features of that set of moral rules, such as double moral standards or surplus repression of sexual acting out, as well as on the commitment to free women from the restraints of double moral standards. It seems clear that simple acting out of sexual desires is not a revolutionary issue. On the part of the male gender, that kind of lifestyle was rather usual during the late nineteenth century, as has been vividly depicted by the great novelists of that period. But we know that moral standards reigning at the same time led to a markedly different situation for men and women. Even if in Schnitzler's play Reigen (a remarkable document of the sexual-and seemingly liberal-mores of that time) libertinage is not restricted to men, there can be no doubt that female sexuality was kept down through the means of the taboo of virginity, and that transgressions of the rules of monogamy committed by women were sanctioned and eventually became both pathologised and criminalised. Unrestricted satisfaction of sexual needs alone therefore does not signify sexual freedom either on the social or on the psychic level and 'sexual revolution' must be something other than a call for erotic acting out. On a conceptual level it has to target attitudes and values and most importantly has to focus on the eradication of gender-related discrimination. A process that included such issues and therefore can indeed be called 'sexual revolution' started in the late nineteenth century in bohemian circles in many places and it also occurred in Vienna within the small group of early psychoanalysts.

In general there was a good measure of agreement between males and females in each country. Comparisons between different forms of related behavior raised the possibility that for some assessments reference may be made to widely accepted standards while for others there may be more use of discriminatory judgments. Comparisons between males and females, respectively, showed that the extent of cross-cultural agreement did not justify the claim for the universality of moral judgments.

Methods: Data from three similar 14-week studies (an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase and a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase) of aripiprazole augmentation were pooled for this post hoc analysis. Two age groups were defined: younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (aged 50-67 years). The older patient group was further divided into three subgroups: 50-55, 56-60, and 61-67 years. The efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from end of the prospective phase (Week 8) to endpoint (Week 14, last observation carried forward (LOCF)). Remission was defined as MADRS total score <=10 at endpoint. Results: Four hundred and nine older patients (placebo, n = 198; aripiprazole, n = 2 l l ) and 679 younger patients (placebo, n = 341; aripiprazole, n = 338) were included in this analysis. Older patients receiving aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total score versus placebo at Week 14 (-10.0 vs. -6.4; p < 0.001; LOCF), similar to the improvement seen i n younger patients. Remission rates were significantly higher with aripiprazole versus placebo in older (32.5% vs. 17.1%; p < 0.001) and younger (26.9% vs. 16.4%; p < 0.001) patients. Akathisia was the most common adverse event in both the older (17.1%) and younger (26.0%) patient groups. Conclusions: Adjunctive aripiprazole was effective in improving depressive symptoms in older patients, 50-67 years, with MDD who have had an inadequate response to standard antidepressant medication.

1066,"Steffensmeier, D. J., et al. (1980",World War II and Its Effect on the Sex Differential in Arrests: An Empirical Test of the Sex‐Role Equality and Crime Proposition*.,"A common explanation for the decrease in the sex differential in arrests during World War II attributes it to a change in female sexârole behavior. Because of the wartime equalization of sex roles, particularly of expanding occupational roles of women, female arrest rates began to approach male rates. Two alternative explanations appear equally plausible: (1) changes in the sexâage structure of the population at risk and (2) changes in official reactions to female âsex offendersâ over the prewar to wartime period, as reflected in the differentiation in types of crimes for which males and females were arrested during World War II. The analysis examines these two alternative explanations, and finds that: (a) by simply correcting for the sexâage structure of the population, the narrowing of the sex differential is reduced considerably; and (b) by taking into account type of crime, and specifically by omitting offense categories that reflect the paternalism and double standard of sexual morality in society, the narrowing of the sex differential disappears. Finally, the predicted special effects of World War II on female arrests for property crimes did not materialize. Copyright Â© 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",0,1066

1068,"Stewart, S., et al. (2010",A single-blinded case-control study of memantine in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common debilitating psychiatric illness that typically improves but does not remit with first-line medication and behavioral treatments. Serotonergic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and clomipramine have provided the mainstay of OCD medication management for decades. Combined dopamine/serotonergic agents such as atypical antipsychotics are presently the only OCD-augmenting strategies proven effective via randomized controlled trials. Despite increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of glutamate in OCD, no controlled trials of glutamatergic augmenting agents have been reported. Methods: An intent-to-treat sample included 44 subjects receiving standard treatment at the McLean/Massachusetts General Hospital Intensive Residential Treatment (IRT) program, 22 of whom also received memantine augmentation. Admission, monthly and discharge measures of OCD, depression, and psychosocial functioning were collected by raters blinded to augmentation status. Matched controls were selected based on sex, initial OCD severity, psychosocial functioning, and timing of admission. The Clinical Global Improvement Scale captured global clinical change. Results: Mean (SD) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decreases were 7.2 (6.4) among the cases and 4.6 (5.9) among the matched controls, reflecting mean clinical improvement among the cases (27.0% decrease) but not the controls (16.5% decrease). Mean (SD) depression severity score decreases were 5.8 (9.5) among the cases and 4.7 (9.9) among the controls. Initial intrusive obsessions were significantly more severe among marked responders compared with limited response or nonresponse cases (4.4 vs 2.9; t = 2.15; P = 0.048). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary supportive evidence for the effectiveness of memantine as a glutamatergic augmenting agent in severe OCD. Future randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1068
1069,"Stodder, J. (1998",Double-surnames and gender equality: A proposition and the Spanish case.,"This paper begins by showing that double-naming can treat both sexes equally, and still achieve other properties that may seem mutually incompatible. It then considers Spanish naming as an approximation to this schema, and finds some evidence that the maintenance of female surnames may be connected to equal inheritance and a relatively high female status. Obviously, this evidence is only suggestive. Throughout North-America and Western Europe, a wide variety of surname compromises are now on display in real family lives. The double-surname system advocated here will not be adopted because of a logical proof, nor can the adoption of such a system secure the victory of cultural norms. Norms emerge rather from the decomposition of older norms, from millions of more-or-less unhappy compromises of people trying to 'have it both ways,' to bend old standards without breaking them. This paper's proposition on double-names shows only that certain egalitarian principles are not logically incompatible. That they may not be practically impossible is suggested by Spanish women's autonomy, and the decomposition of noble lineages in that country. If we are moving toward a new way of naming our families, then double-surnames may be an attractive compromise.",0,1069

(2018",Heritability and genetic integration of anterior tooth crown variants in the South Carolina Gullah.,"Objectives: This article presents estimates of narrow-sense heritability and bivariate genetic correlation for a series of morphological crown variants of the anterior dentition. These results provide insight into the value of dental phenotypes as evolutionary proxies, as well as the development of tooth crowns as integrated or modular structures. Materials and Methods: African American dental casts from the Menegaz-Bock collection were scored for a standard set of dental morphological variables using the Arizona State Dental Anthropology System. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability and genetic correlations were generated using SOLAR v. 8.1.1, controlling for the covariates of age, sex, and birth year. Analyses were run using ordinal/continuous scale variables that were then dichotomized at various breakpoints, consistent with standard practices in dental anthropology. Results: Heritability estimates were low to moderate for most traits, and lower in magnitude than those reported for odontometric data from the same study sample. Only winging, canine shoveling, and canine double shoveling returned narrow-sense heritabilities that did not differ significantly from zero. Genetic correlations were high among antimeres and metameres and low for different traits scored on the same tooth crown. These results affirm standard data cleaning practices in dental biodistance. Double shoveling was atypical in returning strong negative correlations with other traits, shoveling in particular. Conclusions: Additive genetic variation contributes to dental morphological variation, although the estimates are uniformly lower than those observed for odontometrics. Patterns of genetic correlation affirm most standard practices in dental biodistance. Patterns of negative pleiotropy involving lingual and labial crown features suggest a genetic architecture and developmental complex that differentially constrain morphological variation of distinct surfaces of the same tooth crown. These patterns warrant greater consideration and cross-population validation. Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,1070
1071,"Stokes, W. R. (1965",Intelligent preparation of children for adolescence.,"The thesis is that many adolescent problems, particularly those involving sex, can be strikingly reduced or eliminated by intelligent, rationally planned parental management beginning at birth. Among the principal features of desirable parental management, the paper stresses effective parent-child communication. Of approximately 1500 couples who received routine medical and psychological preparation for marriage during 35 yr, approximately 500 remained under continuing counsel and observation after their children came for premarital service. Thus conclusions could be drawn as to how effective the parents had been in preparing their children for adolescence and for marriage, and what type of parental management reduces problems of adolescence and increases capability for successful marriage. Young peoples' demand for earlier marriage is seen as acceptable when they have matured under improved standards of democratic process and sex education in the family.

Methods Data were collected using standardised interviews and community probability sample survey methods conducted as part of the WHO World Mental Health Surveys Initiative. Demographic and socioeconomic correlates of smoking are studied using cross-tabulation and logistic regression approaches. Within-country sample weights were applied with variance estimation appropriate for complex sample survey designs. Results Estimated prevalence of smoking experience (history of ever smoking) and current smoking varied across the countries under study. In all but four countries, one out of every four adults currently smoked. In higher-income countries, estimated proportions of former smokers (those who had quit) were roughly double the corresponding estimates for most low-income and middle-income countries. Characteristics of smokers varied within individual countries, and in relation to the World Bank's low-medium-high gradient of economic development. In stark contrast to a sturdy male-female difference in the uptake of smoking seen in each country, there is no consistent sex-associated pattern in the odds of remaining a smoker (versus quitting).

Identifying groups at risk for aging sexual stigma will help to focus interventions to reduce it. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine cross-sectional trends in aging sexual stigma attitudes by age group, generational status, and gender. Method: An online survey was administered to a national sample of adults via a crowdsourcing tool, in order to examine aging sexual stigma across age groups, generational status, and gender (N = 962; 47.0% male, 52.5% female, and .5% other; mean age = 45 years). An aging sexual stigma index was formulated from the attitudinal items of the Aging Sexual Knowledge and Attitudes Scale. Results: This sample reported moderately permissive attitudes toward aging sexuality, indicating a low level of aging sexual stigma. Though descriptive data showed trends of stigma attitudes increasing with age and later generations, there were no significant differences between age groups or generations in terms of aging sexual stigma beliefs. Men, regardless of age and/or generation, were found to espouse significantly higher stigmatic beliefs than women or those reporting 'other' gender. Conclusions: Aging sexual stigma beliefs may not be prevalent among the general population as cohorts become more sexually liberal over time, though men appear more susceptible to these beliefs. However, in order to more comprehensively assess aging sexual stigma, future research may benefit from measuring explicit and implicit aging sexual stigma beliefs.

It argues that Eliot espouses one or more of the causes of the contemporary Women's Movement in each text: the right to marry on one's own terms (entailing the right to choose one's partner and to live without abuse), the right to child custody, and the right to education and a vocation.

Infection (42.4%) and falls (20.9%) were the most common causes for emergency visits and hospitalization in the present study. Hospitalized patients with dementia spent a longer time in hospital for stroke (64.0 Â± 5.3 days) and falls (51.9 Â± 2.1 days) than those with infection, epilepsy, syncope, loss of consciousness, other causes (all P <0.01) or dehydration (P â¤ 0.05). Conclusions: Patients with dementia commonly attend our emergency clinic. These patients are older in age, have a higher hospitalization rate and have a longer hospitalization, especially due to stroke and falls, than patients without dementia.

(2015",The structure of the amygdala associates with human sexual permissiveness: Evidence from voxel-based morphometry.,"Sexual behavior is a critical function of human procreation. Despite previous studies that investigated the neural mechanisms of basic human physiological sexual functions, the neural mechanisms that underlie individual differences in human sexual permissiveness remain unknown. We used voxel-based morphometry and a questionnaire (scale for sexual attitudes) to measure sexual permissiveness to investigate the gray matter and white matter structural correlates of sexual permissiveness. Sexual permissiveness was negatively correlated with regional gray matter density of the structures involving the right amygdala and surrounding areas, and positively correlated with regional white matter density of the white matter area that spread around the left amygdala to the hypothalamus area. There were no gender-specific relationships in the neural correlates of our findings. These findings suggest that structural variations in regions that play key roles in the basic physiological aspects of human sexuality underlie individual complex sexual attitudes in social life.

(2017","MORMONS, GENDER, and the NEW COMMERCIAL ENTERTAINMENTS, 1890-1920.","In the early twentieth century, new forms of commercial entertainment - dance halls, movie theaters, amusement halls and parks, saloons and the like - emerged in urban areas, providing new ways for young Americans to amuse themselves. This essay explores the distinctive Mormon response to these new forms of amusement. Mormon leaders took up other progressive reformers' concerns about early twentieth-century amusements, but refracted them through a distinctively Mormon lens that was at once gendered and uniquely religious. Mormons rejected the progressive double standard that sought to constrain women's, more than men's, participation in these new entertainments, focusing on restraining both genders equally. While many progressives held women more responsible for the sexual transgressions they worried resulted from these new forms of entertainment, Mormons held men and women equally accountable. Moreover, while other progressives sought (and largely failed) to provide alternative, more wholesome, entertainment for American youth, Mormons successfully provided family and Church amusements that kept their youth safely ensconced within the Church community. By the end of the 1910s, Church leaders had officially institutionalized the provision of amusement for its members and the Church formally became a social as well as religious organization.

(1976",The Dear John syndrome during the Vietnam war.,"The 'Dear John' letter is a written communication to a soldier from a woman (wife or girlfriend) back home terminating the relationship. The relationship between a woman back home and a soldier, particularly during wartime, has some special characteristics. First of all, it is a relationship existing in spite of, and at times even because of a prolonged separation. This separation is usually of undetermined duration, and the return of the man is questionable since he faces danger of multilation and possible death. Sexual faithfulness during such separation is viewed through an exaggerated double standard of sexual morality. The fact is that in wartime the rejected men can only express their grief and/or depression in a destructive manner (homicide, suicide, going absent without leave or getting drunk), and the opportunities for dangerous behavior directed toward themselves and others are plentiful. Upon return home, the range of possible responses is much wider, including the opportunity to express anger towards the disappointing woman. Furthermore, there is the opportunity to find a substitute love object. Men on duty in wartime should not be informed in full detail of transformation of a separation into a termination of a significant relationship.",0,1088

We investigated sexual behavior and attitudes across generations and gender among a probability sample of the general population of Nonthaburi province located near Bangkok in 2012. A tablet-based survey was performed among 2,138 men and women aged 15-59 years identified through a three-stage, stratified, probability proportional to size, clustered sampling. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out accounting for the effects of multistage sampling. Relationship of age and gender to sexual behavior and attitudes was analyzed by bivariate analysis followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to adjust for possible confounding. Patterns of sexual behavior and attitudes varied substantially across generations and gender. We found strong evidence for a decline in the age of sexual initiation, a shift in the type of the first sexual partner, and a greater rate of acceptance of adolescent premarital sex among younger generations. The study highlighted profound changes among young women as evidenced by a higher number of lifetime sexual partners as compared to older women. In contrast to the significant gender gap in older generations, sexual profiles of Thai young women have evolved to resemble those of young men with attitudes gradually converging to similar sexual standards. Our data suggest that higher education, being never-married, and an urban lifestyle may have been associated with these changes. Our study found that Thai sexual norms are changing dramatically. It is vital to continue monitoring such changes, considering the potential impact on the HIV/STIs epidemic and unintended pregnancies.

For Ss imprinted on both the zebra and Bengalese finch, hybrids appeared to be more attractive stimulus birds than expected using the separate standard model. Results fit an alternative model, called the mixed standard model, which assumes that zebra finch males combine the imprinted information of the 2 rearing species in one internal representation that consists of elements of both species.

Although there was a wide divergence in linguistic performance among the informants, it did not appear to correlate with any of the socioeconomic variables, although there was some evidence that sex was a factor in the use of certain BEV features. An important factor in determining ability to write in Standard English as opposed to BEV appears to be the kind and degree of motivation each individual has, specifically the desire to assimilate, both culturally and economically, to the middle class. The linguistic variables with the highest percentage of occurrence included possessive ""'s"" absence, third singular ""s"" absence, ""a"" before vowels, adverbial ""s"" absence, and double negatives.

(2013",Association between risk behaviors and antiretroviral resistance in HIV-infected patients receiving opioid agonist treatment.,"Objectives: Antiretroviral (ARV) resistance is of concern. Opioid agonist treatment (ie, methadone or buprenorphine) is effective and decreases HIV transmission risk behaviors and HIV seroconversion. Despite prevention efforts, injection drug use (IDU) and risky sexual behaviors remain prevalent in patients receiving opioid agonist treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine in HIV-infected patients receiving opioid agonist treatment, the prevalence of HIV transmission risk behaviors, the prevalence of ARV resistance, and the prevalence of ARV resistance among those with risk behaviors. Methods: The design was a cross-sectional study of patients recruited from opioid treatment programs and outpatient practices. We measured demographic, drug treatment, and HIV clinical information (including ARV adherence), self-reported HIV risk behaviors and drug use, urine toxicologies, and genotype testing for ARV resistance (with both standard assays and ultradeep sequencing). Data analysis included descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-nine subjects were enrolled, 64%were male, 24%were white, and mean age was 46 years. Fifty-three percent were receiving methadone, 47% were receiving buprenorphine, and 80% were receiving opioid agonist treatment for 12 weeks or more. Fourteen percent reported unprotected sex, 7% reported sharing needles or works, and 60% had positive urine toxicology for illicit drug use. Fifteen percent had evidence of HIV resistance by standard genotyping; 7% with single class resistance, 3% with double class resistance, and 5% with triple class resistance. Ultradeep sequencing found additional class resistance in 5 subjects. Twenty-two percent of subjects with evidence of transmission risk behaviors versus 14% of subjects without risk behaviors had evidence of ARV resistance. Conclusions: Improved prevention and treatment efforts may be needed for HIV-infected, opioid dependent individuals receiving opioid agonist treatment to decrease transmission of ARV resistant virus, especially in resource limited settings.

Anticipated situational engagement was generally highest with the authoritative teacher and lowest with the authoritarian teacher. However, students' personal engagement and gender qualified these effects. The effects of the authoritative and authoritarian teachers versus the permissive teachers on anticipated situational engagement were more positive (or less negative) for students with high versus low personal engagement. Also, the positive effects of the authoritative and permissive teachers versus the authoritarian teacher were stronger for female students than for male students.

1096,"Thomas, B. (2018",Boys will be boys but lock her up: The effects of leader gender and integrity failures on followers' perceptions of leaders.,"The perceptions of leaders matter, across stakeholders and settings. Perceptions of leadership integrity serve a central role in how people view their leaders. Although the conceptual space of leadership integrity has recently enjoyed some clarification, the consequences of different types of leader integrity (e.g., moral integrity and behavioral integrity) have not been experimentally tested. Moreover, given evidence that a leader's gender can affect how followers perceive him/her, this project tested the effects of different types of integrity failures and their interaction with leader gender in influencing perceptions of a leader. The research tested hypotheses that, given an identical profile of failing leadership integrity, women will be evaluated less favorably than men, and that the kind of integrity failure will moderate the effect. To test these hypotheses, the research used a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 Factorial MANCOVA design and randomly assigned participants (N = 434) into one of eight experimental conditions. Leaders' moral integrity levels, behavioral integrity levels, and gender served as the first three assigned between-subjects factors, and the participants' reported gender served as a fourth between-subjects factor, with participant sex role attitudes serving as a covariate. Adult participants, recruited from an online labor market tool, were asked to first review application materials for a single leadership candidate applying to a fictional leadership role and then to evaluate that candidate using standard, quantitative measures, which served as the dependent variables. Results indicated that both integrity factors yielded strong, significant differences in evaluations of leaders. Regarding the proposed interactions, although women leaders, and high integrity leaders, were almost uniformly rated higher than their male, or low integrity, counterparts, the predicted interactions were not statistically supported. For the interactions that aligned with the hypothesized higher consequences for women of failing integrity, effect sizes were small and statistical values were not significant at standard levels. The research provided a first experimental test of two factors of leadership integrity---moral and behavioral consistency---and does not support the view these factors operate independently, although it does reaffirm the importance of integrity information in selection decisions. Moreover, it did not statistically support the predicted double standard faced by men and women whose integrity fails. This non-independence may also explain the lack of statistically supported hypotheses due to the spillover effects of each integrity factor onto the other.

In 1998, in yet another major twist, a new sexuopharmaceutical era was inaugurated by governmental approval of Viagra, a drug to treat impotence that rapidly achieved amazing levels of global recognition. It will be important to sexuality studies and to sexuality policy that this topic develops sufficient empirical and theoretical traction to pursue analyses of its meanings and effects on sociocultural, political, economic and personal dimensions as they unfold over time. One important challenge of such 'Viagra Studies' is to examine the phenomenon of Viagra itself, beginning with the legend of its discovery and the media spectacle surrounding its approval. This essay begins with the galloping popularity of pill-taking as an element in trajectories both of the medicalization and demedicalization of sexuality. Although new systems of regulation often serve to reinscribe old forms of control, and urologists' current involvement in sexuality classification and treatment seems to follow old paths of biological reduction and medical authority, factors such as the Internet may shift the sexuality dance in unpredicted directions.

This article used the proportional hazards model and the generalized estimating equations Poisson model to examine how acculturation influences the initiation of sexual intercourse and the number of sexual partners. The results show that acculturation leads to more liberal sexual mores among Asian American youth. However, despite what might be expected from the sexual double standard, the models show that more acculturated females, as indicated by their use of English at home, had an earlier onset of sexual intercourse and a higher number of sexual partners. This is the opposite of what would be predicted by the sexual double standard theory. This might be due to the fact that Asian females tend to be more socially accepted by the host society than Asian males. Information on partners shows that Asian American females have more diversified racial backgrounds than their male counterparts. They are also more likely to have older sexual partners.

1102,"Trigg, M. K. (2014",,"With suffrage secured in 1920, feminists faced the challenge of how to keep their momentum going. As the center of the movement shrank, a small, self-appointed vanguard of âmodernâ women carried the cause forward in life and work. Feminism as Lifeâs Work profiles four of these women: the author Inez Haynes Irwin, the historian Mary Ritter Beard, the activist Doris Stevens, and Lorine Pruette, a psychologist. Their life-stories, told here in full for the first time, embody the changes of the first four decades of the twentieth century-and complicate what we know of the period. Through these womenâs intertwined stories, Mary Trigg traces the changing nature of the womenâs movement across turbulent decades rent by world war, revolution, global depression, and the rise of fascism. Criticizing the standard division of feminist activism as a series of historical waves, Trigg exposes how Irwin, Beard, Stevens, and Pruette helped push the U.S. feminist movement to victory and continued to propel it forward from the 1920s to the 1960s, decades not included in the âwaveâ model. At a time widely viewed as the âdoldrumsâ of feminism, the women in this book were in fact taking the cause to new sites: the National Womenâs Party; sexuality and relations with men; marriage; and work and financial independence. In their utopian efforts to reshape work, sexual relations, and marriage, modern feminists ran headlong into the harsh realities of male power, the sexual double standard, the demands of motherhood, and gendered social structures. In Feminism as Lifeâs Work, Irwin, Beard, Stevens, and Pruette emerge as the heirs of the suffrage movement, guardians of a long feminist tradition, and catalysts of the belief in equality and difference. Theirs is a story of courage, application, and perseverance-a story that revisits the âbleak and lonely yearsâ of the U.S. womenâs movement and emerges with a fresh perspective of the history of this pivotal era.

(1979",The effect of sex role differences on the societal reaction to mental retardation.,"Investigates the thesis that sex role definitions in the US support a double standard in societal reactions to mental incompetence. Role expectations for women are such that females are generally expected to be less competent than males in a variety of instrumental tasks, although perhaps more expressive. Males in turn are expected to be more active and aggressive than females in their exercise of the greater power and responsibility ascribed to them. In light of these generalized expectations it is suggested that incompetence in instrumental fields is more disturbing when demonstrated by males, and it is hypothesized that societal reactions to the mental deficiencies of males are more prompt and severe. This hypothesis is supported with evidence (from data reported to the US Public Health Service by public and private institutions for the retarded) suggesting that mentally retarded males are more likely to be institutionalized than retarded females and that males tend to be institutionalized at earlier ages and for milder disorders. Data are consistent with previously reported data on mental illness (W. Tudor et al; see record 1978-10042-001). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1105

This study applies multilevel models to Demographic and Health Survey data collected during 2003-2008 in 20 sub-Saharan African countries to examine the influence of social and cultural context on involvement with multiple sexual partnerships in the region, above and beyond the effects of individual characteristics. The findings provide support for the ecological argument that health behaviours are shaped and determined by societal conditions, in addition to the effects of individual and household characteristics. Involvement with multiple sex partners is most prevalent in societies in which sexual norms are widely permissive and where polygyny is common. Individual autonomy is substantial and attitudes towards sexuality are more liberal among men and women who live in communities in which sexual norms are widely permissive. Men and women who are most likely to have multiple sex partners in the sub-Saharan region are those who initiated sexual activity earlier and those who have the individual attributes (e.g. young age, urban residence, education, media exposure and working for cash and away from home) that bring to them more rights and/or decision-making autonomy, but not necessarily more financial resources and economic security (mostly among women). On the other hand, involvement with multiple partners is determined by cultural norms (i.e. permissive sexual norms) and social change (i.e. mass education, expansion of cash employment). The findings suggest a number of opportunities for more effective policy and programmatic responses to curb the prevalence of multiple partnerships in sub-Saharan Africa.

All literature collected pertained to efficacy in humans, dosing, precautions, adverse effects, use in pregnancy/lactation, interactions, alteration of laboratory assays, and mechanisms of action. Standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria are utilized for selection. Grades were assigned using an evidence-based grading rationale. Results: The review found that there was limited high-quality human evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of carrageenan.

Most children exposed to opioids and other medications in utero develop neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), yet individual predisposition for NAS is poorly understood. This investigation examined the role of neonatal sex in the postnatal period for neonates exposed to standardized opioid maintenance treatment in utero with a focus on NAS regarding severity, medication requirements, and duration. This was a secondary analysis of data collected in a prospective randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter trial (MOTHER study) that examined the comparative safety and efficacy of methadone and buprenorphine during pregnancy. A total of 131 neonates born to opioid-dependent women randomized at 6 US sites (n = 74) and 1 European site (n = 37) were analyzed. Sex-based differences in birth weight, length, head circumference, NAS duration, NAS severity, and treatment parameters of full-term neonates were assessed. Males had a significantly higher birth weight (P = 0.027) and head circumference (P = 0.017) compared with females, with no significant sex difference in rates of preterm delivery. No significant sex-related differences were found for NAS development, severity, or duration, or medication administered, and there were no significant differences in concomitant drug consumption during pregnancy (P = 0.959). This unique prospective study shows similar postnatal vulnerability for both sexes, suggesting that factors other than sex are the major determinants of clinically significant NAS.

1110,"Utriainen, S. (1989",Adolescent pregnancy: standards and services in Finland.,"Finland's adolescent pregnancy rate is lower than that of many comparable nations. The author examines Finnish standards and services on adolescent pregnancy, and results of a survey of adolescent sexual behaviors and attitudes. Finland's adolescent pregnancy rate is lower than that of many comparable nations. Finnish standards and services on adolescent pregnancy and results of a survey of adolescent sexual behaviors and attitudes are examined and compared to similar Standards for Services of Pregnant Adolescents and Young Parents by the Child Welfare League of America. Services for pregnant adolescents, young parents and children in Finland are part of the general services provided for families and children. Standard setting is principally by legislation of Parliament and complemented by presidential decrees approved by the Council of State. National Boards contribute to this process. Since the Major amendments to the Act of the Termination of Pregnancy in 1970, incidence of adolescent pregnancies has fallen by 18-29% in the age groups 15-19, and terminations by 4 to 16%. This trend is attributed to improved sex education and liberalization of attitudes towards contraceptive use. Surveys of teenagers in 5th grade (11-12 years) and in the 1st year of high school (16-17 years) covering approximately 2600 adolescents reveals this group thinks sex is important; it is more important to boys than girls. 1/2 of 13-year olds believe at last one of their friends has been petting and l/5 that a friend has had intercourse; for 15 year olds, the respective figures are 1/2 and 1/3. 60% of 17 year olds thought a friend has done both. Kissing behavior typically starts at age 13; but caressing or petting usually starts between age 15-16. Masturbation is little discussed but is an important and necessary part of maturation. Over 1/2 of the respondents felt sexual intercourse and love belong together but many felt intercourse without love was acceptable. 20% of the boys age 13-15 had dated and 30% in age 17; for boys the percents were 17,30 and 40. At age 13, 8% of boys and 3% of girls had had intercourse, rising to 18% and 23% at age 15 and to 46% and 49% by age 17. About 1/5 of 15 year olds and 1/2 of 17 year olds are sexually active, however, the survey repeated their knowledge about prevention of pregnancy is inadequate. Pregnancy risk factors include coming from large families, conflict in the family, divorce, alcoholism, economic difficulties, permanent sickness of parents or siblings, and general helplessness. Services include health care at schools, pregnancy resolution counseling, abortion, adoption, establishment of paternity, maternity clinics, hospitalization and postpartum care. author's modified",0,1110

1112,"Vampo, C. (2018",Female business leaders and young female entrepreneurs in lomé (Togo): The double life of “superwomen” and their domestic burdens.,"Research Framework: Togo is a country with a strong trade tradition and a high female labor participation rate. Women are encouraged to become entrepreneurs and they are free to make use of their revenue. At the same time, they bear a heavier burden than men in terms of work/ life balance since they are responsible for virtually all domestic work. While most women are confined to informal sectors of activity, some businesswomen in LomÃ© have managed to be active in emerging areas of the formal economy. This investigation is about the women who seem to be an archetype for women emancipating themselves through work. These are the women who studied at universities and belong to associations that promote female entrepreneurship and empowerment. Objectives: The article explores the way these women fit within the gendered division of labor. It investigates the tools women use to manage everyday lives filled with familial constraints and professional obligations. Methodology: This study is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in LomÃ© over five years. A micro-analysis of gender relations was applied to reveal the trajectories of success in these female entrepreneurs by taking a relational approach. The empirical material was gathered using interviews and observations in and outside of businesses, as well as informal discussions and through the use of a questionnaire about expenses and tasks. Results: The results show that the work/family balance is seen as the duty of married women. The most common solution to this problem is transferring the care work to other women at home and at their places of work. Conclusions: The study highlights that women adhere to the gendered division of labor because of social standards regarding marriage and due to issues of social recognition associated with the female reproductive role. The businesswomen of LomÃ© may be regarded as âsuperwomenâ however, to reach this brass ring, they must shift some of their burden onto other women. Contribution: The fact that women have access to high responsibility jobs hasn't completely changed traditional gendered roles. The reconfiguration of gender relations depends on the economic empowerment of women. However, the social negotiation of a company manager's status is made by transgressing gender norms but also by perpetuating the inequality of order. This article invites us to see empowerment as a sociopolitical process which is both individual and collective. Â© 2018 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS. All rights reserved.",0,1112

(2005","Christian Students and Premarital Sex: Definition, Moral Standards and Erotofobia-Erotofilia Dimension of Personality.","Sexual morality among Christian students is a topic much discussed but less a topic of research. The ancient standard 'premarital sex is not allowed' seems to be disappearing. Is that truly the case? And how is 'sex' defined? In this research a number of questions around the definition and moral standard of sexuality are presented to Christian students. Their erotofilia was also inquired after. The research-group consisted of 285 adolescents, age 18 to 27, with a mean age of 21.5, all in higher education or university. 'Sex' was defined as intercourse by the majority of the respondents, as was orally or manually having contact with genitals. The same amount of people disapproved of this behaviour before marriage. A big influence seemed to be having or not having a relationship. The people with a relationship at the time of questioning seemed to have a much more permissive moral standard then did the ones without a relationship. The people who did have a relationship before, had a moral standard which was in between that of the two former groups. Being confronted with the practice of sexual behaviour seems to influence the permissiveness of the moral standard, especially in the 'grey' area in between deep kissing and having intercourse. Deep kissing is allowed for, while having intercourse is not. This seems to be the only moral standard on which Christian adolescents agree. Christian students seem to be much more erotofobic then their non-Christian fellow students. This could possibly be more adaptive then negative. More erotofobic people tend to seek sexual stimuli, which can be convenient in keeping your moral standards. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1113

Celebrity sex and the framing of the moral high ground.,"For media and audiences fascinated with celebrities' private lives, insight into their sexual behaviour is the ultimate pleasure as it deals with the most intimate details, the 'real' behind the celebrity construct. A celebrity's sex life is not just food for gossip but may facilitate the articulation of moral, ethical and social views on sexual issues in contemporary society. This is analysed by means of a framing analysis of celebrity sex stories and audience reactions in a sample of three celebrity websites (Flemish HLN, British Heat, and American People). Results reveal that media and readers focus on only a few, highly 'scandalous' stories of married heterosexual men's adultery. While media in their framing of celebrity news refrain from explicit judgments, readers are eager to openly criticise celebrities' adulterous transgressions while taking the moral high ground. Focusing on adultery, seven frames relating to different views in society were found, presenting adultery in either sociological, biological, psychological or religious terms. Only the 'women's fault' frame supports the sexual double standard, claiming women are responsible for a man's adultery.1. Â© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",0,1114

Results show that restrictive guidance led to a reduction of media consumption, whereas other forms of guidance did not. Restriction of the use of 1 medium was associated with increases in another medium offering a similar gratification. Ss' perceived differences between the guidance behavior of fathers and mothers. Parental guidance as measured as verbal cues affected media consumption of girls only.

(2010","HIV/AIDS and the gendering of stigma in Tamil Nadu, South India.","Drawing on the seminal theoretical work on stigma by Goffman, this article analyzes stigma through the lens of Parker and Aggleton, who call for the joining of Goffman and Foucault to better grasp relationships among stigma, power and social inequality. Studies on the social impact of HIV/AIDS globally have demonstrated that women tend to be blamed for the spread of HIV/AIDS, and as a result, HIV-positive women face greater stigma and discrimination than HIV-positive men. Based on ethnographic research among 50 HIV-positive women in South India in 2002-2003 and 2004, my research supports this standard argument. However, my findings suggest that the gendering of stigma and discrimination is more complex and context specific. The gendering of stigma varies depending on the social context of private versus public spheres. The tendency to stigmatize women is due in part to cultural constructions of gendered bodies and not only to a gendered double standard of sexual morality, as has been previously reported. Even when a cultural argument about women's wayward sexuality is evoked, this rhetoric must be understood in part as a strategy to mask economically motivated responses, rather simply being attributed to sexist ideology per se.

However, despite the fact that the novel is centred on a pregnancy and subsequent abortion, gender issues have barely been addressed in relation to the novel. This article argues that social issues which disproportionately affected women, such as the hypocritical double standards of sexual morality, the rigid gender roles prescribed by the regime and womenâs lack of control over their own reproductive rights, are in the foreground of GarcÃ­a Hortelanoâs novel. By depicting these issues in his novel, the author drew the readerâs attention to some of the consequences of Francoist Spainâs patriarchal social values.

(2013",Male androphilia in the ancestral environment: An ethnological analysis.,"The kin selection hypothesis posits that male androphilia (male sexual attraction to adult males) evolved because androphilic males invest more in kin, thereby enhancing inclusive fitness. Increased kin-directed altruism has been repeatedly documented among a population of transgendered androphilic males, but never among androphilic males in other cultures who adopt gender identities as men. Thus, the kin selection hypothesis may be viable if male androphilia was expressed in the transgendered form in the ancestral past. Using the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), we examined 46 societies in which male androphilia was expressed in the transgendered form (transgendered societies) and 146 comparison societies (non-transgendered societies). We analyzed SCCS variables pertaining to ancestral sociocultural conditions, access to kin, and societal reactions to homosexuality. Our results show that ancestral sociocultural conditions and bilateral and double descent systems were more common in transgendered than in non-transgendered societies. Across the entire sample, descent systems and residence patterns that would presumably facilitate increased access to kin were associated with the presence of ancestral sociocultural conditions. Among transgendered societies, negative societal attitudes toward homosexuality were unlikely. We conclude that the ancestral human sociocultural environment was likely conducive to the expression of the transgendered form of male androphilia. Descent systems, residence patterns, and societal reactions to homosexuality likely facilitated investments in kin by transgendered males. Given that contemporary transgendered male androphiles appear to exhibit elevated kin-directed altruism, these findings further indicate the viability of the kin selection hypothesis.

At 15, heavy petting and coitus with 2 or more partners also demonstrated significant increases. It is noted that statements regarding changes in adolescent sexual activity must specify the level of sexuality under consideration. To use change in coital activity as the sole indicator of change in other levels of sexuality is apparently unjustified. Findings indicate that the new morality is not limited to sexuality, but extends to the broader context of youthful behavior. High correlations were found between sexuality and the use of illicit drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. Heavy involvement in sexual activity was also related to other delinquent acts, as well as to the lack of commitment to traditional institutions. By age 17, the impact of the double standard becomes attenuated. At this age an equivalent percentage of boys and girls reported having experienced coitus.

Design: Single-center, four-period, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Setting: Maastricht University, The Netherlands. Participants: Forty healthy volunteers (20 females). Interventions: Single dose of ZST administered in the middle of the night at 3 and 4 h before driving, zopiclone 7.5 mg at bedtime 9 h before driving, and placebo. Measurements: Performance in a 100-km standardized highway driving test in normal traffic measuring standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP)-an index of weaving. Drug-placebo changes in SDLP > 2.5 cm were considered to reflect clinically relevant driving impairment. Result: For ZST, Max McNemar symmetry analyses showed that the proportion of drivers classified as impaired was increased 3 h after dosing (P < 0.012), but not 4 h after dosing. Mean increases in SDLP from placebo, although statistically significant, were small (1.46 cm [P < 0.0001] at 3 h and 0.83 cm [P = 0.0174] at 4 h). The morning after zopiclone, 45% of the drivers were classified as impaired with a mean increase in SDLP of 2.46 cm (P < 0.0001).

Secondly, an attempt was made to establish the usefulness of this instrument in predicting academic success in a high-risk collegiate population. The 75 item instrument was administered twice to voluntary, first year students enrolled in a developmental education program at a state university. Scale reliabilities ranging from.74 to.90 were established that are slightly higher, though roughly equivalent to those reported by the instrument's authors. Factorial validity was established through confirmatory factor analysis of the covariance of scale scores to the authors proposed three factor structure. Model modification indices provided by VMS-LISERL 7.16 (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1984) software indicate that the scale ""Quality of Attention"" double loads on both the Emotional and Behavioral factors rather than just on the Behavioral as proposed by the authors. Regression analyses conducted indicate that the SAT accounts for very little of the variance in prediction of academic success in this population, while the TRAC accounts for approximately 21% of the variance in FGPA and 17% in SPGPA. Differences are seen between sexes with women having significantly higher mean scores on scales associated with the Behavioral factor and men having higher scores on the Belief factor scales.

A total of 53 professionals and 47 residents from five RACFs located in Catalonia, Spain, were asked to reflect upon what they would think and do if they entered the bedroom of a resident and found him or her having sex with another resident of the opposite gender. The results suggest that male-female partnered sexual activity would generally be considered acceptable and would be respected, although some respondents called into question the appropriateness of such behavior and stated that they would react in a restrictive way. Overall, professionals appeared to be more accepting and permissive than were residents. Although our findings are broadly optimistic, they also suggest that male-female sexual intercourse may be considered an unwelcome sexual practice by some residents and professionals even if it occurs in a private space within the RACF. The fact that both staff and residents may also react in a negative way to the event could constitute a barrier to sexual expression among institutionalized older people.

They provide rare access to sexual values, norms and expectations of groups that often did not leave many written traces. In this case study, insults, extracted from a series of Antwerp local police records, are used to reconstruct the conceptions of sexuality of the lower social groups. The analysis shows that among these groups, there is definitely no complete correspondence with the official views on sexuality. During the first half of the twentieth century, a far greater variety of views existed among the Antwerp population than one would assume based on the unequivocal character of the official sexual discourse. The existence of contrary traditions, diametrically opposed to more broadly shared views, indicates that the sexual value pattern of the lower social groups was not monolithic either. The double standard regarding men's and women's sexuality was a common element between the official sexual ideology and the views expressed in the insults. A complete convergence of the notions of male and female sexual honour was certainly not the case. Women's sexual honour was scrutinised far more heavily than men's. The definition of women as essentially sexual beings was not exclusively the work of men, but was confirmed with even greater insistence by women themselves. The double standard did not have an absolute character; women attacked men too in their sexual honour.

(2018",Governing in the Name of Caring—the Nordic Model of Prostitution and its Punitive Consequences for Migrants Who Sell Sex.,"This article examines the so-called âNordic modelâ in action. Using feminist argumentation, the model aims to abolish commercial sex by criminalizing the buying of sexual services while not criminalizing the selling, as the aim is to protect, rather than punish, women. Utilizing over 2 years of ethnographic fieldwork and 195 interviews in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, this article argues that in a situation where the majority of people who sell sex in the region are migrants, the regulation of commercial sex has shifted from prostitution to immigration policies, resulting in a double standard in the governance of national and foreign sellers of sexual services. Client criminalization has a minor role in the regulation of commercial sex in the area, and instead, migrants become targets of punitive regulation executed through immigration and third-party laws. Nationals are provided social welfare policies to assist exit from commercial sex such as therapeutic counseling, whereas foreigners are excluded from state services and targeted with punitive measures, like deportations and evictions. My fieldwork reveals a tension between the stated feminist-humanitarian aims of the model, to protect and save women, and the punitivist governance of commercial sex that in practice leads to control, deportations, and womenâs conditions becoming more difficult. The article concludes that when examined in action, the Nordic model is a form of humanitarian governance that I call punitivist humanitarianism, or governing in the name of caring.

1134,"Crow, L. D. and A. Crow (1956",Sex behavior of adolescents.,"Adolescent sexual adjustment constitutes a personal and social problem that begins early in adolescence and continues as a potent force during this period. Often there is conflict between adult standards and evolved adolescent codes of behavior pertaining to dating, petting, mate selection, courtship, and premarital or extramarital sexual intercourse. The achievement by young people of culturally acceptable attitudes toward their developing sex urges is a major problem not only for the adolescents themselves but for parents, school personnel, religious leaders, and workers in social and welfare agencies. The current increase of delinquency among young teen-agers, including sex experimentation and rape, is alerting thoughtful adults and adolescents to the needs of boys and girls during their growing-up years to be helped toward an understanding of the role of sex in an individual's life and the development of wholesome patterns of sex-stimulated behavior. Chapter 4 dealt with the physical and physiological aspects of sexual growth and maturational processes during adolescence. We now shall consider, in terms of recent research findings, the development of adolescent sex-stimulated attitudes and behavior in relation to societal sex restrictions and taboos.

We describe measures of sexual partnerships, sexual practices, sexual problems, attitudes toward sex, and nonsexual intimacy in the first wave of NSHAP. Methods: We compare measures of sexuality for those 57-85 years old, by age, separately for men and women. We construct scales of sexual mores, sexual interest, and relationship satisfaction and discuss properties of each scale. Results: Sexuality among older adults tends to vary with age and gender. At all ages in this study, men are more likely than women to have a partner, more likely to be sexually active with that partner, and tend to have more positive and permissive attitudes toward sex. The proportions in a sexual partnership, behavior, problems, and attitudes all differ substantially by age. And these age patterns often differ for men and women. Discussion: Data obtained in the NSHAP can be used to construct key measures of sexuality among older adults; to examine sexuality itself; and to explore the link between sexuality, health, well-being, and other dimensions of the lives of older adults.

(2009",Neonatal lipopolysaccharide and adult stress exposure predisposes rats to anxiety-like behaviour and blunted corticosterone responses: Implications for the double-hit hypothesis.,"The double-hit hypothesis posits that an early life genetic or environmental insult sets up a neural predisposition to psychopathology, which may emerge in the presence of a subsequent insult, or 'second hit' in later life. The current study assessed the effect of neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure on anxiety-like behaviours in the adult Wistar rat. Rats were administered either LPS (Salmonella enterica, serotype enteritidis, 0.05mg/kg, ip) or saline (equivolume) on days 3 and 5 of life (birth=day 1). In adulthood (85 days), subjects were allocated to either ""stress"" or ""no stress"" treatment groups. For the ""stress"" group, subjects were exposed to a three-day stress protocol consisting of a 30 min period of restraint and isolation. The ""no stress"" group was left unperturbed but were handled during this period to control for handling effects between adult ""stress"" and ""no stress"" conditions. All animals then underwent behavioural testing using standardised tests of anxiety-like behaviour, including either the Hide Box/Open Field, Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) or Acoustic Startle Response (ASR). Time and event measures for restraint and isolation, the Hide Box/Open Field and EPM were recorded using automated tracking software. Startle amplitude and habituation across time was measured in the ASR test. Prior to and following behavioural test sessions, peripheral blood was collected to assess serum corticosterone and ACTH levels. Data analysis indicated that LPS-treated animals exposed to stress in adulthood exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviour across all behavioural tests compared to controls. Sexually dimorphic effects were observed with males exhibiting increased anxiety-related behaviours compared to females (p <.05). Neonatal LPS exposure induced a significant increase in corticosterone compared to controls (p <.05), whereas corticosterone responses to stress in adulthood were associated with a significantly blunted HPA axis response (p <.05). No differences in ACTH were observed. These results lend support to the double-hit hypothesis of anxiety-related behaviour, demonstrating that neonatal immune activation produces an enhanced propensity toward anxiety-related behaviour following stress in adulthood, and that this susceptibility is associated with alterations to HPA axis ontogeny.

Method: college students (N = 388) at a midsized northeastern public university were assessed during the summer before matriculation and during the spring semesters of their freshman and sophomore years. A recently developed mixed model for analyzing longitudinal response patterns with predominating zeros was employed to examine categorical transitions (binary portion) and growth (intensity portion). Results: As expected, there were strong effects of time reflected in both the binary and intensity portions of the models across the three outcomes (weekly alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol-related problems). parental permissiveness of drinking and student intention to affiliate with fraternity/sorority organizations predicted the transition to use and consequence status for all three outcomes and for increases in alcohol use and consequences. peer disapproval of drinking strongly predicted all alcohol use and consequence outcomes. parental disapproval of heavy drinking, parental monitoring, and male gender were variably influential across the outcomes at low to moderate levels. Conclusions: our findings indicate the importance of the parental context (e.g., parental permissiveness of drinking) as well as peer influences (e.g., intended fraternity/sorority involvement) in drinking behavior among college students.

1138,"Walters, L. H. and C. Abshire (2010",Single parenthood and the law.,"There are many implications for both practice and policy that can be drawn from this discussion; however, one is particularly important. In this time of evolving family forms and merging sex roles, it is easy to be distracted from serious, ongoing problems of single-parent families. We have discovered that fathers can be nurturant and some want custody of children following divorce. Grandparents are asserting their rights to visit and even to have custody of grandchildren. Gay and lesbian persons are seeking ways to fulfill their desire to parent. Foster and adoptive parents push for their rights as psychological parents of children they love and have cared for. All these are important issues and deserve careful thought and study. The fact remains, however, that the vast majority of single parents are women. Their lives are shaped by myths and stereotypes that even they often do not recognize-they hold many of the stereotypes themselves. They are poor, often educationally unprepared to work for an adequate wage, and believe that they should be at home to care for their children. Decisions are made about their lives by people who feel that they should be good mothers and stay home with their children while, at the same time, believing that they should be hard workers and support themselves. The double standard that is held for men and women following divorce is well documented at every step of the legal process. Although ""best interest of the child"" has emerged as the dominant guiding principle for law-making and court decisions that affect single parent families, it is our observation that before the interests of children can be well served, it will be necessary to resolve conflicting feelings and beliefs and recognize that we must also promote the best interest of the parent. To maximize the effectiveness of either practice or policy, it will be necessary to set aside myths and stereotypes and address the issue of equality. When we understand what we mean by equality, we will be able-without regard to gender-to educate children to assume the variety of roles that are required to function well as a single parent or a dual parent When we start from the assumption that every individual should be prepared to function well in both instrumental and expressive roles, policy and practice will not be so heavily colored by myths and stereotypes. Until we achieve this goal, we can make progress by questioning our assumptions with every decision that is made regarding a single-parent family. Not only will such a process improve the conditions of single-mother families, it will enable us to think more constructively and clearly about emerging forms of single-parent families.

1141,"Wang, W. (2008",Sexually transmitted infections and risky sexual behaviors among Chinese adults.,"Background. Human behavior changes resulting from the substantial social and economic development in China have profound effect on the rising epidemic of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Data and methods. This study is a secondary analysis of data from Chinese Health and Family Life Survey. Prevalence of three STIs, Chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis are estimated. Proximate determinants of STIs are assessed. Two important proximate determinants, concurrent sexual behavior and condom use are explored further. Two-level random intercept logistic regression and regular logistic regression are fitted to determine the effect of risk factors. Results. The overall prevalence of STIs was 3.9% for women and 2.4% for men. Chlamydia is the most prevalent infection, with the prevalence of 2.6% in women and 2.1% in men. In women, whose primary partners socialized more frequently (OR, 1.52; 95% CI: 1.10-2.11) and who perceived primary partners have had concurrent sexual partners (OR, 2.40; CI: 1.62-3.56) have greater risk of being infected. In Men, higher risk of infection is associated with socializing more frequently (OR, 2.07; 95% CI: 1.22-3.52) having concurrent sex partners (OR, 1.87; 95% CI: 1.12-3.10) and engaging in unprotected sex with commercial sex workers (OR, 2.42; 95% CI: 1.20-4.85). Concurrent sexual behavior is more common among men than women, particularly in younger age groups. Individuals who perceived primary partners have had other concurrent sexual partners are more likely to engage in concurrent sexual behavior. More permissive community attitudes towards extramarital sex are shown as a risk factor of men's engagement in concurrent sexual behavior. The consistent condom use rate in men with primary partner is 2.4%, but 32.9% with casual partners. Better educational attainment increases men's condom use with both primary and casual partners. Living in a community where there is prevailing traditional gender norm is associated with less report of consistent condom use. Conclusion. There is hidden epidemic of Chlamydia among Chinese general population. Men are transmitting infections to their primary partners acquired through sex with casual partners or commercial sex workers. Concurrent sexual behavior is influenced by factors operating at multiple levels. Condom use in Chinese men is partner-specific. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1141

METHODS: Data were analyzed from 245 freshmen enrolled in a school-based abstinence-only-until-marriage program. Two binary logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with intentions to engage in intercourse before marriage and within the next year. RESULTS: Approximately 21% and 14% of participants reported intentions to have intercourse. Respondents participated in 2.2 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.2) extracurricular activities. Freshmen who were male, perceived their friends to approve of premarital sex, and consumed alcohol were more likely to report intentions to have intercourse. For every additional extracurricular activity in which freshmen participated, they were less likely to report intentions to have intercourse within the next year (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as extracurricular activities provide youth with opportunities to build supportive relationships, connect with peers and role models, and positively engage in schools and communities. Extracurricular activities typically already exist, have funding, and are generally well-supported. School-based strategies can increase teenagers' autonomy by providing a variety of activities to participate in and reduce unsupervised time. This, in turn, has the potential to decrease sexual risk taking behaviors. Â© 2016, American School Health Association",0,1145

The purpose of this two phase research study was to better understand the socio-ecologic context of HIV prevention for rural-to-urban migrant female garment factory workers in Cambodia. Methods. The research used a mixed methods exploratory sequential design. Phase one consisted of interviews with migrant garment factory workers and key informants, and focus group interviews with health care providers about the women's migration experience and factors affecting HIV prevention. Phase two was a cross-sectional survey of health care providers (doctors, nurses, midwives, and pharmacists) about their HIV knowledge and attitudes, and their intentions to take a sexual history from migrant garment workers using constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The qualitative data were analyzed by comparison of the key themes discussed by the participant groups, while the quantitative survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multiple linear regression of the TPB constructs. Results. Migrant women garment factory workers were at risk of HIV infection because of both economic and social vulnerability. These women migrated in order to support their poor families financially. They worked long hours in factories, sending a large proportion of their income home. Despite overall good knowledge about HIV transmission, there was a spectrum of discourses on condom use in relationships: many women maintained that their partners refused to wear condoms, or the women did not discuss the issue of condom use with their partner. Cambodian health care providers were generally knowledgeable about HIV transmission, although attitudes about people with HIV were not always positive. The TPB constructs explained 55.5% of the variance in generalized intention to take a sexual history; the construct of perceived behavioural controls was the strongest contributor at 50.6%, subjective norms contributed 2.8%, and attitudes construct was non-significant. Conclusions. There were multiple, contextual factors that put migrant women garment factory workers in Cambodia at risk for HIV: gender norms promoting a sexual double standard, AIDS stigma limiting condom use, and limitations in access to health care were predominant themes. These important issues should be considered in the development of interventions to improve HIV prevention for these migrant garment factory workers.

Improvements in mean MADRS total score during the double-blind phase favored adjunctive aripiprazole treatment from 1-2 weeks onward, with per-protocol subgroup analyses showing that mean changes were not affected by the specific standard antidepressant therapy used, age or sex of the patient or the mean MADRS total scores at the start of double-blind adjunctive therapy. In general, secondary endpoint scores, including those for the Sheehan Disability Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement scale and CGI Severity of Illness scale, improved to a significantly greater extent with adjunctive aripiprazole than with adjunctive placebo treatment, with significantly higher response and remission rates in the aripiprazole groups.

Analysis focuses on ""uncouth"" outbursts of aggression--on collectively agreed statements about others that were surprising and disquieting in the relaxed, permissive context of research interview and discussion.

One hundred fifty two surveys were administered, of which one hundred twenty-four (81.6%) were completed. Results of this study suggested most of the respondents of Illinois residents agreed that sexuality education and counseling services should be available to adults with intellectual disabilities. The exception was in the permissiveness of masturbation training, in which slightly more than half of respondents held permissive attitudes. Most of the respondents of Illinois residents agreed that the individual sexual practice of private masturbation and use of adult erotic materials should be permitted in a residential facility. A majority of the respondents agreed that all eight of the measured behaviors of supervisor dating, unsupervised dating, hand holding, hugging, brief kissing, prolonged kissing, fondling, and intimate sexual relations should be permitted behaviors for both opposite gender partners and same gender partners. The results suggested that only the respondent characteristic of highest level of education significantly predicted degree of permissiveness toward opposite gender partner and same gender partner sexual behavior.

We synthesize the literature on HIV and water/sanitation to develop a conceptual model that maps the connections between women's double burden of resource collection and HIV care. Drawing on theories of gender and systems science, we posit that there are multiple paths through which improved water/sanitation could improve HIV-related outcomes.

Wexberg examines painstakingly a wide array of relationships between individuals of the opposite sexes in pairs and groups. He shows that the attitudes, drives, and inhibitions are not biological facts, but trends developed under social influences, and are psychologically explicable. Adolescent attitudes, climacteric behavior characteristics, marital and extra-marital relationships are considered in turn. The varied influences upon attitudes and behavior of the social traditions centering on the double moral and social standards are especially stressed as forming the bases for the serious but avoidable sex conflicts of the present day. Proper sex education of adults as well as of youth, looking to the development of healthier social standards, is urged as the real need of the day. Sex education is not a separable subject matter or an isolable sphere of activity, but is rather a problem of the fundamental social attitudes of any individual.

Pathak (2010",Masculinity and relationship agreements among male same-sex couples.,"Extradyadic sex is a significant source of risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among men in same-sex relationships. Nonmonogamous sexual agreements are common among male same-sex couples and may serve as effective targets for risk reduction interventions; however, there is a dearth of research reporting on the social and cultural determinants of explicit nonmonogamous agreements. In this study, it was hypothesized that attitudes toward dominant cultural standards of masculinity (i.e., normative masculinity) would be associated with the types of sexual agreements negotiated among gay male couples. An Internet-based survey was used to collect data from 931 men for this analysis. Results indicated that men who reported high endorsement of normative masculinity were more likely to be in nonmonogamous relationships. Furthermore, high endorsement of normative masculinity was predictive of relationship agreements characterized as the most sexually permissive. These findings indicate that rather than simply predicting nonmonogamy in gay male couples, attitudes toward masculinity may be indirectly related to increased risk of STIs by influencing the types of sexual agreements negotiated. This is the first empirical study to emphasize the role of masculinity as an explanatory factor of same-sex relationship agreements.

The authors ran panels for each predictor variable when controlling only for family structure, pubertal development, gender and grade level to assess changes in influence of individual predictors across time. A full model consisting of all statistically significant predictor variables and interactions was then run to determine the most influential predictors across time. Results show significant decrease in the effect of mother monitoring by 10th grade. It is suggested that poor parent-child relationships have greater effects on timing of first intercourse than do positive parent-child relationships. The authors also found significant interactions for gender: time devoted to school activities and homework delayed becoming sexually active for young women but not young men. Similarly, girls who experienced depressed affect were more likely than boys to become sexually active. Results for the full model show that when controlling for all other influences, the primary predictors of early intercourse were age, opportunity (being in steady relationship), sexually permissive attitudes, association with delinquent peers, and alcohol use.

At the same time, the BfM demanded legal equality for illegitimate children, the decriminalization of abortion and the right of women to sue for divorce. In raising these issues, the BfM trod on difficult ground since they were not 'popular' topics of discussion within German society around the turn-of-the-century. The chairwoman of the BfM, Helene StÃ¶cker, who was among the first women to study and obtain a doctorate in Germany, put the Society's ideas into practice in her relationship of 'free love and marriage' with her partner, the lawyer Bruno Springer. Indeed, it was the policy of the BfM to encourage progressive men to join the organization and work in partnership with the women, while most of the other groups on the radical wing of the bourgeois women's movement chose to work autonomously from men. Over the years, the BfM's priorities changed and its members moved in different directions: while the 'moderates' wanted to retain the family as the nucleus of the state, the more radical members went in search of new forms of relationship, attempting thereby to expose society's double standard of morality.

1163,"Widman, D. R., et al. (2018",Punishment of hypothetical polygamous marriages.,"Parental investment theory suggests that differential reproductive investment has led the sexes to different mating strategies. In humans, men have the lesser investment and therefore tend to desire greater numbers of mates relative to women. One result of this could be that men would be more tolerant of polygamous marriages. The present study examined this hypothesis. Participants read 4 hypothetical vignettes describing individuals who were convicted of polygamy. The vignettes varied in the sex of the perpetrator and whether the marriage resulted in children or not. Participants were asked to suggest a sentence duration and to assess the severity of that sentence, as well as the severity of the transgression to the spouses, the institution of marriage, and in general. Participants also completed several scales relevant to reproduction. The results indicated that women assigned greater sentence durations and perceived the transgressions toward the institution of marriage and in general as more severe than men. In addition, the presence of children increased the troublesomeness of the polygamy. Finally, life history and the troublesomeness of the polygamy were positively correlated, but only in men. This is consistent with the male strategy of dads with slow life histories and cads with fast life histories. The lack of correlation in women may be an indication of smaller variation in reproduction relative to men, regardless of life history. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement-Men punished hypothetical polygamists less harshly than women. This result is consistent with parental investment theory that states men desire a greater number of sexual partners than women because of their lower obligate investment in offspring. The punishment, however, was tempered by the presence of children; both men and women punished more harshly when the polygamous marriage produced children.

(2013",Sexual dimorphism in digital dermatoglyphic traits among Sinhalese people in Sri Lanka.,"Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate gender-wise diversity of digital dermatoglyphic traits in a sample of Sinhalese people in Sri Lanka.Findings: Four thousand and thirty-four digital prints of 434 Sinhalese individuals (217 males and 217 females) were examined for their digital dermatoglyphic pattern distribution. The mean age for the entire group was 23.66 years (standard deviation = 4.93 years). The loop pattern is observed more frequently (n = 2,592, 59.72%) compared to whorl (n = 1,542, 35.53%) and arch (n = 206, 4.75%) in the Sinhalese population. Females (n = 1,274, 58.71%) have a more ulnar loop pattern than males (n = 1,231, 56.73%). The plain whorl pattern is observed more frequently in males (n = 560, 25.81%) compared to females (n = 514, 23.69%).The double loop pattern is observed more frequently on the right and left thumb (digit 1) of both males and females. Pattern intensity index, Dankmeijer index and Furuhata index are higher in males.Conclusions: Ulnar loop is the most frequently occurring digital dermatoglyphic pattern among the Sinhalese. All pattern indices are higher in males. To some extent, dermatoglyphic patterns of Sinhalese are similar to North Indians and other Caucasoid populations. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to confirm our findings. Â© 2013 Wijerathne et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,1165

Self-esteem, health, and masculinity were positively related to body attitudes, but these relationships did not vary according to age or gender.

This theory claims that women feel more negatively than men about their body and physical appearance as they age. The second goal of this study was to examine variables that might mediate the relationship between aging and body attitudes, including the importance placed on physical appearance, masculinity, self-esteem, and perceived health status. To address these goals, men and women (N=144) ranging in age from 20 to 80 years completed measures of body attitudes, self-esteem, sex-role, and health. Additional measures of body attitudes were completed after awareness of the body was heightened. No support for the double standard of aging was found; there were no age, sex, or Age x Sex differences in body attitudes, even when awareness of the body was heightened. Women, however, believed that physical appearance was more important and engaged in more appearance-related behaviors than men. Consistent with predictions, masculinity, health, and self-esteem were related to body attitudes; however, the importance of these variables did not differ according to age or sex. Contrary to predictions, older adults who placed more importance on physical appearance did not have lower self-esteem than older adults who were less appearance-oriented. Finally, two post-hoc predictions were supported in part. Individuals with greater body mass had more negative body attitudes than those with lower body mass, but this relationship was not stronger among women. Additionally, exercise was related to body attitudes only among older women; older exercising women had greater body satisfaction than nonexercising older women.

Results of a qualitative study from Tunisia.,"Hymen reconstruction surgery (HR), while ethically controversial, is now available in many countries. Little clinical evidence and hardly any surgical standards support the intervention. Nearly as scarce is social science research exploring women's motivations for the intervention, and health care professionals' justifications for its provision. In order to better understand decision-making processes, we conducted semi-structured interviews in metropolitan Tunis, in 2009, with six women seeking the procedure, four friends who supported such women, four physicians who perform the operation, and one midwife. Health care professionals and patient companions expressed moral ambivalence about HR: although they could comprehend the individual situation of the women, they expressed concern that availability of the procedure might further entrench the patriarchal norms that compel the motivation for seeking HR in the first place. Some women seeking HR shared this concern, but felt it was not outweighed by their personal aims, which were to marry and become mothers, or to overcome past violent sexual experiences. The women felt HR to be uniquely helpful in achieving these aims; all made pragmatic decisions about their bodies in a social environment dominated by patriarchal norms. The link between HR and pervasive gender injustice, including the credible threat of serious social and physical harm to women perceived to have failed to uphold the norm of virginity before marriage, raises questions about health care professionals' responsibility while facing requests for HR. Meaningful regulatory guidance must acknowledge that these genuine harms are at stake; it must do so, however, without resorting to moral double standards. We recommend a reframing of HR as a temporary resource for some women making pragmatic choices in a context of structural gender injustice. We reconfirm the importance of factual sexual and reproductive education, most importantly to counter distorted beliefs that conflate an ""intact hymen"" with virginity.

I find that individuals who are HIV positive and have taken a standard HIV test are much more likely to engage in efforts to prevent HIV transmission than are individuals who are HIV negative and have taken a standard HIV test. Moreover, this difference is greater than the difference between HIV positives and HIV negatives for individuals who have not taken a standard HIV test. Consistent with an altruistic motivation, this double-difference is larger for individuals who are married than for individuals who are not married. These results appear to be the first evidence on the change in risky sexual behavior associated with HIV testing at scale and are consistent with altruism dominating any self-interested response to HIV testing.

Sass (2011",Healthy & Ready to Learn: Examining the Efficacy of an Early Approach to Obesity Prevention and School Readiness.,"The collision of the childhood obesity epidemic with pressure to achieve high academic standards is of serious concern in the United States. Growing numbers of low-income, minority children face double jeopardy as alarming obesity rates further widen existing achievement gaps. Health and education disparities persist when children enter kindergarten lacking fundamental school readiness skills and are also at risk of obesity. The goal of this study was to address serious gaps in research by examining the efficacy of an innovative program, Healthy & Ready to Learn, an early approach to obesity prevention and promotion of school readiness. The study targeted low-income, predominantly Latino preschoolers who are particularly at risk of health and educational disparities. The pretest-posttest, quasi-experimental study involved 405 children, ages 3 to 5 years, enrolled in four matched Head Start centers. To ensure rigorous assessment, the study used a battery of objective and validated instruments as direct measures of child outcomes. Using multilevel modeling, several linear growth models were conducted with participant's growth at Level-1 (i.e., time) and subject-level variables at Level-2 (i.e., treatment, gender, age, & body mass index classification) for each outcome variable of interest. Results revealed statistically significant improvements in growth (i.e., height), gross motor skills, physical activity levels, and receptive language development when comparing the treatment and control conditions. These promising results suggest that the Healthy & Ready to Learn program has potential as an early approach to improve children's health and, simultaneously, enhance their trajectory toward better academic performance.

We aim to develop robust estimates of disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) for ethnic groups in England and Wales in 2001 and to examine observed variations across ethnic groups.Design. DFLE and HLE by age and gender for five-year age groups were computed for 16 ethnic groups by combining the 2001 Census data on ethnicity, self-reported limiting long-term illness and self-rated health using mortality by ethnic group estimated by two methods: the Standardised Illness Ratio (SIR) method and the Geographically Weighted Method (GWM).Results. The SIR and GWM methods differed somewhat in their estimates of life expectancy (LE) at birth but produced very similar estimates of DFLE and HLE by ethnic group. For the more conservative method (GWM), the range in DFLE at birth was 10.5 years for men and 11.9 years for women, double that in LE. DFLE at birth was highest for Chinese men (64.7 years, 95% CI 64.0-65.3) and women (67.0 years, 95% CI 66.4-67.6). Over half of the ethnic minority groups (men: 10; women: 9) had significantly lower DFLE at birth than White British men (61.7 years, 95% CI 61.7-61.7) or women (64.1 years, 95% CI 64.1-64.2), mostly the Black, Asian and mixed ethnic groups. The lowest DFLE observed was for Bangladeshi men (54.3 years, 95% CI 53.7-54.8) and Pakistani women (55.1 years, 95% CI 54.8-55.4). Notable were Indian women whose LE was similar to White British women but who had 4.3 years less disability-free (95% CI 4.0-4.6).Conclusions. Inequalities in DFLE between ethnic groups are large and exceed those in LE. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have a larger burden of disability that does not seem to be associated with shorter LE. With the increasing population of the non-White British community, it is essential to be able to identify the ethnic groups at higher risk of disability, in order to target appropriate interventions.

1174,"Wolf, A. P. (1995",Sexual attraction and childhood association: A Chinese brief for Edward Westermarck.,"In 1891, the anthropologist Edward Westermarck proposed that early childhood association inhibits sexual attraction and that this aversion was manifested in custom and law as the basis of the universal incest taboo. His argument was accepted as ""the solution of the problem"" by such eminent scholars as Edward Burnett Tylor and Alfred Russel Wallace. Then, in 1910, in the essays later published as ""Totem and Taboo,"" Sigmund Freud challenged the ""Westermarck hypothesis"" on the ground that ""the earliest sexual excitations of youthful human beings are invariably of an incestuous character."" The incest taboo only existed, Freud argued, because of this natural propensity. Freud's challenge carried the day and became the standard view throughout the social and biological sciences. . . . Consequently, the question was: why do all societies repress this natural inclination? In parts of South China people commonly adopted and reared their sons' wives, many women nursing their future daughters-in-law. In addition to comparing these marriages with those in which the bridal pair did not meet until their wedding day, the book uses a wide range of research . . . to demonstrate that Westermarck was right and Freud wrong. It shows that there is a critical period in human development-approximately the 1st 30 mo of life-during which association permanently inhibits sexual attraction. It concludes that the incest taboo is unnecessary and cannot be explained in functional terms, and that encouraging early association between father and daughter is probably the best way of preventing sexual abuse.

Because it has been shown that the sexual attitudes and values of adolescents are influenced by parenting and attachment styles, the ways adolescents perceived their mothers regarding these variables were assessed and related to sexual attitudes and values. Method. A sample of 357 boys and girls were recruited from government and private secondary schools. Participants ranged in age from 12-17 years (M=2.82, SD=0.74). Information regarding parenting styles, the mother-child relationship, family status, social economic status, and dating relationships were collected primarily from the Parenting Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and the Inventory Parent and Peer Assessment (IPPA). The Brief Sexual Attitude Scale (BSAS) was utilized to measure the sexual attitudes and values of participants. Results. Boys who perceived their mother as having permissive parenting style score significantly higher than girls in all the sexual variables, (i.e. sexual permissive, sexual communion and sexual instrumentality).In authoritative, boys score significantly higher than girls in sexual permissiveness and sexual instrumentality but not sexual communion. In authoritarian, boys also score significantly higher than girls in sexual permissiveness and sex communion but not sexual instrumentality. Boys viewed his relationship with mother as trusting scores significantly higher than girls in sexual permissive. Boys also score higher in sexual communion and sexual permissiveness if they viewed their mother child attachment as communicative one. Among alienation style of attachment no gender difference in all sexual variables. In parenting styles specific-wise, authoritarian girls score significantly higher than authoritative girls in sexual instrumentality. In attachment specific-wise, girls who had alienated attachment with mother had significant higher scores in sexual instrumentality than communicative attachment girls. Conclusions. Gender had a moderate effect on sexual attitudes and values. Boys were more open and expressive in sex than girls.

It was expected that the teachers would not stereotype by sex, but would describe both male and female ideals as characterized by the 27 socially valued masculine stereotypic traits and the 11 socially valued feminine stereotypic traits. Using an established measure of sex-role stereotyping, the teachers described ideal adult males and females as being alike on 37 of the 38 traditionally sex-specific bipolar personality traits.

Using the same data, our age 30 estimates are 55% and 87% for women born 1939-1948 and 1969-1978. Our analyses thus document strikingly different levels and trends. METHODS We replicate Finer's single-decrement Kaplan-Meier estimates of premarital sex using Cycles 3-6 of the National Survey of Family Growth, the same data as analyzed by him. We then contrast such single-decrement estimates for both premarital sex and first marriage with estimates of the simple percentages in three states: an origin state in which women begin life as never-married virgins and two destination states for first sex and for first marriage, depending on which occurs first. These analyses provide an empirical illustration of the fact that single-decrement estimates cannot be interpreted as simple percentages for demographic processes involving multiple decrements. RESULTS Our cohort estimates document increases in the percent of US women who had premarital sex by age 25, rising from 53% to 75%, 83%, and 87% for those born 1939-1948, 1949-1958, 1959-1968, and 1969-1978, respectively. CONTRIBUTION Our cohort analyses reveal sharp increases in premarital sex for US women born between 1939 and 1968, with increases most rapid for those born in the 1940s and 1950s.

In addition, the scores of perceived scholastic competence, athletic competence, and global self-worth in Taiwanese children significantly decreased as grade level increased. Multiple Regression Analyses were used to investigate the predictors of children's global self-esteem. It was found that physical appearance explained most of the variation in girls' global self-esteem while behavioral conduct was the most significant factor in predicting boys' global self-worth. The findings also showed that the older the children became, the less variance in global self-worth was accounted for by behavioral conduct. However, the older the children, the more salient physical appearance became in predicting overall self-esteem. The results of paired t-tests for the SPPC and the TRSCAB showed that there was a strong evidence that Taiwanese children rated different domains of their competence much lower than their teachers evaluated them in those same areas of functioning. The results of a 3 (level of authoritarian parenting) x 2 (gender) x 3 (grade level) MANOVA showed that the self-esteem scores among children of mothers with high levels of authoritarian parenting did not differ from those with parents with lower levels of authoritarianism. The positive perceptions of authoritarian parenting in Chinese cultures may contribute to the lack of association between parental authoritarianism and children's low self-esteem.

The counseling primarily provides information about contraception. We evaluated adding premarital HIV/AIDS counseling and voluntary HIV testing to the standard counseling. The test was offered free to one group and at the standard cost to the other. The proportion of those accepting HIV testing among all participants receiving premarital counseling was used as a measure of acceptability. Sixteen percent of participants not charged chose to accept testing versus 1.4% of those charged (p < .001). Lack of HIV/AIDS knowledge and charging for the test were correlated with refusal. Over 5% of participants admitted to premarital sex, most with their fiancÃ©e, and a significantly higher portion was female. Only 22% used condoms. Study participants were randomized for 1-year follow-up. Only four participants reported extramarital sexual activity during that year. Acceptance of HIV testing was disappointingly low. Implementing strategies to reduce stigmatization and increase knowledge of HIV/AIDS, in addition to not charging for testing, may increase the acceptance of HIV testing.",0,1182

Furthermore, the study investigates the impact of dyslexia on the performance in reading and spelling skills and school-related success. Method: A group of 995 6-to 16-year-olds were examined at the initial assessment. Part of the initial sample was then re-examined after 43 and 63 months. The diagnosis of dyslexia was based on the double discrepancy criterion using a standard deviation of 1.5. Though they had no intellectual deficits, the children showed a considerable discrepancy between their reading or writing abilities and (1) their nonverbal intelligence and (2) the mean of their grade norm. Results: Nearly 70 % of those examined had a persisting diagnosis of dyslexia over a period of 63 months. The 5-year course was not influenced by sex. Despite average intelligence, the performance in writing and spelling of children suffering from dyslexia was one standard deviation below a control group without dyslexia with average intelligence and 0.5 standard deviations below a group of children suffering from intellectual deficits. Furthermore, the school-related success of the dyslexics was significantly lower than those of children with average intelligence. Dyslexics showed similar school-related success rates to children suffering from intellectual deficits. Conclusions: Dyslexia represents a considerable developmental risk. The adverse impact of dyslexia on school-related success supports the importance of early diagnostics and intervention. It also underlines the need for reliable and general accepted diagnostic criteria. It is important to define such criteria in light of the prevalence rates. Â© 2017 Hogrefe.",0,1184

Chinese bilingual young adults in the United States (n = 190) completed an online survey assessing acculturation levels and sexual attitudes and behaviors. After controlling for covariates and other acculturation factors, mainstream U.S. acculturation (-), bicultural identity conflict (+), and preference for heritage language (-) were all associated with sexual communication. Mainstream acculturation (+) and preference for heritage language (-) were associated with sexual assertiveness. Approximately half of the sample also provided open-ended descriptions of their use of Chinese and English, clarifying the ways they use different languages to accomplish different relationship goals. Language proficiency was the best predictor of language preference, regardless of the context or the topic of conversation. However, an association between language and cultural values was observed, such that participants tended to be more comfortable with English for sexual communication, stating that Chinese lacks sexual vocabulary. In addition, when expressing negative feelings, Chinese appeared to convey more intense emotion than English for many participants.

METHOD: Non-parametric statistical analysis was conducted with chi square method and ANOVA analysis, due to the risk of small samples in some basic tabulation cells. RESULTS: The main results are as follows: (1) In the support network of workplace associates, moderate drinkers enjoyed much more sociable support care than both nondrinkers and hard drinkers, which might suggest a similar effect as the French paradox. Meanwhile in the familial and kinship network, the more intervening care support was provided, the harder respondents' drinking practice. (2) The drinking network among Japanese people for both sexes is likely to be convergent upon certain types of network categories and not decentralized in various categories. This might reflect of the drinking culture of Japan, which permits people to drink everyday as a practice, especially male drinkers. Subsequently, solitary drinking is not optional for female drinkers. (3) Intervening network analysis showed that the harder the respondents' drinking practices, the more frequently their drinking behaviors were checked in almost all the categories of network. A rather complicated gender double-standard was found in the network of hard drinkers with their friends, particularly for female drinkers. Medical professionals played a similar intervening role for men as family and kinship networks but to a less degree than friends for females. CONCLUSION: The social network is considerably associated with respondents' drinking, providing both sociability for moderate drinkers and intervention for hard drinkers, depending on network categories. To minimize the risk of hard drinking and advance self-healthy drinking there should be more research development on drinking practice and the social network.",0,1189
1190,"Youn, G. (2013",Challenges facing sex therapy in Korea.,"Sexual values and attitudes in Korea are also strongly affected by Confucianism. The union of yin and yang is synonymous with sexual intercourse. This union reflects and maintains the balance and order of nature and so preserves the health and integrity of the family and society. It is not, per se, an act of pleasure, nor is it seen as an expression of intimacy. In Korea, sexual intercourse is a physiological event, a sort of tension release for the male. Female pleasure is not part of the discourse. The belief that women's sexuality, the yin, is weak, leads to the expectation that women do not have independent sexual desires and that their sexuality is only a reaction to a man's desire. In general, Koreans still expect men to take responsibility for initiating and ending sexual activity. Women are expected to be sexually passive. In response to the question, ""How do you resolve sexual urges?"" over 61% of young working women responded that they did not have sexual urges. Many Korean men, especially those 40 years of age and older, follow the traditional gender roles and treat their female partner as an instrument of sexual pleasure with no thought or regard for her needs or desires. Integrity of the family line is of great importance in Korea. In order to ensure that the lineage remains pure, high value is placed not only on female virginity but also on fidelity. However, there exists a double standard in Korea; negative attitudes regarding premarital and extramarital sex are more stringent for women than for men. Homosexuality is considered socially unacceptable and dysfunctional. Sociocultural issues that make practical sex therapy difficult in Korea is discussed in this chapter. Although there is a need for sex therapy in Korea, there are several challenges before it can be widely accepted by the general public. Korean people do not consider it appropriate to discuss sexual problems with anyone, let alone a stranger. Women do not have equal sexual rights and the right to sexual pleasure for women is still unrecognized in Korean culture. Sexual medicine is at present geared primarily toward the resolution of male sexual dysfunction. It is possible that as sexual medicine gains in popularity the need for sex therapy will be recognized. However, sex therapy will only be accepted when the gender imbalance in Korean culture has lessened. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1190
1191,"Young, J. K. (2013",Quite as human as it is negro,"For fifty-one years, everyone read the wrong version of Native Son. Black Boy met a similar fate for thirty-two years, though readers could have stitched together the clues to that textual mystery, if they were especially determined. The only publicly available versions of these works, which continue to define Richard Wright's career, were those he revised at the request of the Book-of- The- Month Club and his influential editor at Harper & Brothers. American Hunger, originally the second half of Wright's autobiography, finally appeared on its own in 1977 (though sections had been serialized in 1944 and 1945, surrounding Black Boy's original publication in the last year of the war), while the original version of Native Son remained invisible until Arnold Rampersad used it as copytext for his 1991 Library of America edition of Wright's Later Works. HarperCollins, the current instantiation of Wright's original publisher, now issues both the ""Abridged"" and ""Restored"" editions of Native Son, along with the ""Restored"" Black Boy, with revisions for the first editions now relegated to notes. While the rhetorical marker of a ""Restored"" edition bestows agency on the editor's recovery of a lost original, the ""Abridged"" designation elides the Book Club's consistent muting of Wright's sexual and political content, as if the manuscripts had simply run long. Those scholars subscribing to an intentionalist editorial theory will surely prefer the ""Restored"" editions. No record survives of Wright's response to changing Native Son, but he clearly resisted cutting the second half of American Hunger and then adjusting its conclusion (and title) accordingly, despite numerous efforts to make those revisions satisfactory to Dorothy Canfield Fisher, the renowned novelist who was also a prominent Book Club judge, and someone considered ""sympathetic to the Negro cause"" by the standards of the day. In any case, Wright's acquiescence to the Book-of- The- Month Club, one of the most powerful agents of literary promotion in the 1940s, represents from an intentionalist perspective a choice between tremendous commercial success and individual authenticity. The need for an intentionalist restoration is especially poignant in the case of these landmark works of African American literature, as Wright's testimony to the material realities of racialized life in Chicago and the South is refracted, as if by iodine, through the white sphere of literary production. On the other hand, the original published editions of Native Son and Black Boy would hold greater historical weight for a materialist editorial approach, precisely for what they reveal about the social circumstances of production. By reading the ""Abridged"" versions of these works, we can see what kinds of images of black male sexuality, for example, could be published and marketed on a mass scale in the early 1940s United States: Wright's compromises and the resulting texts speak more eloquently than their original versions to the dilemma that James Weldon Johnson famously called ""a special problem which the plain American author knows nothing about-the problem of the double audience.""2 John Bryant usefully summarizes the divergent orientations of these editorial theories: ""the two differ in their historicisms, the one seeking a private past, the other a public past. Both isolate crucial components of a culture: The inner workings of creative originating mind(s) to construct a text of the work; the interactions of texts and readers in a social sphere.""3 The compromise Bryant proposes, a theory of textuality as fluid, seeks to bridge this divide by bringing both ""private"" and ""public"" versions of a work together on a page or screen, so that readers may appreciate fluid texts as ""the material evidence of shifting intentions"" (9; original emphasis). Similarly, Peter Shillingsburg finds that while a work (understood as an immaterial collection of material texts) does not reside in any single document or version, ""[e]ach version implies the work in a different way; in juxtaposition, the versions imp y the work in a more complex way."" Like Bryant and Shillingsburg, I would rather read both versions of Native Son and Black Boy in juxtaposition than adjudicate between them for a ""correct"" or ""definitive"" edition. (In practice, I have ordered both editions of the novel from the campus bookstore, so that two halves of a modern fiction course can gradually discover how each Native Son interacts with the other.) Indeed, I would argue that such a ""both/and"" editorial method is especially appropriate for most African American modernist literature, as the ostensibly private sphere of authorial composition and revision has already been rendered troublingly public through Du Bois's double consciousness. Native Son is hardly the first text to be revised before publication in accordance with the marketing pressures of more culturally conservative readers, but the category of race-as produced historically in terms that conjoin ideology and aesthetics-puts particular pressure on conventional notions of the public/private distinction between manuscript and print. Because the public sphere of literary reception is largely defined through what the philosopher Paul Taylor terms ""thick racialism, which holds that the physical differences between races are signs of deeper, typically intellectual and moral, differences,"" the assumed autonomy of the private sphere of composition and revision is compromised by the need to produce a textual self in accordance with (or in opposition to) thick racialist aesthetics. The interesting and productive question is then not which version of Native Son or Black Boy to privilege but rather how to read their manuscript and published editions in mutual relation, for what they reveal about both Wright's authorial choices and the social spheres circumscribing them. In his 1937 essay ""Blueprint for Negro Writing,"" Wright laments that African American texts of this period could function only as either ""a sort of conspicuous ornamentation"" or ""the voice of the educated Negro pleading with white America for justice.""6 At the level of narrative content, both Native Son and Black Boy reject this false dilemma, condemning the entire racist structure of midcentury American society rather than pleading for justice from it. At the same time, the rhetorical effects of both works' revision and marketing reinforce the dichotomy Wright interrogates in ""Blueprint."" Whereas the narrative voice in each text implies an authorial position well beyond the unspoken publishing premise that ""all non Anglo-Saxons are uncomplicated stereotypes,"" as Zora Neale Hurston opined ten years after Native Son, in ""What White Publishers Won't Print,"" the revised implied author of Black Boy and the advertised author of Native Son bracket off cultural complications from their marketing images. 7 In this interaction of versions, between Wright's compositional and publishing decisions, and between each text's linguistic and bibliographic contents, lies the real story of Native Son and Black Boy.

Psychometric support for child temperament and parenting style dimensions was obtained using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. Substantive findings indicated that higher maternal education was linked to more maternal warmth and involvement. Also, child attention focusing was related to a lower use of maternal punishment and to higher scores on maternal confidence and showing respect to the child (a stylistic dimension within the authoritative style). Fathers with more education were found to be more confident in parenting, to be more respectful of their children, and to be more warm and involved in child rearing (stylistic dimensions in the authoritative style). Fathers also used punishment more often with boys versus girls. Although higher child attention focusing was linked to more paternal involvement, more child emotionality was associated with lower paternal respect/confidence, less paternal warmth and involvement, more paternal punishment and verbal directiveness, and more paternal permissiveness. Thus, child gender and temperament appeared to be a more salient factor for Chinese fathers' parenting styles than for mothers' parenting styles.

Improving these conditions remains highly challenging. Purpose: To developed an educational programme to advance the reproductive health of the female workers. Method: An intervention study was conducted between July 2010 and April 2011 in Shenzhen. Two commune factories were selected to participate and provided a control cluster receiving routine local government health services and a second cluster receiving an educational intervention in addition to the routine services. The intervention included distribution and free access to educational study materials. The factory workers' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in the area of reproductive health and STD were the main study outcomes. Results: Compared with the control cluster, at the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention cluster had a significantly higher proportion of correct answers to queries about human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (standardised coefficients of multiple linear regression (B) 0.047; P=0.020) and awareness of places providing free contraceptives (odds ratio [OR] 2.011, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.635-2.472; P<0.001), and a significantly lower proportion accepting premarital sex (OR 0.492, 95 % CI 0.416-0.582; P<0.001), practising premarital sex (OR 0.539, 95 % CI 0.478-0.608; P<0.001) or suffering from gynaecological disorders (OR 0.801, 95 % CI 0.697-0.921; P=0.002).

Correlates of adolescent sexual intercourse onset, whether in early (before age 16) or middle (ages 16-18) adolescence, included living with other than two biological parents, being less monitored by parents, having more advanced physical maturity and more involvement in dating behavior, and having more permissive attitudes toward sex. When studies were organized by age of participants, the onset of intercourse was more strongly associated with alcohol use, delinquency, school problems and (for girls) depressive symptoms in Early studies (sexual intercourse by age 15 or before only) than was found in studies classified as Middle (assessment of sexual intercourse up to age 18) or Late (knowledge of those who delayed until after age 18). Although more research is needed, additional factors were associated with delaying first sexual intercourse until after age 18, including religious attitudes and anxiety, with some factors more relevant for girls and some more applicable to boys. In total, the evidence suggests there are many similarities, but also some important differences, in the correlates associated with early versus middle versus later onset of sexual intercourse. This seems to signify more than one pathway (set of distal and proximal correlates) associated with sexual behavior during adolescence that should be tested in future research. Throughout the review, we highlight differences in the correlates of girls' versus boys' sexual intercourse and how race/ethnicity moderates associations. These gender and racial/ethnic differences were found largely in analyses of family processes, school and religion, and parent education.

This study proposes that the family structures associated with risk-single-mother, step-parent, and cohabiting-influence early sexual debut due to family instability, including shifts in family structure and maternal dating, which can undermine parental control and transmit messages about the acceptability of nonmarital sex. Previous research has not considered maternal dating as a component of family instability, assuming single mothers who date and those who do not date experience comparable levels of family disruption and transmit similar messages about the acceptability of nonmarital sex. Hypotheses are assessed using logistic regression models predicting the odds of early onset of sexual intercourse among 9959 respondents (53 % female, 47 % male) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Respondents were ages 12-17 at the first wave of data collection and 18-26 at the third wave, when respondents reported the age at which they first had sexual intercourse. Results show that maternal dating is a source of family instability with repercussions for early sexual debut. Parental control and permissive attitudes towards teenage sex and pregnancy link at-risk family structures and maternal dating to early sexual initiation among females, though these variables do not fully explain family structure and maternal dating effects. Among males, the influence of maternal dating on early sexual debut is fully explained by the learning of permissive sexual attitudes.

Of particular concern is the way that some Italo-Australian women perceive sexual freedom in Australian society. The paper argues that the moral community represented by the youth network and, in particular, the challenges posed by it to the traditional model of female honour, allow for significant generational changes in the construction of ethnic identity.

The book takes a broad definition of first-wave feminism, including liberal, evangelical and socialist currents. Four cohorts of activists are distinguished. The central chapters of the book comprise an exhaustive analysis of the available historical data on these cohorts, a total of ninety-eight women and eighteen men. The cohort comparisons are also interesting in showing how the central interests and demands of feminists changed over the years. Professor Banks divides these into nine categories, under such headings as 'autonomy', 'sexual double-standard' and 'economic independence'. Becoming a Feminist deserves a place alongside the more conventional histories of the time, because its systematic analysis tells us so much more than narrative alone.

1208,"Canevelli, M., et al. (2014",,"Inappropriate sexual behaviors (ISB) have been increasingly recognized as a component of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementias (BPSD). They can consist of increased libido, masturbation, and/or exposing genitals and/or disrobing in public, excessive kissing, touching, grabbing, and sexual aggressiveness. Their prevalence among demented patients varies widely, being higher in male patients, in the advanced stages of the dementia syndrome, and in skilled nursing facilities. ISB are extremely burdening for families and caregivers as well as extremely challenging for health care providers in institutional care settings. Moreover, they give rise to important ethical considerations in the context of cognitive disorders. Despite their clinical relevance, ISB have been to date scarcely investigated among demented patients. First, there is a current lack of appropriate standardized screening instruments. Moreover, sexual disorders are scarcely explored and not considered as separate items in the most commonly adopted tools evaluating BPSD. This is likely to have hampered the routine clinical assessment of ISB leading to an underestimation of their prevalence. Second, there are currently no available double-blind placebo-controlled trials concerning the pharmacotherapy of such behavioral disorders. Most of the available data come from case series or isolated case reports that, in most of cases, do not describe the medium-long term effectiveness of the adopted treatments. Several commonly used classes of medications have been found to be effective in treating sexual disorders: hormonal agents, betablockers, H2 antagonists, typical and atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors. Also nonpharmacological approaches have shown some efficacy. The aim of our review is to present and discuss available evidence concerning ISB in the context of dementias.

(2011","Review of Premarital sex in America: How young Americans meet, mate, and think about marriage.","Reviews the book, Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think About Marriage by Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker (2011). This book provides a fascinating and highly readable glimpse into the complicated sex lives of heterosexual young adults in the contemporary United States. Sociologists Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker provide one of the most detailed and thought-provoking analyses to date of the ways that single men and women ages 18-23 pursue and negotiate sexual relationships in an era where premarital sex is the norm, Internet pornography is just a click away, and ""friends with benefits"" or occasional sexual relations with an opposite-sex friend is an acceptable alternative to a committed romantic relationship. Yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. The authors find that the gender-based sexual double standard is alive and well on even the most liberal college campuses. The persistence of the double standard is explained by two theories: sexual scripts and sexual economics. In this book, some readers may take offense at the authors' reliance on the theory of sexual economics, which presumes that the rational pursuit of reward maximization-rather than love and a desire for intimacy-govern the sex lives of young people, and especially young men.

1211,"Charles, C. (2013",,"Young women's identities are an issue of public and academic interest across a number of western nations at the present time. This book explores how young women attending an elite school for girls understand and construct 'empowerment'. It investigates the extent to which, and the ways in which, their constructions of empowerment and identity work to overturn, or resist, key regulations and normative expectations for girls in post-feminist, hyper-sexualised cultural contexts. The book provides a succinct overview of feminist theorisations of normative femininities in young women's lives in western cultural contexts. It includes familiar sexist discourses such as sexual double standards, as well as more recent commentary about the regulation of young women's subjectivities in neoliberal, post-feminist, hyper-sexualised cultures. Drawing on ethnographic research in the context of an elite girls' secondary school, the author explores how empowerment for young women is constructed and understood across a range of textual practices. From visual representations of young women in school promotional material, to students' constructions of popular celebrities, the question of how girls' resistance to normative femininities begins to develop is examined. This rich empirical work makes a unique contribution to the study of elite schooling within the sociology of education, drawing on important insights from the field of critical girlhood studies, and posing a challenge to popular feminist notions about media literacy, young women and empowerment. It will be of interest to scholars and postgraduates in the areas of gender studies, sociology, education, youth studies and cultural studies. Â© 2014 Claire Charles. All rights reserved.",0,1211

This is particularly true for white females, for whom the rate is probably about three times that of the 1920's thru the mid-1960's; for white males the rate seems to have risen about 50%. By age 17 or 18, rates for white males and females are about 40%; for black males, probably 95% and black females, about 70%. Premarital intercourse seems to be occurring earlier for both sexes and both races. A sharp decline in double standard attitudes and behaviors is noted. Most adolescents are not promiscuous; sex relations generally occur in an affectionate steady relationship. Only about 15% of sexually active teen-agers appeared to use effective contraceptives consistently (as of 1972). Higher incidence of premarital intercourse, improved physical health, earlier maturation, poor contraceptive practice, and a drop in the early marriage rate probably account, to a large extent, for rising rates of out-of-marriage births to adolescents. Several factors account for the far higher illegitimacy rates among blacks: less use of abortion and effective contraceptives, and fewer forced marriages. (Author)",0,1213

Experimental studies have included predominantly White North American college students; ethnographies, focus group and interview studies, and linguistic analyses have included more diverse samples. Studies show that sexual double standards are influenced by situational and interpersonal factors (e.g., the target's age, level of relationship commitment, and number of partners), and that double standards are local constructions, differing across ethnic and cultural groups. This review discusses methodological issues, including the strengths and limitations of quantitative and qualitative approaches.

We find male sexual jealousy to be the leading substantive issue in social conflict homicides in Detroit. A cross-cultural review of homicide indicates the ubiquity of this motive. Social psychological studies of ""normal"" jealousy and psychiatric studies of ""morbid"" jealousy both suggest that male and female jealousy are qualitatively different in ways consistent with theoretical predictions. Coercive constraint of female sexuality by the use or threat of male violence appears to be cross-culturally universal.

Texts that would otherwise acknowledge the historical specificity of understanding sexuality nonetheless hold tight to what Jagose calls a 'standard narrative of twentieth century orgasm [that] too often emerges as a fundamentally a historical physiological capacity'. Jagose is not arguing here that people do not have, or that there is no such thing as, orgasms. Her focus instead is on how the orgasm in the twentieth century has come to occupy the status of speaking 'the truth of the individual'; this link between orgasm and authenticity is not stable. Her discussion of how sex in general and the orgasm in particular 'becomes increasingly the measure for both individual happiness or satisfaction and the worth of intimate relationships' operates through what she calls the double bind of modern sex: the technologies of self related to the orgasm that are both impersonalising and personalising. She does so by looking at queer public sex culture and heterosexual female anorgasmia. This book reminds readers that feminist and queer traditions themselves can become complacent and forget the amount of work it takes to construct the normal sexual subject and posit heterosexuality as natural and a historical. The ease and deftness with which Jagose moves between the popular and scientific, historical and political, theoretical and experiential conceals the painstaking research and scholarship it must have taken to produce such a revitalising book for queer and feminist readers.

One of her central theses is that 'feminist critiques may unintentionally reinforce rather than abolish sex roles and sex distinctions'. The anthropological material is interesting but the sociological studies she refers to are rather dated, especially fifties Parsonian analyses of family roles. Her book will certainly be of interest to feminists, but they may not be happy with either her development of issues or her lack of adequate theorization. Further, her insistence on the importance only of a discursive, unaccompanied by a materialist transformation of social science, shows only limited ways forward for her project of an ultimate feminist transformation of society too.

It includes social issues, the biology of sex, social standards of right and wrong including the sexual double standard, what peers say, inhibitions learned from one's mother, and the quality of the relationship. The author also includes information helpful for sex therapists, including, but not limited to, many brief case histories of women's sexual problems. Many chapters include topics the reader may not be aware of, such as research on the effects of aging and of hysterectomy on women's sexual desire. There are many citations to articles in psychology journals and well-known sex journals. The author also has an intelligent understanding of research and shows how the results may be dependent, in part, on the research methods, the sample chosen, and so forth. Maass has tried to make the book accessible to many by leaving out jargon, but those without research training may, at times, not be able to appreciate what she is saying. Eisenman notes that other issues discussed include comparisons of sex therapists' views on salient topics such as whether sexual addiction is a valid concept or could be better explained as simple compulsion or some other way and discussions regarding the meaning of sexual fantasy.

This sexual revolution has resulted in both positive and negative aspects, enriching sexual functioning but also providing other risks for criminal, negative and harmful sexual conducts, or Online Sexual Problems (OSP). A deeper understanding of Internet sexuality is therefore important for practitioners who work in the psychological and sexological fields. Current studies on Internet sexuality span a broad spectrum with respect to data collection: interviews, questionnaires, observations, content analyses and Internet log file recordings have all been used. The aim of this paper is to offer the most complete overview of these instruments focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of different tools currently available to assess different dimensions of OSA, and to suggest a simple screener for OSP. A systematic search of published online sexual activities inventories was performed using PsychInfo and Pubmed (1993 to July 2013). Although many of them are adequate for their own purposes, our review revealed a lack of standardized, internationally (culturally) accepted tools that are epidemiologically validated in general populations and that can be used to investigate OSA and to assess OSP. The definitions of OSA and OSP continue to change and basic tools are essential to have a broader idea of the phenomenon and of the challenges and possibilities emerging from the double link between the Internet and sexuality. More accurate instruments are also necessary to help advanced clinical diagnosis and treatment for OSP. Â© 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.",0,1223

To advance academic and applied research, we propose a multidimensional framework for the SDS that can accommodate complex and nuanced meanings, is flexible enough to allow for the dynamic nature of social ideologies, and is grounded in an understanding of social systems of inequality. In this article, we describe three dimensions that define the broad elements of the SDS: (a) polarized (hetero)sexualities, (b) active male and passive female roles, and (c) the power struggle narrative. To illustrate the use of the framework, we contextualize each dimension in terms of the intersection of race and gender for young Black women in the United States. And finally, to apply the framework, we explore the effects the SDS can have on sexual health and suggest some directions for public health interventions. These analyses lay the groundwork for more complex and comprehensive investigations of the SDS and its effects on sexual health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1224

An attack on a woman is a more serious transgression than an attack on a man because it violates a special norm protecting women from harm. This norm--""chivalry""--discourages would-be attackers and encourages third parties to protect women. However, violence toward women often occurs in marriage and other intimate relations, where the impact of third parties is often limited. The privacy of intimate relations, not tolerance of violence against women, leaves some women vulnerable to male violence. I begin the chapter with a description of the chivalry norm and speculation about its possible origins. I then review evidence concerning whether participants in experiments and criminal justice officials are reluctant to harm women, and whether that reluctance is related to traditional attitudes about gender roles and the presence of an audience and mirrors. After discussing the double standard as an exception to the chivalry effect, I examine research on reactions to violence against women. I discuss the treatment of violence against wives historically and in other cultures and the implications of privacy concerns for that treatment.

Results: For the comparison of flibanserin with placebo, primary efficacy endpoints: satisfying sexual events (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.37-0.80, P < 0.00001); sexual desire score (the SMD = 1.91, 95% CI = 0.21 to 3.60, P = 0.03) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) desire domain score (the SMD = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.19-0.46, P < 0.00001) and key secondary efficacy endpoints: FSFI total score, Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) total score, FSDS-R Item 13 score, Patient's Global Impression of Improvement score and Patient Benefit Evaluation indicated that flibanserin was more effective than the placebo. Safety assessments included the proportion of women who experienced an adverse event (odds ratio = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.34 to 1.76, P < 0.00001), nervous system disorders and fatigue indicated that flibanserin was well tolerated. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that flibanserin to be an effective and safe treatment for HSDD in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1230

Love has been defined in this paper as canalization, when the love satisfier provides sufficient pleasure over sufficient time. Once canalization or real love has occurred it is permanent, becoming a part of the drive system of the individual. Thus, when a satisfier, one's mate, has been canalized upon, there is an excellent chance for permanence and happiness. However, our society provides many barriers to canalization on a member of the opposite sex. The superficiality and mutual exploitiveness of our courtship and dating patterns and the double sex standard make it difficult to develop a deep enough relationship (from which sufficient pleasure over sufficient time can be achieved) so that canalization can occur. Ways of achieving healthy canalization in our society are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1231

The various links between love and sex are broadly surveyed, including the views of undergraduates, philosophers, psychologists, evolutionary biologists, and close relationships scholars, among others. Aron and Aron (1991) devised a dimensional approach for relating love and sex, with sex dominant at one end of the dimension, love at the other end, and both equally important at the midpoint. This approach is used in a general way to organize the chapter. The ""love is really sex"" endpoint of the dimension captures a broad range of naturalistic/biological perspectives. We discuss the evolution of sex, speculate on an appropriate ""unit of selection,"" and consider the evolution of love, particularly passionate love, along with mating strategies. We also analyze the relation of adult attachment to love and sex. The ""sex is really love"" end of the dimension as well as the middle area includes a wide array of psychological and sociological approaches. We survey such topics as passionate versus companionate love, the double standard, and orientations toward sexuality. Several recent studies (e.g., Sprecher & Regan, 1998) have found interesting associations between sexual desire and passionate love. We also describe our own work on love and sexual attitudes, taking the position that people hold belief systems about love and sex and how (not whether) the two are related. Gender differences and similarities are attended to as well in this research description. We conclude that the intersection of sex and love perhaps captures the real essence of humanity: The union of our biological nature with our personhood as enacted through the gift of love.

(2010",Premarital couple predictors of marital relationship quality and stability: A meta-analytic study.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the most important premarital couple protective and risk factors associated with marital relationship quality and stability by utilizing meta-analytic procedures to calculate standardized effect sizes for each factor. Extant research was identified and evaluated using the following inclusionary criteria: the dependent variables had to measure some form of marital quality or stability, the independent variables had to be premarital in nature, the participants had to have married after 1969, and the statistics necessary for the computation of a zero-order correlation effect size had to be available. Meta-analytic procedures were then utilized to code studies meeting inclusionary criteria, aggregate conceptually-comparable variables across included studies, and calculate standardized zero-order correlational effect sizes for each aggregated premarital factor. The predictive magnitude of premarital couple factors associated with subsequent marital outcomes was generally moderate. The results indicated both medium and small effect sizes for the various identified premarital couple predictors of marital relationship quality and instability. Positive premarital factors were generally associated with positive marital outcomes and negative premarital factors were generally associated with negative outcomes. The strongest significant protective and risk factors for marital distress and dissolution were as follows. The protective factors against marital distress included premarital relationship quality (e.g., love, satisfaction, support), premarital relationship stability (e.g., commitment, stability), attitude and value similarity (e.g., autonomy, lifestyle, expectations), positive premarital interactions (e.g., assertiveness, empathy, self-disclosure), religiosity similarity (e.g., religion importance, beliefs, denominational affiliation), and family-of-origin experience similarity factors (e.g., attachment, parent-child relationship, parents' marriage, physical violence). The protective factors against marital dissolution included premarital relationship stability, religiosity similarity, premarital relationship quality, and positive interactions. The risk factors for marital distress included negative premarital interactions (e.g., conflict, criticism, demand-withdraw) and premarital violence (e.g., physical aggression, sexual coercion, violence). The risk factors for marital dissolution included negative interactions and premarital cohabitation with one's spouse. No significant gender differences were identified for any of the premarital predictive factors.

The concept hooking up, the slang term for a range of behaviors and arrangements that constitute causal sexual encounters, is the central focus of Kathleen Bogle's book. The author uses these narratives to paint a picture of what students perceive as a hooking-up encounter and as a lens to discuss how and why they are participating in this behavior. In doing so, she includes candid discussions about campus life, norms, and gender, such as whether the sexual double standard still exists. Some of her interviewees are college graduates and reflect on their experiences and how those have influenced their post collegiate life. This book is recommended for those in an academic setting, for those about to enter college as students or parents, and for health care providers looking to understand the dominant culture today. If the hookup era has truly arrived and replaced dating as suggested in this book, it is imperative that researchers and clinicians begin identifying a more holistic picture of this behavior on and off college campuses, as well as among sexual minority individuals. Given that young adults are first developing their ideas of healthy relationships during this period of time, understanding these encounters and their psychological impact has significant mental and physical health implications.

Facing the Complexities of Women's Sexual Desire, by veteran sex therapist Vera Sonja Maass, is one of the few books to address these intimate phenomena in practical clinical detail. Background chapters outline the often-conflicting factors influencing women's sexuality and sexual response, both biological (e.g., hormones, pregnancy) and sociocultural (e.g., media images, double standards). ""The Woman in Context"" section explores individual characteristics and symptoms as manifested in relationships, particularly as terms of interpersonal styles and power dynamics.

Current theories and therapies relevant to problems of desire are covered in depth. An effective cognitive-behavioral model is applied in solo, couples, group, and single-sided relationship therapy settings. Its specialized focus makes Facing the Complexities of Women's Sexual Desire an important addition to the bookshelf of sex and marriage therapists, clinical and women's health psychologists, and students planning to enter these areas.

This research showed that adolescents use pornography, but prevalence rates varied greatly. Adolescents who used pornography more frequently were male, at a more advanced pubertal stage, sensation seekers, and had weak or troubled family relations. Pornography use was associated with more permissive sexual attitudes and tended to be linked with stronger gender-stereotypical sexual beliefs. It also seemed to be related to the occurrence of sexual intercourse, greater experience with casual sex behavior, and more sexual aggression, both in terms of perpetration and victimization.

Presented here are psychoanalytic, neo-analytic, evolutionary psychology, cognitive social learning, social structural, and gender schema theories. The gender similarities hypothesis (Hyde, 2006) suggests that gender differences for the majority of psychological factors are minimal. Our review supports this hypothesis with findings from meta-analyses of sexual attitudes and behaviors and suggests that gender similarities in sexuality are the rule rather than the exception. Although there are gender differences in some areas of sexuality, such as masturbation incidence and pornography use, the majority of sexual attitudes and behaviors are associated with minimal gender differences. Even when these differences do exist, socio-cultural explanations, such as differences in self-report and inequality of power, are potential explanations. Emphasizing gender similarities in sexuality where they exist is essential for breaking down the double standard and gaining equality of sexual expression. As society becomes more sexually liberal and gender differences continue to narrow, equal opportunities for sexual expression become more realistic. Implications of gender equality in sexuality include reduced power differentials, which in turn should increase sexual self-esteem, produce fewer sexual disorders associated with performance anxiety, and reduce sexual violence.

Evolutionary psychology, cognitive social learning theory, social structural theory, and the gender similarities hypothesis provided predictions about gender differences in sexuality. We analyzed gender differences in 30 reported sexual behaviors and attitudes for 834 individual samples uncovered in literature searches and 7 large national data sets. In support of evolutionary psychology, results from both the individual studies and the large data sets indicated that men reported slightly more sexual experience and more permissive attitudes than women for most of the variables. However, as predicted by the gender similarities hypothesis, most gender differences in sexual attitudes and behaviors were small. Exceptions were masturbation incidence, pornography use, casual sex, and attitudes toward casual sex, which all yielded medium effect sizes in which male participants reported more sexual behavior or permissive attitudes than female participants. Most effect sizes reported in the current study were comparable to those reported in Oliver and Hyde's study. In support of cognitive social learning theory, year of publication moderated the magnitude of effect sizes, with gender differences for some aspects of sexuality increasing over time and others decreasing. As predicted by social structural theory, nations and ethnic groups with greater gender equity had smaller gender differences for some reported sexual behaviors than nations and ethnic groups with less gender equity.

Fernet (2016",A metasynthesis of qualitative studies on casual sexual relationships and experiences.,"Most Studies on casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) are quantitative and focus on characteristics of individuals who experience them. There has been an increase in qualitative research on CSREs that have revealed new insights into how they are experienced among young adults. To synthesize qualitative knowledge on how CSREs are experienced, a qualitative metasynthesis was carried out using 13 studies published up to June, 2015, yielding seven conceptual categories. Opportunities and choices regarding CSREs were organized according to biographical context, socioenvironmental context, and peer norms. Expectations of CSREs related to lack of communication, emotional, and sexual commitment or accountability. Implicit rules allowed maintaining boundaries between sex and emotion. Thus, CSREs can satisfy various needs related to sex and intimacy. Sex in CSREs was reported as pleasure-centred, accessible, and improved when experienced in association with intimacy. However, intimacy and gender roles interfered with condom use. The sexual double standard and gender roles limited women's agency and enjoyment of sex. Expectations for the lack of intimacy and communication conflicted with developing unrequited feelings, resulting in self-blame and attempts to suppress emotions. While partners may have a hard time defining their relationship over time, some CSREs involved developing friendships or romance, and ruining friendships. The results indicate a clash between expectations, rules, and experiences of CSREs. The lack of symbolic markers for the meaning or status of CSREs as they develop can be seen as a consequence of the complexity of these relationships.

1261,"Roy, M. and H. Payette (2012",The body image construct among Western seniors: A systematic review of the literature.,"Despite numerous body image researches focusing on children, adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, there is a dearth regarding the body image of Western seniors. In this paper, we reviewed this literature using a systematic three-step extraction procedure plus a quality evaluation assessment for each retained article. The results showed that, while body dissatisfaction (BD) and body image distortion (BID) exist at older ages, the importance given to body image as it relates to physical appearance is lower in comparison with younger samples. Associations between body image and physical/mental health were also shown. Various tensions regarding the aging body (appearance vs. health, inside vs. outside, natural vs. unnatural) as well as a double standard of aging were also reported among older women. We conclude that the body image experience of Western seniors has both specificities and similarities with the one of younger populations. We also conclude that some methodological aspects of the literature on body image among older adults need to be addressed in order to move forward with this field of research.

1262,"Sagebin Bordini, G. and T. M. Sperb (2013",Sexual double standard: A review of the literature between 2001 and 2010.,"The present article is a review of 26 studies on the sexual double standard. This phenomenon consists of different rules and standards of sexual behavior for men and women. Only scientific articles reporting empirical research published between 2001 and 2010 and available online in full were included. Our review was focused on the evidence of the existence of the sexual double standard and on the methods that have been used in the studies in this field. Most studies used quantitative methods based on scales or vignette tasks with a target to be evaluated by respondents. There was greater variability of results among the 6 studies using qualitative methods. These studies employed different interview techniques, focus groups and participant observation. There were also 2 studies reporting the use of mixed methods. The results of the studies showed that the sexual double standard still can be identified nowadays, although it seems that sexual behaviors and situations influenced by this phenomenon are changing. Today, premarital sex and sexual intercourse outside of committed relationships are more accepted for both genders. However, evaluations of other facets of sexuality continue to be based on different criteria for men and women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1262

1264,"Temple-Smith, M., et al. (2015",,"Sexuality in Adolescence: The Digital Generation provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of research and theory about adolescent sexuality in todayâs world. The book examines biological, social and health-related approaches and reviews qualitative and quantitative research from psychology, sociology, epidemiology and medicine, emphasising the interplay between perspectives and privileging the voices of young people as they discuss the joys and pains of sexual awakening. The focus is on understanding healthy sexual development and its many variations, but problems and issues arising as young people make their journey to adult sexuality are also considered. The book presents global research on many key issues of our time, including the impact of media and technology on adolescent sexuality, changes in adolescent sexual behaviors and beliefs, sexual risk taking, sex education, and teen pregnancy and abortion. This fully revised and updated third edition of Sexuality in Adolescence also addresses the crucial issues of sexual diversity, sexual safety and sexual communication, including coercion, peer pressure and double standards. In Sexuality in Adolescence: The Digital Generation, the authors aim to promote sexual wellbeing, and argue for the importance of the adolescent period as a time for engendering healthy sexual attitudes and practices. This book will be valuable reading for students in the social, behavioural and health sciences who are interested in adolescent development and the topic of sexuality, as well as for professionals working with young people and families.

1265,"Theodoridis, C. (1920",Sexual experience and behaviour in the perspective of social psychology.,"The importance of sexual experience in the development of ideas of morality and social customs is coming to be more fully recognized. In fact, the libido is the only valid point of reference for those mores common to nearly all tribes and peoples. The psychology of the matter is to be sought for in certain psychic dispositions which the sexual act has left in man. A feeling of power and superiority and a desire for possession and permanent ownership is accompanied in man by the conviction that the woman has been defiled and made impure. These factors have been fundamental in determining the course of social evolution: the former has brought about patriarchism in its various manifestations, and the latter has been responsible for the restrictions, under the guise of protection against defilement, imposed upon women and the widespread prevalence of double standards of morality. Today among cultured people greater freedom is granted to woman, and in some cases, formal equality with man before the law. Masculine chivalry, proceeding from a feeling of sympathy for woman in the lowly state in which man himself has kept her, tries to make amends. But in actual practice her position is not greatly improved. Patriarchism persists as the most sacred of social traditions against which no insidious sentimentality must be allowed to prevail.

1266,"Thompson, A. P. (1983",Extramarital sex: A review of the research literature.,"Discusses definitional problems that reveal the need for increased rigor in specifying the sexual behavior under consideration, the dyad or group outside of which the behavior occurs, and the consensual or nonconsensual nature of the behavior. 12 surveys of extramarital sex (EMS) are examined and the limitations of incidence rate figures discussed. Empirical studies have attempted to identify key variables that discriminate between EMS and non-EMS samples. Findings of this research are summarized according to 4 variable categories: social background characteristics, characteristics of the marriage, personal readiness characteristics, and sex and gender differences. Characteristics of the marriage and personal readiness characteristics are found to be of prime importance in understanding EMS, although sex and gender differences frequently qualify major empirical relationships. The attitude continuum of extramarital sexual permissiveness (EMSP) has received considerable research attention. Although premarital sexual permissiveness is the most significant correlate of EMSP, tenuous results of research examining the attitude-behavior (EMSP/EMS) link demonstrate the need for new conceptualizations in this area.

1267,"Turnquist, B. E. (1991",,"This document reviews research concerning the factors affecting premarital sexual attitudes and behaviors of adolescents and young adults. Trends in the literature prior to 1980 are discussed briefly together with summaries of literature reviews from the decades of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Studies from 1980 to the present are reviewed in some detail, emphasizing the following determinants of premarital sex in adolescents and young people: parental influence; peer influence; personality and self-perception; religiosity; affective components; educational and cultural factors; and gender differences. It is concluded that: (1) there has been an overall increase in the permissiveness in premarital sexual behavior, as well as a steady decline in the age of first intercourse; (2) there is a strong suspicion that the rise in sexual permissiveness among adolescents and young adults may be due increasingly to a split between personal attitudes or beliefs and actual behavior; and (3) gender alone is no longer a distinguishing factor in premarital sexual behavior, although women appear to endorse more traditional attitudes than men. It is concluded that these results point to the importance of sex education both at the behavioral and attitudinal levels. Finally, it is recommended that there is a need for children to be given explicit training concerning development of healthy attitudes toward sexual behavior. (BHK)",0,1267
1268,"Vazquez-Garcia, V. (2007",Review of Virginity lost: An intimate portrait of first sexual experiences.,"Reviews the book, Virginity lost: An intimate portrait of first sexual experiences by Laura M. Carpenter (2005). Carpenter draws on qualitative methodologies to explore what she calls 'the metaphors' of virginity loss. Although her approach does not allow her to make claims about the prevalence of beliefs and behaviors among the general population, the diversity of her sample (33 women, of whom 22 self-identified as heterosexual, seven as lesbians and four as bisexual; and 28 men, of whom 17 described themselves as heterosexual, nine as gay and two as bisexual) helps her analyze the different ways in which social identities (gender, sexual, ethnic, racial) are constructed through virginity loss, thereby showing its relevance for a healthy sex life during adulthood. The author identifies three metaphors of virginity loss: virginity as a gift to be given to a special partner; virginity as a stigma to get rid of; and virginity as a step in the process of becoming an adult. Half of the people she interviewed considered virginity as a gift, more than one-third thought of it as a stigma and just over half viewed it as a step in a process. Carpenter also interviewed two people who interpreted virginity as an act of religious worship where premarital virginity is expected. Not surprisingly, these metaphors are gendered: heterosexual women tended to favor the gift metaphor and to advocate premarital virginity as an ideal; heterosexual men geared towards the stigma metaphor. These patterns reflect the double standard where women are expected to be sexually passive and men active and experienced. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1268

Rudman and Janell C. Fetterolf (see record 2014-29579-016). Rudman and Fetterolf relied on quasi-paraphrase to attribute tenets to the author's theory. The authors encourage readers to read their own presentation of the author's theory and then read Rudman and Fetterolf's interpretation to see for themselves. Rudman and Fetterolf wrote that sexual economics theory (SET) is a dark view of gender relations that portrays women as low-status commodity holders and men as highstatus commodity seekers. The very notion of exchange entails that both sides have commodities, which they trade. Rudman and Fetterolf's failure to find a gender difference in Implicit Association Test (IAT) responses to sexual stimuli does not surprise authors, nor does it indicate anything about gender differences in the desire for sex. Rudman and Fetterolf's few findings that were statistically significant either were misinterpreted or supported SET. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1269
1270,"Welles, C. E. (2005",Breaking the Silence Surrounding Female Adolescent Sexual Desire.,"This review of the literature related to female adolescent sexual desire reveals that, in spite of interest by feminist scholars, actual discourse around sexual desire and bodily pleasure associated with female sexuality appears to be lacking for the majority of adolescent girls. In our culture females are the objects of male desire, hence the focus on attractiveness. Little attention has been paid to their embodiment, the inner sense of their own sexual desire. Sexual desire has traditionally been accepted as part of male sexual development and is associated with positive sexual identity for men. Researchers stress the importance of increasing sex-positive attitudes towards female sexual desire, in order to counter much of the shame and confusion experienced by females, especially during adolescence. The double standard is still being conveyed to young women through popular culture, parents, peers, and schools. Sex education primarily emphasizes the dangers of sex. The media stresses the importance of attractiveness and women as sex objects rather than agents of their own sexual desires. Researchers suggest that a young woman's ability to be conscientious about and fully present in her sexual experiences is correlated with her ability to act as an agent. The ability to make responsible and self-affirming sexual decisions is a crucial act of agency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1270
1271,"Zaikman, Y. and M. J. Marks (2017",Promoting theory-based perspectives in sexual double standard research.,"The sexual double standard (SDS) has been a focus of research for several decades. Numerous anecdotal accounts of the double standard exist, detailing its consequences and impact on women's, as well as men's, sexual behavior and identities. Empirical research, however, has yet to completely corroborate the degree to which the double standard pervades everyday life. The disparity between anecdotal accounts and empirical evidence related to the SDS may be the result of the partially atheoretical approach with which the SDS has traditionally been examined. The goal of the present paper is to encourage researchers to take a more theory-oriented approach to understanding the double standard. Our goal is not to provide another comprehensive literature review or an argument for the ""best"" theory, but rather to promote theory-based perspectives in future SDS research. In the current paper, three theoretical perspectives-evolutionary theory, social role theory, and cognitive social learning theory-and their relevance to the SDS are discussed. We discuss four hypotheses, one related to the core tenet of the SDS itself, and three related to moderating factors, including characteristics of evaluators (i.e., gender, gender roles beliefs, and sexual history), characteristics of targets (i.e., relationship type engaged in, sexual activities participated in, and power status), and social factors (i.e., cultural background, historical era, and socialization agents). Existing research is also interpreted in light of one or more of the theoretical perspectives in the hopes of guiding future research.
