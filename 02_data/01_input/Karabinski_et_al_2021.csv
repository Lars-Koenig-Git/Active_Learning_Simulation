Journal of Advanced Nursing 71(2","Aims: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between bullying and burnout and the potential buffering effect psychological detachment might have on this relationship. Background: There is evidence to suggest that bullying is relatively widespread in the nursing profession, with previous studies indicating that bullying is associated with higher levels of burnout. There is, however, limited research focusing on potential moderators of the relationship between bullying and burnout. Design: A cross‐sectional quantitative study conducted with self‐completed, anonymous questionnaires. Methods: The study was conducted in 2011 with 762 Registered Nurses in Australia. Two hypotheses were tested with validated measures of bullying, psychological detachment and burnout. The hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression. Results: Bullying is positively associated with burnout. Psychological detachment does not significantly moderate the relationship between bullying and burnout. Conclusion: The results indicate that bullying exacts a strong negative toll on nurses. Ensuring there are workplace policies and practices in place in healthcare organizations to reduce the instances of bullying and proactively address it when it does occur would therefore seem crucial. Individuals may also lower their risk of burning out by psychologically detaching from work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",1,1

Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids 32(50","Determining the force required to detach a droplet from a fiber or from an assembly of fibers is of great importance to many applications. A novel technique is developed in this work to measure this force experimentally by using ferrofluid droplets in a magnetic field. Unlike previous methods reported in the literature, our technique does not require air flow or a mechanical object to detach the droplet from the fiber(s); therefore, it simplifies the experiment and also allows one to study the capillarity of the droplet-fiber system in a more isolated environment. In this article, we investigated the effects of the relative angle between intersecting fibers on the force required to detach a droplet from the fibers in the in-plane or out-of-plane direction. The in-plane and through-plane detachment forces were also predicted via numerical simulation and compared with the experimental results. Good agreement was observed between the numerical and experimental results. It was found that the relative angle between intersecting fibers has no significant effect on the detachment force in the out-of-plane direction. However, the detachment force in the in-plane direction depends strongly on the relative angle between the fibers, and it increases as this angle increases.",1,2

Soft matter 12(36","Microparticle adsorption and self-assembly at fluid interfaces are strongly affected by the particle three-phase contact angle θ. On the single-particle level, θ can be determined by several techniques, including colloidal-probe AFM, the gel-trapping technique (GTT) and the freeze-fracture shadow-casting (FreSCa) method. While GTT and FreSCa provide contact angle distributions measured over many particles, colloidal-probe AFM measures the wettability of an individual (specified) particle attached onto an AFM cantilever. In this paper, we extract θ for smooth microparticles through the analysis of force-distance curves upon particle approach and retraction from the fluid interface. From each retraction curve, we determine: (i) the maximal force, Fmax; (ii) the detachment distance, Dmax; and (iii) the work for quasistatic detachment, W. To relate Fmax, Dmax and W to θ, we developed a detailed theoretical model based on the capillary theory of flotation. The model was validated in three different ways. First, the contact angles, evaluated from Fmax, Dmax and W, are all close in value and were used to calculate the entire force-distance curves upon particle retraction without any adjustable parameters. Second, the model was successfully applied to predict the experimental force-distance curve of a truncated sphere, whose cut is positioned below the point of particle detachment from the interface. Third, our theory was confirmed by the excellent agreement between the particle contact angles obtained from the colloidal-probe AFM data and the ensemble-average contact angles measured by both GTT and FreSCa. Additionally, we devised a very accurate closed-form expression for W (representing the energy barrier for particle detachment), thus extending previous results in the literature.",1,3

On the basis of the work–home resources model, we propose that weekly rumination undermines effective use of personal resources (i.e., self-efficacy), whereas weekly psychological detachment from the major life events facilitates effective use. In addition, we hypothesize that work role centrality acts as a key resource, and amplifies the two-way interaction effects. Results of multilevel analyses were generally in line with predictions, and support the work–home resources model.

Journal of Organizational Behavior 39(3","This meta‐analytic study examines the antecedents and outcomes of four recovery experiences: psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control. Using 299 effect sizes from 54 independent samples (N = 26,592), we extend theory by integrating recovery experiences into the challenge–hindrance framework, creating a more comprehensive understanding of how both after‐work recovery and work characteristics collectively relate to well‐being. The results of meta‐analytic path estimates indicate that challenge demands have stronger negative relationships with psychological detachment, relaxation, and control recovery experiences than hindrance demands, and job resources have positive relationships with relaxation, mastery, and control recovery experiences. Psychological detachment after work has a stronger negative relationship with fatigue than relaxation or control experiences, whereas control experiences after work have a stronger positive relationship with vigor than detachment or relaxation experiences. Additionally, a temporally driven model with recovery experiences as a partial mediator explains up to 62% more variance in outcomes (ΔR² = .12) beyond work characteristics models, implying that both work characteristics and after‐work recovery play an important role in determining employee well‐being.

Personnel Review 46(5","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine a moderated mediation model that investigated the moderating role of psychological detachment in the relationship between work intensity and life satisfaction via emotional exhaustion. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 149 hospital-based nurses who completed a questionnaire about working conditions and individual outcomes. The data were analyzed using hierarchical moderated regression and bootstrapping techniques. Findings: The results confirm that work intensity is negatively related to life satisfaction via emotional exhaustion. The results also demonstrate that psychological detachment diminishes the negative influence of emotional exhaustion on life satisfaction. The conditional indirect effect model shows that the indirect relationship between work intensity and life satisfaction is strongest at low psychological detachment. Research limitations/implications: This research advances our understanding of the negative work and non-work implications associated with work intensity. The key limitation of this research was the cross-sectional data set. HRM researchers should seek to replicate and expand the results with multi-wave data to extend our understanding of the implications of work intensity. Practical implications: HRM practitioners need to begin implementing measures to address work intensity in order to thwart its negative effects. HRM practitioners need to implement policies and procedures that limit the intensity of work demands to promote positive employee work and non-work outcomes. Originality/value: This is the first study to show that work intensity can influence life satisfaction through emotional exhaustion. Contrary to most recovery research, this research is also among the first to focus on the moderating role of psychological detachment, especially within a conditional indirect effect model.

Academy of Management Journal 56(6","This three-week longitudinal field study with an experimental intervention examines the association between daily events and employee stress and health, with a specific focus on positive events. Results suggest that both naturally occurring positive work events and a positive reflection intervention are associated with reduced stress and improved health, though effects vary across momentary, lagged, daily, and day-to-evening spillover analyses. Findings are consistent with theory-based predictions: positive events, negative events, and family-to-work conflict independently contribute to perceived stress, blood pressure, physical symptoms, mental health, and work detachment, suggesting that organizations should focus not only on reducing negative events, but also on increasing positive events. These findings show that a brief, end-of-workday positive reflection led to decreased stress and improved health in the evening. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,8

Findings from 499 managers in the restaurant industry show that psychological detachment (measured as intention to leave) is significantly related to voice and mediates relationships between perceptions of leadership (leader-member exchange and abusive supervision) and voice, whereas psychological attachment (measured as affective commitment) is neither a direct predictor of voice nor a mediator of leadership-voice relationships.

Journal of environmental management 202: 268-275.","Rainfall-induced soil erosion is a major threat, especially in agricultural soils. In the Mediterranean belt, vineyards are affected by high soil loss rates, leading to land degradation. Plantation of new vines is carried out after deep ploughing, use of heavy machinery, wheel traffic, and trampling. Those works result in soil physical properties changes and contribute to enhanced runoff rates and increased soil erosion rates. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the plantation of vineyards on soil hydrological and erosional response under low frequency - high magnitude rainfall events, the ones that under the Mediterranean climatic conditions trigger extreme soil erosion rates. We determined time to ponding, Tp; time to runoff, Tr; time to runoff outlet, Tro; runoff rate, and soil loss under simulated rainfall (55 mm h-1, 1 h) at plot scale (0.25 m2) to characterize the runoff initiation and sediment detachment. In recent vine plantations (<1 year since plantation; R) compared to old ones (>50 years; O). Slope gradient, rock fragment cover, soil surface roughness, bulk density, soil organic matter content, soil water content and plant cover were determined. Plantation of new vineyards largely impacted runoff rates and soil erosion risk at plot scale in the short term. Tp, Tr and Tro were much shorter in R plots. Tr-Tp and Tro-Tr periods were used as connectivity indexes of water flow, and decreased to 77.5 and 33.2% in R plots compared to O plots. Runoff coefficients increased significantly from O (42.94%) to R plots (71.92%) and soil losses were approximately one order of magnitude lower (1.8 and 12.6 Mg ha-1 h-1 for O and R plots respectively). Soil surface roughness and bulk density are two key factors that determine the increase in connectivity of flows and sediments in recently planted vineyards. Our results confirm that plantation of new vineyards strongly contributes to runoff initiation and sediment detachment, and those findings confirms that soil erosion control strategies should be applied immediately after or during the plantation of vines.",1,10

A cross-sectional sample of 439 coal miners completed a self-report questionnaire that assessed their job demands, psychological detachment, job anxiety, and CWBs in a Chinese context. The conceptual model, based on the stressor-detachment model, was examined using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that psychological detachment mediates not only the relation between job demands and job anxiety but also that between job demands and CWBs. Furthermore, the relation between job demands and CWBs is sequentially mediated by psychological detachment and job anxiety. Our findings validate the effectiveness of the stressor-detachment model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the underlying mechanism of the relation between job demands and CWBs can be explained by psychological detachment and job anxiety.

Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids 31(40","In this work we experimentally and theoretically analyze the detachment of microscopic polystyrene beads from different self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces in a shear flow in order to develop a mechanistic model for the removal of cells from surfaces. The detachment of the beads from the surface is treated as a thermally activated process applying an Arrhenius Ansatz to determine the activation barrier and attempt frequency of the rate determing step in bead removal. The statistical analysis of the experimental shear detachment data obtained in phosphate-buffered saline buffer results in an activation energy around 20 kJ/mol, which is orders of magnitude lower than the adhesion energy measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The same order of magnitude for the adhesion energy measured by AFM is derived from ab initio calculations of the van der Waals interaction energy between the polystyrene beads and the SAM-covered gold surface. We conclude that the rate determing step for detachment of the beads is the initiation of rolling on the surface (overcoming static friction) and not physical detachment, i.e., lifting the particle off the surface.",1,12

Journal of Occupational Health Psychology 22(1","It has been argued that when people believe that their work is a calling, it can often be experienced as an intense and consuming passion with significant personal meaning. While callings have been demonstrated to have several positive outcomes for individuals, less is known about the potential downsides for those who experience work in this way. This study develops a multiple-meditation model proposing that, while the intensity of a calling has a positive direct effect on work-related vigor, it motivates people to work longer hours, which both directly and indirectly via longer work hours, limits their psychological detachment from work in the evenings. In turn, this process reduces sleep quality and morning vigor. Survey and diary data of 193 church ministers supported all hypotheses associated with this model. This implies that intense callings may limit the process of recovery from work experiences. The findings contribute to a more balanced theoretical understanding of callings.

PloS one 9(12","OBJECTIVETo investigate the effectiveness of a worksite social and physical environment intervention on need for recovery (i.e., early symptoms of work-related mental and physical fatigue), physical activity and relaxation. Also, the effectiveness of the separate interventions was investigated.METHODSIn this 2 × 2 factorial design study, 412 office employees from a financial service provider participated. Participants were allocated to the combined social and physical intervention, to the social intervention only, to the physical intervention only or to the control group. The primary outcome measure was need for recovery. Secondary outcomes were work-related stress (i.e., exhaustion, detachment and relaxation), small breaks, physical activity (i.e., stair climbing, active commuting, sport activities, light/moderate/vigorous physical activity) and sedentary behavior. Outcomes were measured by questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Multilevel analyses were performed to investigate the effects of the three interventions.RESULTSIn all intervention groups, a non-significant reduction was found in need for recovery. In the combined intervention (n = 92), exhaustion and vigorous physical activities decreased significantly, and small breaks at work and active commuting increased significantly compared to the control group. The social intervention (n = 118) showed a significant reduction in exhaustion, sedentary behavior at work and a significant increase in small breaks at work and leisure activities. In the physical intervention (n = 96), stair climbing at work and active commuting significantly increased, and sedentary behavior at work decreased significantly compared to the control group.CONCLUSIONNone of the interventions was effective in improving the need for recovery. It is recommended to implement the social and physical intervention among a population with higher baseline values of need for recovery. Furthermore, the intervention itself could be improved by increasing the intensity of the intervention (for example weekly GMI-sessions), providing physical activity opportunities and exercise schemes, and by more drastic environment interventions (restructuring entire department floor).TRIAL REGISTRATIONNederlands Trial Register NTR2553.",1,14

Physical activity and relaxation are helpful in decreasing the need for recovery. This article aims to describe (1) the development and (2) the design of the evaluation of a daily physical activity and relaxation intervention to reduce the need for recovery in office employees.METHODS/DESIGNThe study population will consist of employees of a Dutch financial service provider. The intervention was systematically developed, based on parts of the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol. Assessment of employees needs was done by combining results of face-to-face interviews, a questionnaire and focus group interviews. A set of theoretical methods and practical strategies were selected which resulted in an intervention program consisting of Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI) supported by a social media platform, and environmental modifications. The Be Active & Relax program will be evaluated in a modified 2 X 2 factorial design. The environmental modifications will be pre-stratified and GMI will be randomised on department level. The program will be evaluated, using 4 arms: (1) GMI and environmental modifications; (2) environmental modifications; (3) GMI; (4) no intervention (control group). Questionnaire data on the primary outcome (need for recovery) and secondary outcomes (daily physical activity, sedentary behaviour, relaxation/detachment, work- and health-related factors) will be gathered at baseline (T0), at 6 months (T1), and at 12 months (T2) follow-up. In addition, an economic and a process evaluation will be performed.DISCUSSIONReducing the need for recovery is hypothesized to be beneficial for employees, employers and society. It is assumed that there will be a reduction in need for recovery after 6 months and 12 months in the intervention group, compared to the control group.

Journal of Physical Activity & Health 12(1","Background: Research is needed to better understand the associations between during-work and after-work-hours physical activity and relaxation and need for recovery (NFR), so a study of these variables in office workers at a financial service provider was undertaken. Methods: Self-reported baseline data of 412 employees (mean age = 41.3 y; 39.6% women) were used. Linear regression analyses were performed to test associations of physical activity, relaxation, detachment, and breaks at work with NFR. Results: A lower NFR was significantly positively associated with standing, stair climbing, active lunch break, relaxation at work, detachment at work, physical detachment at work, relaxation at home, and detachment at home. In the multiple model, a lower NFR was independently positively associated with frequency of stair climbing, minutes spent in leisure activities, detachment at work, physical detachment at work, and relaxation and detachment at home (P < .05). Significant effect modification indicated that the positive association between relaxation at home and NFR was stronger with high job demands. Conclusion: Although prospective evidence is necessary to confirm the causal relationships, our findings suggest that engaging in stair climbing, leisure activities, (physical) detachment at work, relaxation and detachment after work is associated with a lower NFR. For future work site health promotion initiatives, interventions might be targeted at improving physical activity and relaxation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,16

Journal of the Royal Society, Interface 11(97","The remarkable ability of some plants and animals to cling strongly to substrates despite relatively weak interfacial bonds has important implications for the development of synthetic adhesives. Here, we examine the origins of large detachment forces using a thin elastomer tape adhered to a glass slide via van der Waals interactions, which serves as a model system for geckos, mussels and ivy. The forces required for peeling of the tape are shown to be a strong function of the angle of peeling, which is a consequence of frictional sliding at the edge of attachment that serves to dissipate energy that would otherwise drive detachment. Experiments and theory demonstrate that proper accounting for frictional sliding leads to an inferred work of adhesion of only approximately 0.5 J m(-2) (defined for purely normal separations) for all load orientations. This starkly contrasts with the interface energies inferred using conventional interface fracture models that assume pure sticking behaviour, which are considerably larger and shown to depend not only on the mode-mixity, but also on the magnitude of the mode-I stress intensity factor. The implications for developing frameworks to predict detachment forces in the presence of interface sliding are briefly discussed.",1,17

The resulting surfaces were characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and goniometry. The developed pNIPAM surfaces were further adapted by incorporation of 5-acrylamidofluorescein to generate fluorescent pNIPAM-coated surfaces. Both types of surfaces (fluorescent and nonfluorescent) sustained cellular attachment and produced cellular detachment of ∼90%, and are therefore suitable for the generation of cell sheets for engineered tissues and other purposes.

European biophysics journal : EBJ 38(8","We present experiments involving cancer cells adhering to microchannels, subjected to increasing shear stresses (0.1-30 Pa). Morphological studies were carried out at different shear stresses. Cells exhibit spreading patterns similar to those observed under static conditions, as long as the shear stress is not too high. At critical wall shear stresses (around 2-5 Pa), cell-substrate contact area decreases until detachment at the larger stresses. Critical shear stresses are found to be lower for higher confinements (i.e. smaller cell height to channel height ratio). Fluorescent techniques were used to locate focal adhesions (typically 1 lm(2) in size) under various shearing conditions, showing that cells increase the number of focal contacts in the region facing the flow. To analyze such data, we propose a model to determine the critical stress, resulting from the competition between hydrodynamic forces and the adhesive cell resistance. With this model, typical adhesive stresses exerted at each focal contact can be determined and are in agreement with previous works.",1,19

We tested the hypothesized model by surveying 547 working adults at 3 points in time over a 2-month period. Psychological detachment fully mediated the relationship between workload and fatigue; psychological detachment did not moderate this relationship. Fatigue partially mediated the relationship between psychological detachment and procrastination. Further, workload was indirectly related to procrastination 2 months later through relationships with psychological detachment and fatigue.

Distraction guides attention to a secondary task. Reinterpretation, a variant of cognitive reappraisal, works by changing the meaning of an emotional stimulus. Detachment, another reappraisal strategy, refers to distancing oneself from an emotional stimulus, thereby reducing its personal relevance. Expressive Suppression modifies the behavioral or physiological response to an emotional stimulus. These four strategies are not equally effective in terms of emotion regulation success and have been shown to partly rely on different neuronal systems. Here, we compare for the first time the neural mechanisms of these typical strategies directly in a common functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of downregulation of negative emotions. Our results indicate that three of those strategies (Detachment, Expressive Suppression and Distraction) conjointly increase brain activation in a right prefronto-parietal regulation network and significantly reduce activation of the left amygdala. Compared to the other regulation strategies, Reinterpretation specifically recruited a different control network comprising left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus and was not effective in downregulation of the amygdala. We conclude that Detachment, Distraction and Expressive Suppression recruit very similar emotion regulation networks, whereas Reinterpretation is associated with activation of a qualitatively different network, making this regulation strategy a special one. Notably, Reinterpretation also proved to be the least effective strategy in neural terms, as measured by downregulation of amygdala activation.

Health Psychology 34(Suppl","Objective: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of an Internet-based intervention, which aimed to improve recovery from work-related strain in teachers with sleeping problems and work-related rumination. In addition, mechanisms of change were also investigated. Methods: A sample of 128 teachers with elevated symptoms of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] ≥ 15) and work-related rumination (Cognitive Irritation Scale ≥ 15) was assigned to either an Internet-based recovery training (intervention condition [IC]) or to a waitlist control condition (CC). The IC consisted of 6 Internet-based sessions that aimed to promote healthy restorative behavior. Self-report data were assessed at baseline and again after 8 weeks. Additionally, a sleep diary was used starting 1 week before baseline and ending 1 week after postassessment. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included perseverative cognitions (i.e., work-related rumination and worrying), a range of recovery measures and depression. An extended 6-month follow-up was assessed in the IC only. A serial multiple mediator analysis was carried out to investigate mechanisms of change. Results: IC participants displayed a significantly greater reduction in insomnia severity (d = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.99–1.77) than did participants of the CC. The IC was also superior with regard to changes in all investigated secondary outcomes. Effects were maintained until a naturalistic 6-month follow-up. Effects on insomnia severity were mediated by both a reduction in perseverative cognitions and sleep effort. Additionally, a greater increase in number of recovery activities per week was found to be associated with lower perseverative cognitions that in turn led to a greater reduction in insomnia severity. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the efficacy of an unguided, Internet-based occupational recovery training and provided first evidence for a number of assumed mechanisms of change.

Methods: One-hundred and fifty teachers with elevated depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D ≥ 16) were assigned to either the iPST or WLC group. The iPST consisted of five lessons, including problem-solving and rumination techniques. Symptoms were assessed before the intervention began and in follow-up assessments after seven weeks, three months, and six months. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (CES-D). Secondary outcomes included general and work-specific self-efficacy, perceived stress, pathological worries, burnout symptoms, general physical and mental health, and absenteeism. Results: iPST participants displayed a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms after the intervention (d = 0.59, 95% CI 0.26–0.92), after three months (d = 0.37, 95% CI 0.05–0.70) and after six months (d = 0.38, 95% CI 0.05–0.70) compared to the control group.

Objective: To explore salutogenic work-related factors among primary health care employees. Method: Questionnaire to all employees (n = 599) from different professions in public and private primary health care centers in one health care district in Sweden. The questionnaire, which had a salutogenic perspective, included information on self-rated health from the previously validated SHIS (Salutogenic Health Indicator Scale), psychosocial work environment and experiences, recovery, leadership, social climate, reflection and work-life balance. Results: The response rate was 84%. A multivariable linear regression model, with SHIS as the dependent variable, showed three significant predictors. Recovery had the highest relationship to SHIS ( β = 0.34), followed by experience of work-life balance (β = 0.25) and work experiences ( β = 0.20). Increased experience of recovery during working hours related to higher self-rated health independent of recovery outside work. Conclusion: Individual experiences of work, work-life balance and, most importantly, recovery seem to be essential areas for health promotion. Recovery outside the workplace has been studied previously, but since recovery during work was shown to be of great importance in relation to higher self-rated health, more research is needed to explore different recovery strategies in the workplace.

Very long range hydrophobic forces were not observed in hydrophilic-hydrophobic systems. Nevertheless, the jump into contact was found to occur at distances greater that those predicted by just van der Waals attraction. The interaction between two hydrophobic surfaces was dominated by the long-range attraction due to hydrophobic forces. This interaction was found to be sensitive to the type of substrate as well as to the pH and electrolyte concentration. Measured pull-off forces showed poor reproducibility. However, average values showed clear trends and were used to estimate interfacial energies or work of adhesion for all systems studied by means of the Derjaguin approximation. These values were compared to those calculated by the surface tension component theory using the acid-base approach. Good qualitative agreement was obtained, giving support for the usefulness of this approach in estimating interfacial energies between surfaces in liquid media.

The detachment (or rupture) forces are measured as a function of the retraction velocity and exhibit a clear dependence on this parameter, even though the interaction between the molecules and the surface are nonspecific. To interpret these data, a mechanical multi-bead-and-spring model is developed. It consists of one to several parallel, ""molecular"" springs connected to an extra spring representing the cantilever that is moved at constant velocity. The free end of each molecular spring terminates with a particle that interacts with the surface through a Lennard-Jones potential. This Brownian dynamics model is used to analyze the experimental findings. In the framework of this model, it appears that the fibrinogen molecule must be ascribed a stiffness much smaller than that of the cantilever. In addition, several bonds between the molecule and the surface must be taken into account for the range of the molecule-surface interaction not to be unrealistically small. In future work, this model will be extended to more complex mechanisms such as the detachment of cells from a surface.",1,35

A microscopic view of the detachment of the adhesive shows that after cavity growth and expansion, well adhered soft adhesives form a network of fibrils connected to expanded contacting feet which fail via a sliding mechanism, sensitive to interfacial shear stresses rather than by a fracture mechanism as sometimes suggested in earlier work. A mechanical model of this stretching and sliding failure phenomenon is presented which treats the fibril as a nonlinear elastic or viscoelastic rod and the foot as an elastic layer subject to a friction force proportional to the local displacement rate. The force on the stretched rod drives the sliding of the foot against the substrate. The main experimental parameter controlling the failure strain and stress during the sliding process is identified by the model as the normalized probe pull speed, which also depends on the magnitude of the friction and PSA modulus. In addition, the material properties, viscoelasticity and finite extensibility of the polymer chains, are shown to have an important effect on both the details of the sliding process and the ultimate failure strain and stress.",1,36

Sociology of Health & Illness 40(5","This article reports an ethnographic study of the handover routines in Germany's first dementia village, with a central focus on how care is balanced between domestic intimacy and institutional detachment. The term 'professionalised intimacy' is used for the vivid interplay between comfort and intimacy that renders the interaction between care workers and residents far more complex than previous theories have articulated. Because of the intimacy involved in community building, however, the promise of personalised care must clash with the bureaucratic structures of an official institution, potentially depriving the care workers of their public, respected identity in the process. The study further suggests that most care workers, in fact, support this division between domestic intimacy and institutional detachment. Even if they subscribe to a dementia village's philosophy of personalised care, their medical training and enculturation has endowed them with a habitus compatible with the modern health profession, with incentives on achieving quantifiable health goals. The dementia village is thus illustrated as a pioneering health care experiment that negotiates rivalling discourses of intimacy, professionalisation, and medicalisation.",1,37

Furthermore, this study extends extant research that has documented beneficial effects of mindfulness on subsequent recovery experiences by arguing that the relationship between mindfulness and recovery experiences is reciprocal rather than unidirectional. Using an experience‐sampling design across five workdays and involving three daily measurement occasions, we found that sleep quality and workload were related to subsequent levels of mindfulness.

Journal of Sleep Research 27(6","Sleep reactivity is the trait‐like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift‐work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress‐related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost‐effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift‐work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long‐term prospective associations with insomnia and shift‐work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non‐sleep disorders.

The aim of this work was to study the influence of drug concentration on the adhesion between drug and carrier and on the drug detachment from the carrier. The study was done with formoterol fumarate and fluticasone propionate blended with lactose Lactohale 200. To assess the adhesion of respirable-sized drug to carrier particles, a simple method was developed based on aspiration and considering the whole blend as it is used in dry powder inhalers. Adhesion characteristics were evaluated by submitting the mixtures to a sieving action by air depression with an Alpine air-jet sieve. Aerodynamic evaluation of fine particle dose and emitted dose was obtained using a Twin Stage Impinger (TSI). Drug concentration of powder blends used in dry powder inhalers influenced adhesion, content uniformity and in vitro deposition of the drug. For the higher concentration of formoterol, it seemed that a lower quantity of drug adhered to the lactose. This was confirmed by the aerosolization assays done in the TSI. The fine particle fraction increased linearly with the formoterol concentration. A correlation was observed between adhesion characteristics and inertial impaction. In the case of fluticasone, the influence of the concentration was different. First, the fine particle fraction increased with the concentration and then decreased with a further increase of the fluticasone concentration. This could be explained by the lack of homogeneity when the fluticasone concentration was high because of agglomerates of pure drug which can not be redispersed, or by the physico-chemical characteristics of this drug.",1,47

However, this function of recovery has been neglected in research regarding the influence of work-related risk factors on low back pain (LBP) development. The aim of this prospective study was to examine the function of psychological detachment—a relevant recovery experience—concerning the influence of psychosocial work factors on LBP development. A moderating function of detachment for the interplay of work factors and LBP was assumed. Material and Methods: Sixty pain-free administrative employees of German universities completed an online survey 3 times during a 6-month period. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate risk-factors of LBP. Results: Analyses revealed an increased chance of LBP development for smokers and a decreasing chance when work resources were high. Detachment had no direct influence on LBP development, although it moderated the influence of work stressors and work resources on LBP. On the one hand, high detachment values seem to protect against an increased chance of LBP development when employees were confronted with high work stressors, while on the other hand high detachment values enhance the protective effect of high work resources. Conclusions: The results indicated a moderating role of detachment concerning the influence of psychosocial work factors on LBP development. Therefore, it is necessary to include recovery processes in future research regarding LBP development and consequently in LBP prevention concepts.

Participants (N = 52) reporting elevated scores on an emotion-related impulsivity measure completed cognitive control training targeting working memory and response inhibition. A subset of participants were randomized to a waitlist control group. Impulsivity, emotion regulation, and performance on near and far-transfer cognitive tasks were assessed at baseline and after completion of training. Emotion-related impulsivity declined significantly from pre-training to post-training and at two-week follow-up; improvements were not observed in the waitlist control group. A decrease in brooding rumination and an increase in reappraisal were also observed.

Educating health professionals about self-care practices throughout their careers can potentially build resilience. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of an educational intervention to improve recovery from job stress, increase satisfaction with current self-care practices and improve sleep quality.METHODSAn equivalent, randomised comparison, pretest-post-test intervention design was used to investigate the effects of a 1-day workshop (plus educational material) compared with written educational material alone, on measures of recovery experiences (i.e. psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery experiences and control over leisure), satisfaction with recovery-related self-care practices and perceived sleep quality of 70 cancer care workers.RESULTSWorkshop participants reported greater mean changes 6 weeks post-workshop for total recovery experiences (F(1,69) = 8.145, P = .008), self-care satisfaction (F(1,69) = 8.277, P = .005) and perceived sleep quality (F(1,69) = 9.611, P = .003). There was a decline in the scores of the control group over the 6-week period for all measures. Workshop participants not only avoided this decline, but demonstrated increased mean scores, with a significant main effect 6 weeks post-workshop, compared with the control group (F(3,63) = 4.262, P = .008).CONCLUSIONSA 1-day intervention workshop improved recovery skills, satisfaction with self-care practices and perceived sleep quality of oncology nurses and radiation therapists.

In this intervention study, based on the effort-recovery model and the conservation of resources theory, we examined how to enhance recovery during lunch breaks. More specifically, we examined the within-person effects of lunchtime park walks and relaxation exercises on employees’ levels of concentration, strain, and fatigue experienced at the end of a working day. We moreover tested whether detachment from work and enjoyment experienced during lunch breaks transmitted the effects of these activities to well-being outcomes. Participants in the park walk (n = 51) and relaxation (n = 46) groups were asked to complete a 15-min exercise during their lunch break on 10 consecutive working days. Afternoon well-being, lunchtime detachment, and lunchtime enjoyment were assessed twice a week before, during, and after the intervention, altogether for 5 weeks. Multilevel analysis results showed that park walks at lunchtime were related to better concentration and less fatigue in the afternoon through enjoyment. Relaxation exercises were related to better concentration in the afternoon via detachment. In addition, relaxation exercises were directly linked to lower levels of strain and fatigue in the afternoon. Our study suggests that on days on which employees engage in recovering activities during lunch breaks, they experience higher levels of well-being at the end of a working day.

The purpose of this paper is to extend this literature by examining several correlates and consequences of four recovery experiences: psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 290 nursing staff working in hospitals using a questionnaire study and well-established measures. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results suggest that the four recovery experiences were, with one exception, positively and significantly correlated. Personal demographic variables (e.g. work status and level of education) had relationships with the use of particular recovery experiences. Passion was positively related to the use of mastery and control, while work intensity was negatively associated with the use of psychological detachment and relaxation. The use of particular recovery experiences was generally associated with lower intentions to quit and positive indicators of psychological well-being. Research limitations/implications: There are several implications for research and practice. Scholars can use the results to extend the theories such as the job demands-resources model, including the role of work intensity as job demands. At the organizational level, managers and leaders should consider supporting strategies that help employees recover after work.

Methods: School teachers (N = 128) with clinically significant insomnia symptoms and work-related rumination were randomized to guided iCBT-I or a waitlist-control-group, both with access to treatment as usual. Economic data were collected at baseline and 6-mo follow-up. We conducted (1) a cost-effectiveness analysis with treatment response (Reliable Change [decline of 5.01 points] and Insomnia Severity Index < 8 at 6-month follow-up) as the outcome and (2) a cost-benefit analysis. Because both analyses were performed from the employer’s perspective, we focused specifically on absenteeism and presenteeism costs. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping. Results: Assuming intervention costs of €200 ($245), cost-effectiveness analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay of €0 for each positive treatment response, there is an 87% probability that the intervention is more cost effective than treatment as usual alone. Cost-benefit analyses led to a net benefit of €418 (95% confidence interval: -593.03 to 1,488.70) ($512) per participant and a return on investment of 208% (95% confidence interval: -296.52 to 744.35). The reduction in costs was mainly driven by the effects of the intervention on presenteeism and to a lesser degree by reduced absenteeism.

In the process of recovery from work, psychological rumination is considered to be an important mediating variable in the relationship between work demands and health outcomes. This study aimed to extend our knowledge of the process by which ICU stressors and differing rumination styles are associated with burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity among ICU professionals.METHODSNinety-six healthcare professionals (58 doctors and 38 nurses) who work in ICUs in the UK completed a questionnaire on ICU-related stressors, burnout, work-related rumination, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity.RESULTSSignificant associations between ICU stressors, affective rumination, burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity were found. Longer working hours were also related to increased ICU stressors. Affective rumination (but not problem-solving pondering or distraction detachment) mediated the relationship between ICU stressors, burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity, such that increased ICU stressors, and greater affective rumination, were associated with greater burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity. No moderating effects were observed.CONCLUSIONSLonger working hours were associated with increased ICU stressors, and increased ICU stressors conferred greater burnout, depression and risk of psychiatric morbidity via increased affective rumination. The importance of screening healthcare practitioners within intensive care for depression, burnout and psychiatric morbidity has been highlighted. Future research should evaluate psychological interventions which target rumination style and could be made available to those at highest risk.

Two indices of post-work recovery were utilized: problem solving pondering and psychological detachment. The study was conducted with 310 participants employed from diverse occupational sectors. Main effects of positive and negative appraisal of work interruption and beliefs were analysed using mediated and moderated regression analysis on problem-solving pondering and detachment. Weakened belief in wasted time as a partial mediator, reduced problem-solving pondering post work when interruptions were appraised as positive, and a high evaluation of leisure partially mediated problem-solving pondering when interruptions were appraised as positive. The results also showed that a high evaluation of centrality of work and leisure moderated the effect of negative appraisal of work interruption on elevated problem-solving pondering. Positive appraisal of work interruption was related to problem-solving pondering, and the strength of this association was further moderated by a strong belief in delay of gratification. In addition, employees' positive appraisal of work interruption was related to work detachment, and the strength of this association was further moderated by strong beliefs in hard work and self-reliance. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications for employees who are strongly influenced by such work beliefs.",1,72

Bioconjugate chemistry 29(8","Atherosclerosis is a cardiovascular disease characterized by the formation of lipid-rich plaques within the walls of large arteries. Over time, a portion of these lesions can detach and lead to serious complications, such as strokes or heart attacks. Currently, there is no clinically effective way to detect the presence of atherosclerosis in patients until it has reached a relatively advanced stage. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that the pathobiological behavior of plaques is determined mainly by their composition, and not their size, which is the parameter usually monitored with current imaging techniques. In this work, we report protein-based agents that target the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM1), a protein that plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis progression. In vivo experiments with murine atherosclerosis models indicated that the targeted protein nanoparticles were successful in detecting plaques of various sizes in the descending aorta and the aortic arch. This finding encourages the further development of these nanoscale agents for applications in the imaging, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",0,73

Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering 21(1","The clinical importance of measuring local pulse wave velocity (PWV), has encouraged researchers to develop several local methods to estimate it. In this work, we proposed a new method, the sum-of-squares method [Formula: see text], that allows the estimations of PWV by using simultaneous measurements of blood pressure (P) and arterial diameter (D) at single-location. Pulse waveforms generated by: (1) two-dimensional (2D) fluid-structure interaction simulation (FSI) in a compliant tube, (2) one-dimensional (1D) model of 55 larger human systemic arteries and (3) experimental data were used to validate the new formula and evaluate several classical methods. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by comparing its results to theoretical PWV calculated from the parameters of the model and/or to PWV estimated by several classical methods. It was found that values of PWV obtained by the developed method [Formula: see text] are in good agreement with theoretical ones and with those calculated by PA-loop and D2P-loop. The difference between the PWV calculated by [Formula: see text] and PA-loop does not exceed 1% when data from simulations are used, 3% when in vitro data are used and 5% when in vivo data are used. In addition, this study suggests that estimated PWV from arterial pressure and diameter waveforms provide correct values while methods that require flow rate (Q) and velocity (U) overestimate or underestimate PWV.",0,76

The site-specific absorption from the upper part of the small intestine and the colonic metabolism of the drug could partially contribute to its reduced bioavailability. To surmount these drawbacks, this work aimed at the formulation of Ranitidine HCl gastroretentive floating-biaodhesive tablets. A 3(2) factorial design was applied to assess the effects of matrix former (HPMC K100M): drug ratio, and the release retardant (Carbopol 971) amount on the characteristics of the tablets prepared using direct compression technique. The prepared tablets were thoroughly evaluated for physical properties, floating, swelling, bioadhesive and in vitro release behaviors. Statistical analysis of the results revealed significant effects for both formulation variables on the swelling index, maximum detachment force and cumulative percent drug released after 6 hours. In addition, the matrix- former: drug ratio showed a statistically significant effect on the floating lag time. Kinetic analysis of the release data indicated Higuchi diffusion kinetics and anomalous transport mechanism for all formulations. Scanning electron micrographs of the selected tablet formulation; F8, revealed intact surface without any perforations or channels in the dry state, while polymer expansion (relaxation) with some perforated areas were observed on the surface of the tablets after 12 hours dissolution in 0.1 N HCl. Furthermore, in vivo abdominal x-ray imaging showed good floating behavior of the selected formulation; F8, for up to 6 hours with appropriate bioadhesive property.

An extensive literature search was conducted, generating a variety of sources including research trials (randomized and non-randomized), lab-based studies, cohort studies, topical reviews, government or NGO reports and grey literature. In addition, reflection and opinion, accrued through regular interaction with families, regarding some of the potential links has also been included. Parental perception of diet quality is influenced by many different social, biological economical and psychological factors. Research suggests that diet quality of today's children is sub-optimal and a parent's perception of their child's diet may not accurately reflect this reality. Various parental attitudes and perceptions/misperceptions are important to address as knowledge awareness and beliefs can impact diet quality as can parental practices, and family structure. Issues related to socioeconomics and convenience, and a child's preferences and their peer and/or social environment are also potential factors impacting child diet quality.

Journal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine 12(1","BACKGROUNDUnderstanding how people interpret environmental change and develop practices in response to such change is essential to comprehend human resource use. In the cosmology of the American indigenous peoples, as among the Mapuche people, freshwater systems are considered a living entity, where animals have an enormous role to play in the universe of meaning. However, human adaptive responses to freshwater system dynamics are scarcely examined. In this work a survey is carried out in three Mapuche communities of Argentine Patagonia to assess their traditional knowledge of the fishes and other non-human living beings that inhabit lakes and rivers. Both material and symbolic aspects are included, as are the differences in knowledge and use of the fishes between past and present times.METHODSOur methods were based on a quali-quantitative fieldwork approach. In-depth interviews were carried out with 36 individuals from three rural Mapuche populations in Neuquén province (Patagonia, Argentina). Free listing was used for inquiring about fish knowledge and use. Fishes were identified scientifically and ethnotaxonomically. In-depth analysis of the discourses was conducted, documenting the recognition, perception, and cultural significance of fluvial environments and their inhabitants. Quantitative survey results were analyzed with categorical statistical methods.RESULTSThe body of knowledge of the communities studied reflects the socio-environmental changes experienced by Patagonian freshwater bodies. According to local perception, non-human beings live in these water bodies, guarding the environment, and they should not be disturbed. At present, five different fish species are identified, three of which are exotic, having been introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the white man. These exotic trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salvelinus fontinalis) are considered ill omens, indicators of the white man's presence, and therefore their appearance presages negative events for the families. In addition, we found that Mapuche people differentiate fish species mainly by morphological, organoleptic and ecological attributes. Current consumption of fish by Mapuche communities is sporadic, in accordance with bibliography and ancient tales. Several fishing tools are used, including modern elements.CONCLUSIONSOur data enable us to characterise dynamic traditional knowledge in these communities, which is flexible in nature and adaptable to new situations, demonstrated by the incorporation not only of new species but also new fishing tools. It also seems that new significances become absorbed in synchrony with the advance or arrival of exotic and invasive species. For the Mapuche, the presence of the white man heralded by exotic trouts speaks of how a recent event, such as the introduction of the salmonids, is already incorporated into Mapuche symbolism. Mapuche traditional knowledge and cosmovision on the use of fish and waters, a vision which promotes respect and the avoidance of actions that could disturb the beings (animals and sacred or mythological characters) that inhabit and take care of them should be fostered as part of management plans of regional natural resources. This paper contributes to the broader literature on freshwater resource management by providing empirical evidence of the critical role of local perceptions in promoting the sustainable management of natural resources.",0,86

Formulations were composed of pluronic F127 or a mix of two pluronics F127 and F68. Both formulations contained hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) as a mucoadhesive polymer. The determination of gelling temperature (T(gel)) after dilution with simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) demonstrated that hydrogels were resistant to dilution and T(gel) values were close to 30°C. Ex vivo mucoadhesion experiments conducted on porcine vaginal mucosa founded on the technique of traction of the adhesive/adherent joint allowed the characterization of mucoadhesive properties of hydrogels by measuring work of adhesion (W) and maximum force of detachment (F(max)). In the case of F127-based hydrogels, W and F(max) were lowered after dilution with SVF. However, in the case of F127/F68-based hydrogels, W, F(max) and mucoadhesion profiles were weakly affected by dilution. These differences could be attributed to the higher elasticity of F127/F68/HPMC (22.5/2.5/1% w/w) hydrogel in comparison with F127/HPMC one (20/1% w/w). Indeed, rheological analyses of the formulations showed that both elastic (G') and viscous moduli (G'') were higher for F127/F68/HPMC (22.5/2.5/1% w/w) than for F127/HPMC hydrogel (20/1% w/w).

Molecular and cellular biochemistry 256-257(1-2","The purpose of this work was the development of a basal mathematical model for the diffusion of low-molecular metabolites in a skeletal muscle cell. A three-dimension diffusion of low-molecular particles was simulated by a Monte-Carlo method (random walks of diffusing molecules). The model takes into account the following structural elements: (i) a regular lattice of actin and myosin filaments inside a myofibril; (ii) the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria surrounding the myofibrils; (iii) a set of myofibrils inside a skeletal muscle cell. We simulated diffusion of particles in the bulk of intracellular water phase and their reflections from the rigid surfaces of intracellular structures. The model allowed to calculate the apparent coefficients of particle diffusion in the axial and radial directions, Dparallel(app) and Dperpendicular(app), respectively. In accordance with experimental data from literature, the coefficient Dparallel(app) was independent of time. The coefficient of radial diffusion Dperpendicular(app) decreased with time to steady state values similar to that determined by the NMR diffusion spectroscopy methods. The interactions of diffusing particles with thin and thick filaments of myofibrils could explain the decrease in the Dperpendicular(app) value by a factor of 20%. The collisions of particles with myofilaments began to reveal themselves as a gradual decrease in the Dperpendicular(app) value at early stages of diffusion (t1/2 approximately equal to 0.05 microsec). The contribution of particle reflections from the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to the retardation of the radial diffusion was about of 20-30%, depending on porosity of a membranous shield around the myofibril. For conventional sizes of a membranous shield (diameter 2 microm), the interactions of particles with the shield caused a decrease in the Dperpendicular(app) value with a half-time t1/2 approximately equal to 0.5 msec. This time is essentially lower by a factor about of 100 than that found in published NMR measurements. When we considered diffusion of particles inside a cell compartment confined to impermeable membranous shield, the reflection of particles from this shield led the drastic decrease in the radial diffusion coefficient (Dperpendicular(app) --> porportional to when t --> porportional to). This pattern of the Dperpendicular(app)(t) time-course might be expected in the NMR measurements on skeletal muscle tissue where a sarcolemma represents an impermeable shield for ATP and PCr molecules.",0,89

Results were compared with previously published experimental data on ASM oscillations. The model confirms a trend observed in the experimental data which shows that: (i) the value of tissue length change is the most important factor to determine the degree of cross-bridge detachment and (ii) a strong correlation exists between increasing frequency and declining stiffness until a certain frequency (~25 Hz) beyond which frequency dependence is negligible. Although the model was not intended to simulate biophysical events individually, the data could be explained by cross-bridge cycling rates. As the frequency increases, cross-bridge reattachment becomes less likely, until no further cross-bridge attachment is possible.",0,91

There are huge gaps in quality of life between Arab and Jewish Israelis. Such social inequities, as well as other issues such as polygamy, have been identified as risk factors for psychological distress. This situation puts the Israeli Arab, like other post-colonial peoples, in an attitude of ambivalence towards modern mental health services. On the one hand, certain forms of intervention, particularly medicinal, may improve peoples' lives. On the other, mental health services, as part of the colonial process, continue to present limited cultural sensitivity towards Arab peoples. A cultural gap leading to mistrust is a given when a non-Arab mental health provider comes into contact with an Arab client. Religious beliefs, the importance of the family and the stigma attached to mental health problems have substantial influence on the Arab's perception and reaction toward mental health problems and their treatment. The expression of conflict and negative feelings are not well accepted within Arab culture. For this reason, mental illness is often denied and kept away from professional help or expressed as a physical illness. There is also a difficulty for a male being treated by a female and for the individual to ask for help outside his family or community. Arab Muslims also generally have a tendency to resign themselves to God's care and thus may neglect or deny symptoms. Another tendency is the preference for using traditional healers and folk medicine. Other problems in mental health work are the passive attitude of the patient and the degree of authority vested in the therapist. To facilitate bridging this cultural gap, the therapist's first task is that of educating him/her self about the religious, cultural and national background of the client. Cultural competence and self-reflection are key components to effective cultural practice.",0,92

The introduction of universal umbilical artery lactate (UA) measurements in this setting may improve outcomes by providing an objective measurement of quality of care and stimulating case reflection, audit, and practice change. It is important that consideration is given to the barriers and facilitators to implementing this tool outside of a research setting.METHODSDuring the period 16/11/2014 -13/01/2015, we conducted a training course in cardiotocograph (CTG) interpretation, fetal physiology, and the sampling and analysing of UA lactate, with a pre and post questionnaire aimed at assessing the barriers and facilitators to the introduction of universal UA lactate in a district hospital in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.RESULTSThirty-five pre-training questionnaires available (overall response rate 95 %) and 22 post training questionnaires (response rate 63 %) were available for analysis. Prior to training, the majority gave positive responses (strongly agree or agree) that measuring UA lactate assists neonatal care, is protective for staff medicolegally, and improves opportunities for audit and teaching of maternity practice (n = 33, 30, 32; 94.4 %, 85.7 %, 91.4 % respectively). Respondents remained positive about the benefits post training. An increased workload on medical or midwifery staff was less likely to be seen as barrier following training (71 vs. 38.9 % positive response, p = 0.038).

An operations management consultant, using 'lean' principles developed in industry, worked alongside staff to redesign the service. Results: Improvements in staff capacity and ability contributed to more care episodes and reduced ward-stay times, compensating for the impact of a ward closure. Re-examination of individuals needs through case review led to the development of 'patient typing', facilitating clear care pathways according to need. Finally, two proven modalities of community-based service were fused together.

Whereas using several trials overcomes some of the limitations of a single-trial framework (Prentice, 1989, Statistics in Medicine 8, 431-440), arguably the evaluation of surrogate endpoints can never be done using only statistical evidence but such evidence should be seen as but one component in a decision-making process that involves, among others, a number of clinical and biological considerations.

Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists","INTRODUCTIONPatients experiencing flashes and floaters commonly present to their optometrist. Some of these patients may have significant pathology, yet there is a great deal of variability with regard to examination technique and referral practice.METHODSA questionnaire survey was undertaken to determine the current management of patients presenting to their optometrist with flashes and floaters. All practising community optometrists within Southern Derbyshire received a questionnaire and 74 (56.9%) completed replies were received.RESULTSOptometrists estimated that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of flashes and/or floaters. Mydriasis was utilised routinely for examination in approximately half of the patients. Mean relative confidence was 2.0 at identifying a vitreous haemorrhage and 6.5 for vitreous pigment (complete confidence = 0, complete lack of confidence = 10). Eight percent of responders were unfamiliar with the clinical sign of vitreous pigment, and 17% identifying this sign did not refer all such patients to the hospital services.CONCLUSIONSPatients presenting to their optometrists with flashes and/or floaters make up a sizeable part of the community optometrist's workload and the management of these patients is highly variable. A large proportion of these patients are examined without mydriasis, even in the presence of various risk factors for retinal detachment. There is a relative lack of confidence amongst optometrists with regards the detection of vitreous pigment and the prognostic implications of this finding. Educational measures such as study days may help the level of understanding and heighten the appreciation of the implications of flashes and floaters and the various clinical signs encountered.",0,97

The results support the possibility of vital sign detection based on the magnitude variation of the reflection coefficient from an antenna, which can be explained as a narrowband modulation scheme. In particular, a sensitivity enhancement method is proposed and analyzed, and experiments are carried out for heartbeat detection using a dipole antenna with the proposed system. Experimental results are compared between the direct detection and sensitivity enhancement detection schemes.

Recent studies have reported the efficacy of stem cell therapy in nephropathy animal models.AIM OF THE WORKThis study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) versus losartan in the treatment of renal alterations induced by adriamycin (ADR).MATERIALS AND METHODSThirty-five adult male albino rats were divided into four groups. Group I was the control group. Group II (adriamycin-treated group),which included ten rats that were injected with a single dose of adriamycin (15 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, was subdivided into subgroup IIa and IIb and they were sacrificed 1 week and 5 weeks after adriamycin injection, respectively. Group III was the adriamycin + losartan-treated group and 1 week after adriamycin injection five rats received 10 mg/kg of losartan orally and daily for 4 weeks. Group IV was the adriamycin + MSC-treated group); five rats were injected with adriamycin as group II then supplied with MSCs at a dose of 1 × 10(6) cells suspended in 0.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per rat in the tail vein 1 week after adriamycin injection. Rats of this group were sacrificed 4 weeks after the stem cell injection. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were measured. Samples from renal cortex were processed for light and electron microscope examination. As regards light microscope, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H-E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), masson trichrome, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Caspase-3 immunohistochemical stains. Morphometrical and statistical analyses were also conducted.RESULTSExamination of adriamycin-treated group revealed deterioration of renal functions and various degrees of renal structural alterations as vacuolated cytoplasm, dark nuclei and detached epithelial lining. Administration of losartan partially improved ADR-induced kidney dysfunction, whereas MSCs denoted a more ameliorative role evidenced by structural and functional recovery.CONCLUSIONMSCs have a relevant therapeutic potential against ADR-induced renal damage. MSCs may accomplish this role by decreasing caspase-3 expression and increasing proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining which influence the regeneration of the kidney.",0,100

Acta biomaterialia 57: 115-126.","Muscular disease has debilitating effects with severe damage leading to death. Our knowledge of muscle biology, disease and treatment is largely derived from non-human cell models, even though non-human cells are known to differ from human cells in their biochemical responses. Attempts to develop highly sought after in vitro human cell models have been plagued by early cell delamination and difficulties in achieving human myotube culture in vitro. In this work, we developed polyurethane acrylate (PUA) materials to support long-term in vitro culture of human skeletal muscle tissue. Using a constant base with modulated crosslink density we were able to vary the material modulus while keeping surface chemistry and roughness constant. While previous studies have focused on materials that mimic soft muscle tissue with stiffness ca. 12kPa, we investigated materials with tendon-like surface moduli in the higher 150MPa to 2.4GPa range, which has remained unexplored. We found that PUA of an optimal modulus within this range can support human myoblast proliferation, terminal differentiation and sustenance beyond 35days, without use of any extracellular protein coating. Results show that PUA materials can serve as effective substrates for successful development of human skeletal muscle cell models and are suitable for long-term in vitro studies.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe developed polyurethane acrylates (PUA) to modulate the human skeletal muscle cell growth and maturation in vitro by controlling surface chemistry, morphology and tuning material's stiffness. PUA was able to maintain muscle cell viability for over a month without any detectable signs of material degradation. The best performing PUA prevented premature cell detachment from the substrate which often hampered long-term muscle cell studies. It also supported muscle cell maturation up to the late stages of differentiation. The significance of these findings lies in the possibility to advance studies on muscle cell biology, disease and therapy by using human muscle cells instead of relying on the widely used animal-based in vitro models.",0,101

Sensors (Basel, Switzerland","In this study, the evaluation of the accuracy and performance of a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor for vegetation using distance and reflection measurements aiming to detect and discriminate maize plants and weeds from soil surface was done. The study continues a previous work carried out in a maize field in Spain with a LIDAR sensor using exclusively one index, the height profile. The current system uses a combination of the two mentioned indexes. The experiment was carried out in a maize field at growth stage 12-14, at 16 different locations selected to represent the widest possible density of three weeds: Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.Beauv., Lamium purpureum L., Galium aparine L.and Veronica persica Poir.. A terrestrial LIDAR sensor was mounted on a tripod pointing to the inter-row area, with its horizontal axis and the field of view pointing vertically downwards to the ground, scanning a vertical plane with the potential presence of vegetation. Immediately after the LIDAR data acquisition (distances and reflection measurements), actual heights of plants were estimated using an appropriate methodology. For that purpose, digital images were taken of each sampled area. Data showed a high correlation between LIDAR measured height and actual plant heights (R2 = 0.75). Binary logistic regression between weed presence/absence and the sensor readings (LIDAR height and reflection values) was used to validate the accuracy of the sensor. This permitted the discrimination of vegetation from the ground with an accuracy of up to 95%. In addition, a Canonical Discrimination Analysis (CDA) was able to discriminate mostly between soil and vegetation and, to a far lesser extent, between crop and weeds. The studied methodology arises as a good system for weed detection, which in combination with other principles, such as vision-based technologies, could improve the efficiency and accuracy of herbicide spraying.",0,102

Serum levels of vitamin D were measured after 6 weeks. These vitamin D-deficient animals (experimental group) plus 32 rats with normal vitamin D levels (controls) underwent unilateral detachment of the right supraspinatus tendon from the greater tuberosity of the humerus, followed by immediate repair using bone tunnel suture fixation. The animals were sacrificed at 2- and 4-week intervals after surgery for biomechanical analysis. A paired t test was used to compare serum vitamin D levels at day 0 and at 6 weeks. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare load-to-failure and stiffness values between the experimental group and controls. Bone density and new bone formation at the tendon insertion site on the greater tuberosity were assessed with micro-computed tomography (CT). The organization of collagen tissue, new bone formation, vascularity at the tendon-bone interface, fibrocartilage at the tendon-bone interface, and collagen fiber continuity between the tendon and bone tissue were evaluated with safranin O and picrosirius red staining.RESULTSBlood draws confirmed vitamin D deficiency at 6 weeks compared with time zero/baseline for rats in the experimental group (10.9 ng/mL vs 6.5 ng/mL, respectively; P < .001). Biomechanical testing demonstrated a significant decrease in load to failure in the experimental group compared with controls at 2 weeks (5.8 ± 2.0 N vs 10.5 ± 4.4 N, respectively; P < .006). There was no difference in stiffness at 2 weeks between the control and experimental groups. At 4 weeks, there was no significant difference in load to failure or stiffness between the control and experimental groups. Histological analysis showed less bone formation and less collagen fiber organization in the vitamin D-deficient specimens at 4 weeks as compared with controls. Micro-CT analysis showed no significant difference between groups for total mineral density and bone volume fraction of cortical, whole, or trabecular bone at 4 weeks.CONCLUSIONThe biomechanical and histological data from this study suggest that low vitamin D levels may negatively affect early healing at the rotator cuff repair site.CLINICAL RELEVANCEIt is estimated that 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient. In the deficient state, acutely injured rotator cuffs may have a reduced ability for tendon healing. Further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanism by which vitamin D affects tendon healing and whether vitamin D supplementation can improve rotator cuff tendon healing and reduce the incidence of retears.",0,103

In phase 1 the authors investigated the role of the TMJ disc and in phase 2 the authors evaluated 3 different interposal materials. The present work of TEMPOJIMS - phase 1, investigated the effects of bilateral discectomy and discopexy in sheep mastication and rumination. METHODS: This randomized, blinded and controlled preclinical trial (in line with the ARRIVE guidelines) was conducted in 9 Black Merino sheep to evaluate changes in mastication and rumination after bilateral discectomy and bilateral discopexy, by comparing with a sham surgery control group. The outcomes evaluated were: (1) absolute masticatory time; (2) ruminant time per cycle; (3) ruminant kinematics, and (4) ruminant area. After baseline evaluation and surgical interventions, the outcomes were recorded over 3 successive days, every 30 days, for 6 months. RESULTS: The first month after intervention seemed to be the critical period for significant kinematic changes in the discectomy and discopexy groups. However, 6 months after the bilateral interventions, no significant changes were noticed when compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, bilateral discectomy and discopexy had no significant effect in mastication and ruminatory movement. The introduction of kinematic evaluation presents a new challenge that may contribute to the improvement of future studies on the TMJ domain.",0,104

In this paper we demonstrate that wavelength dependent DR measurements enable the spectral red-shift observation of highly concentrated GNR. By conjugating targeting moieties to the GNR, large density of GNR can specifically home onto cancer cells. The inter-particle plasmon resonance pattern of the highly concentrated GNR leads to an extension and a red-shift (Δλ) in the absorption spectrum of the concentrated GNR. Dark-field microscopy was used in order to measure the expected Δλ in different GNR concentrations in vitro. Double-wavelength DR measurements of tissue-like phantoms and tumor bearing mice containing different GNR concentrations are presented. We show that the DR profile of the highly concentrated GNR directly correlate with the spectral extension and red-shift.

Patients and methods: A single-center, retrospective study was carried out on the medical records of 82 patients aged 85 years and older who had undergone PPV from 2006 to 2013. Patients ranged in age from 86 to 99 years, with a mean age of 88.9 years (+/-2.88). Visual results and intraoperative and postoperative complications were the main outcome measures. Visual improvement/worsening was defined as at least +/-0.1 logMAR change. Results: Mean follow-up was 7.25 months (+/-5.35), with a range of 1-28 months. General anesthesia was used in 63% of the operations. The most common indication was retinal detachment (27%). The ocular condition necessitating PPV was secondary to trauma (most commonly after a fall) in 10 eyes (12%). Mean visual acuity (VA) improved from 1/58 preoperatively to 1/29 at the final evaluation (p=0.014). Mean improvement in VA in eyes of patients with the comorbidity of age-related macular degeneration (n=34) was 41% lower compared to eyes of patients without the disease (n=48, p=0.013). In the subgroup of patients operated on for retinal detachment, 45.4% did not reach primary anatomic success and 45.4% needed additional retina-affecting surgery. One or more major ocular complications were reported in 24 eyes (29%), while 19 eyes (23%) had minor ocular complications. Conclusion: Improved VA was documented in more than half of the older adults aged 85-99 undergoing vitrectomy. Despite the rate of complications in the very elderly, the possibility of optimizing visual function may positively affect quality of life in this subgroup.",0,106

Methods During Balint seminars, a family medicine resident presents a troubling case which all group members reflect upon from the perspective of the doctor, the patient, and their relationship. Balint leaders later debrief and review the work of the group. Lebanon has passed through many political, social, and religious conflicts and was affected by the onset of the Syrian Civil War in 2010. The Balint leaders had begun to see in resident case presentations reflections of war's disruption of the doctor-patient relationship. Two Balint leaders reviewed a log of all the cases between 2013 and 2016. Results In our observations, the discussion of the presented cases mirrored the cultural, social, religious, and political context of the country. First, the political situation was reflected in the dynamics of the group: agitation, conflicts, hopelessness, and a search for norms. Second, the residents subconsciously chose words in their discussion that reflect the country's situation. Third, the presented case was stirred by a tragic war-related event. Conclusions The social/political/religious context in which the physician is practicing distracts the doctor from fulfilling his/her professional role. Balint seminars are an example of direct, experiential learning that provide an excellent opportunity for the special training of primary care physicians who deal with refugees and citizens to self-reflect on war's impact on them and their profession.",0,107

Concentrated aqueous solutions containing 25 wt % polymer were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). DSC measurements show that, during the demixing phase transition, the hydration number per oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain in the PS- b-PMDEGA solution decreases rather gradually, even up to 20 °C above the onset of the transition, i.e., the cloud point (CP). In contrast, the PS- b-PNIPAM solution exhibits an abrupt, stepwise dehydration behavior at its CP, indicated by the sharp, narrow endothermic peak. BDS measurements suggest that the organization of the expelled water during the phase transition and the subsequent evolution of the micellar aggregates are different for the two copolymers. In the PS- b-PMDEGA solution, the long-range charge transport process changes significantly at its CP and strong interfacial polarization processes appear, probably due to charge accumulation at the interfaces between the micellar aggregates and the aqueous medium. On the contrary, in the PS- b-PNIPAM solution, the phase transition has only a marginal effect on the long-range conduction process and is accompanied by a reduction in the high-frequency (1 MHz) dielectric permittivity, ε'. The latter effect is attributed to the reduced polarization strength of local chain modes due to an enhancement of intra- and interchain hydrogen bonds (HBs) in the polymer-rich phase during the water detaching process. Surprisingly, our BDS measurements indicate that prior to both the demixing and remixing processes the local chain mobility increases temporally. Our dielectric studies suggest that for PS- b-PNIPAM the water detaching process initiates a few degrees below CP and that the local chain mobility and intra- and/or interchain HBs of the PNIPAM blocks may control its thermoresponsive behavior. Dielectric ""jump"" experiments show that the kinetics of micellar aggregation in the PS- b-PMDEGA solution is slower than that in the PS- b-PNIPAM solution and is independent of the target temperature within the two-phase region. From the experimental point of view, it is shown that the dielectric susceptibility, especially, the dielectric permittivity, ε', is a well-suited probe for monitoring both the reversible changes in the molecular dipolar bond polarizability and the long-range interfacial polarization at the phase transition.",0,114

Following our previous studies, this work systemically evaluates the performance of a two-layer model-based reconstruction using the finite element method, and compares it with the performance of the semi-infinite model. The results obtained from simulations and phantom experiments show that the two-layer model improves the light quantification of the targets. The improvements are attributed to improved background estimation and more accurate weight matrix calculation using a two-layer model compared to the semi-infinite model. Fitted two-layer background optical properties obtained from a group of ten patients with chest walls located less than 2 cm deep are more representative of breast tissue and chest-wall optical properties.",0,115

Toxicology 203(1-3","As an extension of our previous investigations on sunscreen ingredients, the present work was aimed at assessing the possible protective effects of a common UVA-absorbing agent, Parsol 1789 (4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane) in contact with human keratinocytes under UVA illumination. Cell viability was evaluated by determining lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, uptake of propidium iodide and fluorescein diacetate, total protein content and percentage of cell detachment. Apoptosis was detected by recognition of translocated phosphatidylserine using annexin V-FITC uptake. Oxidative stress was evaluated through the carboxy-H2DCFDA assay while the total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay was used for determining the total antioxidant capacity level in these cells. Lipid peroxidation was also assessed by checking hydroperoxide (HP) levels. The results obtained show that UVA exposure induces significant cell mortality, decrease in protein concentration, release of LDH, increase in apoptosis, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation with a concomitant reduction in the response of the antioxidant cellular defense system. The presence of 10 microM Parsol 1789 did not minimize these UVA-induced effects, on the contrary, for some parameters measured such as lipid hydroperoxides, there was a significant enhancement. Furthermore, the presence of glutathione (GSH) alone decreased the level of ROS and lipid hydroperoxides, but in combination with Parsol 1789, this protective effect was reduced. The overall results indicate that the compound does not protect these cells from UVA exposure under our experimental conditions confirming previous findings on the lack of photoprotective efficiency of this sunscreen in contact with biologically relevant molecules. However, the biological role and significance of these results to the consequences of sunscreen use in humans are not known, hence extrapolation from laboratory experiments must be done with caution.",0,116

Family Practice 29(4","Background: The UK Cervical Screening Programme, delivered mostly through primary care, commands impressive levels of public support. However, considerable evidence suggests that women find the experience of screening problematic. Objective: To investigate this tension using women’s accounts of cervical screening, with a view to informing practice to better meet their needs. Methods: A qualitative interview study with 34 participants focussed on their experiences and understandings of cervical cancer screening in the UK. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method. Results: The highly intimate and personal nature of the test is challenging, and many women report unsatisfactory experiences. Problematic issues include: embarrassment and discomfort (sometimes severe) in exposing an intimate and personal part of their body; surrendering control and finding the test painful, uncomfortable and personally threatening. Though there is an important role for primary health care professionals in easing discomfort and facilitating positive experiences, women often report feeling disappointed with how the procedure is conducted. Women suggest that practitioners’ attempts to normalize the interaction and maintain a degree of detachment could have the perverse effect of making them feel more uncomfortable and that more personalization would be welcome. Conclusions: This work identifies the ways in which women may find personal engagement with cervical screening difficult and demonstrates the important role of primary care practitioners in contributing to women’s experiences of the encounter. We draw on Erving Goffman’s work on the ‘interaction order’ to explain some of the problems reported by women and to help inform good practice in primary care.

Developing world bioethics 10(3","The number of people in immediate need of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in the southern African region continues to significantly exceed the capacity of health systems there to provide it. Approaches to this complex rationing dilemma have evolved in different directions. The ethical concepts of fairness and equity have been suggested as a basis to guide the development of approaches to select patients for ART. This article reports the results of a case study on patient selection at a rural ART clinic in Lesotho. The purpose of the study was to examine whether or not such concepts had relevance or operative value for a treatment team providing ART in rural Lesotho. The study found that while concepts of fairness and equity were relevant to the work of the treatment team, patient selection practices did not necessarily reflect what these concepts entail. The idea of fairness as a structured, formalized selection process did not figure in the approach to ART provision at the site. A less formal, 'first-come-first-served' approach was adopted. While there was knowledge among some team members that social, economic or geographic conditions inhibit individuals and groups from gaining access to ART and that this was inequitable, it was felt that there was little they could do to try to mediate the impact of these conditions. The study's findings pose importance questions about the approach to ART programming in resource constrained settings. The findings also question the relevance of trying to achieve fairness and equity when the gap between need for care and capacity to provide it remains so large.",0,118

Biophysical journal 107(8","Intracellular cargo transport frequently involves multiple motor types, either having opposite directionality or having the same directionality but different speeds. Although significant progress has been made in characterizing kinesin motors at the single-molecule level, predicting their ensemble behavior is challenging and requires tight coupling between experiments and modeling to uncover the underlying motor behavior. To understand how diverse kinesins attached to the same cargo coordinate their movement, we carried out microtubule gliding assays using pairwise mixtures of motors from the kinesin-1, -2, -3, -5, and -7 families engineered to have identical run lengths and surface attachments. Uniform motor densities were used and microtubule gliding speeds were measured for varying proportions of fast and slow motors. A coarse-grained computational model of gliding assays was developed and found to recapitulate the experiments. Simulations incorporated published force-dependent velocities and run lengths, along with mechanical interactions between motors bound to the same microtubule. The simulations show that the force-dependence of detachment is the key parameter that determines gliding speed in multimotor assays, while motor compliance, surface density, and stall force all play minimal roles. Simulations also provide estimates for force-dependent dissociation rates, suggesting that kinesin-1 and the mitotic motors kinesin-5 and -7 maintain microtubule association against loads, whereas kinesin-2 and -3 readily detach. This work uncovers unexpected motor behavior in multimotor ensembles and clarifies functional differences between kinesins that carry out distinct mechanical tasks in cells.",0,119

The results obtained in the present study show good agreement with the available experimental values. Importantly, and contrary to previous theoretical studies, the excitation energy calculated for the important n-π(∗) state agrees well with the experimental value. A recent study by Pratt and co-workers concluded that significant mixing of π-π(∗) and n-π(∗) states leads to major change in the magnitude and direction of the dipole moment of the upper state vibrational level in the 0,0 + 280 cm(-1) band in the S1←S0 transition when compared to that of the zero-point level of the S1 state. The present study, however, shows that all the four lowest lying excited states, (1)Lb π-π(∗), (1)La π-π(∗), n-π(∗), and π-σ(∗), cross each other in one way or another, and hence, significant state mixing between them is likely. The upper state vibrational level in the 0,0 + 280 cm(-1) band in the S1←S0 transition benefits from this four-state mixing and this can explain the change in magnitude and direction of the dipole moment of the S1 excited vibrational level. This multistate mixing, and especially the involvement of π-σ(∗) state in mixing, could also provide a route for hydrogen atom detachment reactions.

Vehicle- and MEHP-treated guinea pigs were sacrificed at the interval of 3, 6, and 9 h, and the testicular tissues were processed for histopathological studies. Distinct histopathological changes were recognized in testes. Detachment and displacement of spermatogenic cells, thin seminiferous epithelia, vacuolization of Sertoli cells were prominent at 6 h after MEHP treatment. The lumina of the efferent ductules were frequently occupied with sloughed seminiferous epithelia from 6 to 9 h after MEHP treatment. Apoptotic spermatogenic cells appeared at 3 h in the control group.

Adsorption of EC is characterized by a decrease of 2.1 eV in work function at monolayer coverage. Flipped adsorption geometry on average (ethyl facing the surface) is found in the second layer with a 0.3 eV increase in the work function. On ruthenium substrates the orientation of EC molecules could be controlled chlorine down or up by varying the oxygen coverage, as indicated by work function change measurements. DeltaP-TPD from clean Ru(001) surface reveals a complete dissociation of the EC molecules on the clean Ru(001) surface at coverages up to 0.1 +/- 0.05 ML. At higher coverage it leads to two distinct TPD peaks: at T =175 and 120-130 K, for the monolayer and multilayer coverage, respectively. Compression of preadsorbed 0.3 ML EC molecules into small islands on the surface occurs when ASW layers at coverage in the range 0.5-6 bilayers (BL) are adsorbed on top of the EC covered surface, associated with a shift in peak desorption from 190 K down to 125 K. A Caging process of EC molecules within the layers of ASW takes place by adsorbing more than 6 BL until a fully caged system has developed above 20 ASW BL. A reversed TPD peak shift of the trapped EC molecules occurs from its compressed phase at 125 K up to 165 K, the onset for ASW transition to crystalline ice and desorption. The detachment process leads to partial flipping over the geometry of the EC at the second layer, as determined by DeltaPhi measurement. The distance of the lifted and caged EC molecules from the Ru surface has been determined to reside 1.0 +/- 0.2 nm above the solid surface, based on the thermal dissociation and hydrogen uptake measurements of sandwiched EC molecules between a variable thickness ASW film and a fixed 10 BL layer, on top of clean Ru(001). We conclude that the caged EC molecules are trapped in a micelle-like geometry with the ethyl groups pointing inward. This conclusion is based on photodecomposition studies of the caged EC molecules at 193 nm, as a function of EC initial coverage.",0,126

We have proposed the use of alternative methodologies for conservation and formulated innovative cleaning nanostructured systems to remove previously applied polymer films and grime from painted surfaces. In particular, a novel ""micellar system"" composed of water, SDS, 1-pentanol, ethyl acetate and propylene carbonate was recently formulated and successfully used to remove acrylic and vinyl/acrylic copolymers from Mesoamerican wall paintings in the archeological site of Cholula, Mexico. This contribution reports on the mechanism of the interaction process that takes place between the nanostructured fluid and the polymer coating at the nanoscale. The structural properties of the ""micellar solution"" and of the polymer film are investigated before, during and after the interaction process using several surface and solution techniques. Rather than a classical detergency mechanism, we demonstrate that micelles act as solvent containers and interact with the polymer film leading to its swelling and detachment from the surface and to its segregation in a liquid droplet, which phase-separates from the aqueous bulk. After the removal process the micelles become smaller in size and undergo a structural re-arrangement due to the depletion of the organic solvents. These findings can be framed in an interaction mechanism which describes the removal process, opening up new perspectives in the design and formulation of new cleaning systems specifically tailored for intervention on particular conservation issues.",0,129

KCNQ3 is widely thought to co-assemble with several other KCNQ subtypes, whereas KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 do not. However, the existence of other subunit assemblies is not well studied. To systematically explore the heteromeric assembly of KCNQ channels in individual living cells, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged KCNQ subunits expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in which excitation light only penetrates several hundred nanometers into the cell, thus isolating membrane events. We found significant FRET between homomeric subunits as expected from their functional expression in heterologous expression systems. Also as expected from previous work, robust FRET was observed between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. KCNQ3 and KCNQ4 also showed substantial FRET as did KCNQ4 and KCNQ5.

Representatives of P-I and P-III classes of SVMPs similarly hydrolyze extracellular matrix proteins or coagulation factors while only P-III SVMPs induce significant hemorrhage in experimental models. In this work, the effects of P-I and P-III SVMPs on plasma proteins and cultures of muscle and endothelial cells were compared in order to enlighten the mechanisms involved in venom-induced hemorrhage. To reach this comparison, BnP1 was isolated from B. neuwiedi venom and used as a weakly hemorrhagic P-I SVMPs and jararhagin was used as a model of potently hemorrhagic P-III SVMP. BnP1 was isolated by size exclusion and anion-exchange chromatographies, showing apparent molecular mass of approximately 24kDa and sequence similarity with other members of SVMPs, which allowed its classification as a group P-I SVMP. The comparison of local effects induced by SVMPs showed that BnP1 was devoid of significant myotoxic and hemorrhagic activities and jararhagin presented only hemorrhagic activity. BnP1 and jararhagin were able to hydrolyze fibrinogen and fibrin, although the latter displayed higher activity in both systems. Using HUVEC primary cultures, we observed that BnP1 induced cell detachment and a decrease in the number of viable endothelial cells in levels comparable to those observed by treatment with jararhagin. Moreover, both BnP1 and jararhagin induced apoptosis in HUVECs while only a small increase in LDH supernatant levels was observed after treatment with jararhagin, suggesting that the major mechanism involved in endothelial cell death is apoptosis. Jararhagin and BnP1 induced little effects on C2C12 muscle cell cultures, characterized by a partial detachment 24h after treatment and a mild necrotic effect as evidenced by a small increase in the supernatants LDH levels.

In this work, physical chemistry parameters which could be involved in these processes were explored. To model the confined environment of proteins within the ER, the dynamic behavior of gamma-gliadins inserted inside lyotropic lamellar phases was studied using FRAP experiments. The evolution of the diffusion coefficient as a function of the lamellar periodicity enabled to propose the hypothesis of an interaction between gamma-gliadins and membranes. This interaction was further studied with the help of phospholipid Langmuir monolayers. gamma- and omega-gliadins were injected under DMPC and DMPG monolayers and the two-dimensional (2D) systems were studied by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), polarization modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), and surface tension measurements. Results showed that both gliadins adsorbed under phospholipid monolayers, considered as biological membrane models, and formed micrometer-sized domains at equilibrium. However, their thicknesses, probed by reflectance measurements, were different: omega-gliadins aggregates displayed a constant thickness, consistent with a monolayer, while the thickness of gamma-gliadins aggregates increased with the quantity of protein injected. These different behaviors could find some explanations in the difference of aminoacid sequence distribution: an alternate repeated - unrepeated domain within gamma-gliadin sequence, while one unique repeated domain was present within omega-gliadin sequence. All these findings enabled to propose a model of gliadins self-assembly via a membrane interface and to highlight the predominant role of wheat prolamin repeated domain in the membrane interaction. In the biological context, these results would mean that the repeated domain could be considered as an anchor for the interaction with the ER membrane and a nucleus point for the formation and growth of protein bodies within endosperm cells.

In this study, we systematically studied electroporation of tumor and blood cells in the context of selective purging and analysis of CTCs, using M109 and mouse blood cells as models. Electroporation is a simple and effective method for disruption of the cell membrane by applying an external electric field. We applied a microfluidic flow-through electroporation to process cells with various electroporation durations and field intensities. With duration of 100-300 ms, we found that the thresholds for electroporation-induced lysis started at 300-400 V cm(-1) for M109, 400-500 V cm(-1) for white blood cells and 1100-1200 V cm(-1) for red blood cells. Due to the substantial difference, we demonstrated the selective electroporation of tumor cells among blood cells and the scale-up of the flow-through electroporation devices for processing samples of millilitre volumes. Using Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and fluorescence microscopy tools, we observed the dramatic increase in the size of the nucleus of a tumor cell in response to the applied field.

The velocity component included contributions from shortening of both series elastic component (SEC) and contractile component (CC) because force output was not constant. Early in relaxation force-velocity relationships were linear but became progressively more curved as relaxation progressed. Force-velocity curves late in relaxation had the same curvature as those for the CC in fully activated muscles but V(max) was reduced to approximately 50% of the value in fully activated muscles. These results were the same for slow- and fast-twitch muscles and for relaxation following maximal tetani and brief, sub-maximal tetani. The measured series elastic compliance was used to partition shortening velocity between SEC and CC. The curvature of the CC force-velocity relationship was constant during relaxation. The SEC accounted for most of the shortening and work output during relaxation and its power output during relaxation exceeded the maximum CC power output. It is proposed that unloading the CC, without any change in its overall length, accelerated cross-bridge detachment when shortening was applied during relaxation.",0,137

Clinically available alternatives such as gas and silicone oil have side effects such as inflammation, secondary glaucoma, cataract, and a need for head posturing. In this study, a hydrogel of cross-linked sodium hyaluronic acid (Healaflow(®)) is evaluated for use as a novel vitreous substitute.METHODSA combined 25-20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with posterior vitreous detachment was performed in the right eye of twelve pigmented rabbits, with subsequent injection of approximately 1 ml Healaflow(®). Clinical evaluation, measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), and full-field ERG were performed postoperatively. The rabbits were sacrificed at different time-points between 42 and 105 days. After enucleation, the eyes were examined macroscopically, photographed, and prepared for histological examination with routine microscopy and immunohistochemistry.RESULTSHealaflow(®) was successfully used with standard surgical procedures and remained translucent but did lose most of its viscosity during the postoperative period. One rabbit was lost due to unrelated causes. In two eyes iatrogenic partial retinal detachments were seen, and in two eyes significant cataract developed due to intra-operative complications. ERG-recordings revealed no toxic effect on rod or cone function. Routine microscopy and immunohistochemistry demonstrated normal morphology with some Müller cell activation (up-regulation of glial acidic fibrillary protein, GFAP) compared to unoperated eyes and no significant DNA-fragmentation (TUNEL-assay).CONCLUSIONSHealaflow® did not affect retinal morphology or function negatively during long-term use as a vitreous substitute, making it highly interesting in this setting. An estimated retention time of a few weeks suggests potential for use as a short-term tamponade. Future work will include an increased ratio of cross-linking to prolong the structural integrity of the gel.",0,138

In doing so we provide a model to reference for involving people with dementia in research and knowledge production, while simultaneously strengthening the evidence base for the residency as a method for participatory research. People with dementia participated in two residencies to co-produce a touring exhibition and educational resource as part of a research dissemination project. We found that by privileging place a more equitable, productive, healthier, and respectful way of involving people with dementia as collaborators in research dissemination could be realised.

140,"Baruch, M. C., et al. (2011"," ""Pulse Decomposition Analysis of the digital arterial pulse during hemorrhage simulation."" Nonlinear biomedical physics 5(1","BACKGROUNDMarkers of temporal changes in central blood volume are required to non-invasively detect hemorrhage and the onset of hemorrhagic shock. Recent work suggests that pulse pressure may be such a marker. A new approach to tracking blood pressure, and pulse pressure specifically is presented that is based on a new form of pulse pressure wave analysis called Pulse Decomposition Analysis (PDA). The premise of the PDA model is that the peripheral arterial pressure pulse is a superposition of five individual component pressure pulses, the first of which is due to the left ventricular ejection from the heart while the remaining component pressure pulses are reflections and re-reflections that originate from only two reflection sites within the central arteries. The hypothesis examined here is that the PDA parameter T13, the timing delay between the first and third component pulses, correlates with pulse pressure.T13 was monitored along with blood pressure, as determined by an automatic cuff and another continuous blood pressure monitor, during the course of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) sessions involving four stages, -15 mmHg, -30 mmHg, -45 mmHg, and -60 mmHg, in fifteen subjects (average age: 24.4 years, SD: 3.0 years; average height: 168.6 cm, SD: 8.0 cm; average weight: 64.0 kg, SD: 9.1 kg).RESULTSStatistically significant correlations between T13 and pulse pressure as well as the ability of T13 to resolve the effects of different LBNP stages were established. Experimental T13 values were compared with predictions of the PDA model. These interventions resulted in pulse pressure changes of up to 7.8 mmHg (SE = 3.49 mmHg) as determined by the automatic cuff. Corresponding changes in T13 were a shortening by -72 milliseconds (SE = 4.17 milliseconds). In contrast to the other two methodologies, T13 was able to resolve the effects of the two least negative pressure stages with significance set at p < 0.01.CONCLUSIONSThe agreement of observations and measurements provides a preliminary validation of the PDA model regarding the origin of the arterial pressure pulse reflections. The proposed physical picture of the PDA model is attractive because it identifies the contributions of distinct reflecting arterial tree components to the peripheral pressure pulse envelope. Since the importance of arterial pressure reflections to cardiovascular health is well known, the PDA pulse analysis could provide, beyond the tracking of blood pressure, an assessment tool of those reflections as well as the health of the sites that give rise to them.",0,140

Ten students were recruited and consented but only eight completed the project. The SHOWeD method was used to assist the students to formally reflect upon their photographs. Data analysis was conducted using content analysis to identify themes presented the students' reflections. The themes were staying healthy, stress dealing with anger/frustration, maintaining friendships and communication, recognizing bullying, and planning for the future. Reflections aided students to provide rich details about how the school environment influences their mental and emotional health. The use of Photovoice is a reasonable method for at-risk youth to explore and describe their environment.

It is an important story to tell primarily because it touches on a largely unexplored dimension of teacher reflection. While the large majority of the literature has focused on how to prepare White preservice teachers to teach in a culturally and racially complex world, little qualitative attention has been given to the preparation of nonwhite students. While there are a few select and important articles that touch on some of the challenges African American students face in predominately White teacher education programs, including covert and overt racism, none focus on how teacher reflection might reproduce these dynamics. Thus what the literature on teacher reflection often suggests is that it is a racially neutral practice. In this essay, however, I suggests otherwise, by providing an intimate and critical look at my process of learning to be a reflective practitioner.

Indeed, the power of today’s e-media imagery has, arguably, a more ubiquitous influence on such decisions than was in the case for previous generations. However, both traditional print and more contemporary media influencers remain important and, therefore, gaining an understanding of their role in the representation of gendered work, both historically and in a modern context, is of considerable value. Working in the sky, whether as a pilot or member of the cabin crew, continues to hold a fascination and attraction for potential entrants that far exceeds the technical demands or financial rewards of the reality of such work. Perceived as ‘glamorous’ work since the early days of commercial flight in the 1930s, this tag has largely remained, despite major changes to the business and workplace environment in the intervening years. Commercial aviation is an area of work that has inspired a genre of influential romantic literature and numerous ‘real-life’ recollections alongside serious academic analysis. This paper charts the representation of, in particular, female flight attendant work from its ‘golden era’ through to the present context where the influence of the lowcost airline model has radically impacted upon the working environment within the sector. The discussion focuses on the broad ‘genre’ of airline-related employment literature, drawing on romantic, comic and biographical accounts alongside sources that address this theme from academic/research perspectives, in order to ask whether contemporary representation is any more a true reflection of this work than that during previous generations. In undertaking this analysis, this paper draws upon the role and career representation literature, particularly with respect to embodied and gendered work.

Analytical chemistry 79(20","Total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) analysis is a well-established method to monitor lowest level contamination on semiconductor surfaces. Even light elements on a wafer surface can be excited effectively when using high-flux synchrotron radiation in the soft X-ray range. To meet current industrial requirements in nondestructive semiconductor analysis, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) operates dedicated instrumentation for analyzing light element contamination on wafer pieces as well as on 200- and 300-mm silicon wafer surfaces. This instrumentation is also suited for grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence analysis and conventional energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis of buried and surface nanolayered structures, respectively. The most prominent features are a high-vacuum load-lock combined with an equipment front end module and a UHV irradiation chamber with an electrostatic chuck mounted on an eight-axis manipulator. Here, the entire surface of a 200- or a 300-mm wafer can be scanned by monochromatized radiation provided by the plane grating monochromator beamline for undulator radiation in the PTB laboratory at the electron storage ring BESSY II. This beamline provides high spectral purity and high photon flux in the range of 0.078-1.86 keV. In addition, absolutely calibrated photodiodes and Si(Li) detectors are used to monitor the exciting radiant power respectively the fluorescence radiation. Furthermore, the footprint of the excitation radiation at the wafer surface is well-known due to beam profile recordings by a CCD during special operation conditions at BESSY II that allow for drastically reduced electron beam currents. Thus, all the requirements of completely reference-free quantitation of TXRF analysis are fulfilled and are to be presented in the present work. The perspectives to arrange for reference-free quantitation using X-ray tube-based, table-top TXRF analysis are also addressed.",0,144

A 116(23","Using density functional theory and hybrid B3LYP exchange-correlation energy functional we have studied the structure, stability, and spectroscopic properties of singly and doubly charged anions composed of simple metal atoms (Na, Mg, Al) decorated with halogens such as Cl and pseudohalogens such as CN. Since pseudohalogens mimic the chemistry of halogen atoms, our objective is to see if pseudohalogens can also form superhalogens much as halogens do and if the critical size for a doubly charged anion depends upon the ligand. The electron affinities of MCl(n) (M = Na, Mg, Al) exceed the value of Cl for n ≥ (k + 1), where k is the normal valence of the metal atom. However, for M(CN)(n) complexes this is only true when n = k + 1. In addition, while the electron affinities and vertical detachment energies of MCl(n) complexes are close to each other, they are markedly different when Cl is replaced by pseudohalogen, CN. The origin of these anomalous results is found to be due to the large binding energy of cyanogen, (NCCN) molecule. Because of the tendency of CN molecules to dimerize, the ground state geometries of the neutral and anionic M(CN)(n) complexes are very different when their number exceed the normal valence of the metal atom. While our calculations support the conclusion of Skurski and co-workers that pseudohalogens can form the building blocks of superhalogens, we show that there is a limitation on the number of CN moieties where this is true. Equally important, we find large differences between the ground state geometries of the neutral and anionic M(CN)(n) complexes for n ≥ (k + 2) which could play an important role in interpreting future experimental data on M(CN)(n) complexes. This is because the electron affinity defined as the energy difference between the ground states of the anion and neutral can be very different from the adiabatic detachment energy defined as the energy difference between the ground state of the anion and its structurally similar neutral isomer.",0,147

That feeling of strangeness the adolescent experiences on waking up in a dream, with a new feeling and desire of the love object. The ardent desire of being like a grown-up, and the motions toward their parents, influence decisions for which the young are not prepared, given their cradled education and the unsatisfactory answers to their infant sexual investigation. Lacan notes that the sexual relationship does not exist. Freud rates love as being narcissistic and childish.

The advantages, particularly as to the quality and reliability of clinical diagnoses, outweigh the disadvantages with temptations to mechanistic and reductionistic applications of criteria and incomplete nosological evaluation. Comprehensive clinical evaluation, however, should work at two separate levels: one, the initial, syndromatical diagnostic level, followed by the other, the nosological level, with evaluation of factors possibly influencing course and outcome of the psychiatric disorders. Only when both the syndromatical diagnosis and nosological factors are taken into consideration, is it possible to get a full understanding of the disorder necessary for optimal treatment.

Journal of molecular biology 393(5","In the past decade, single-molecule force spectroscopy has provided new insights into the key interactions stabilizing folded proteins. A few recent studies probing the effects of ligand binding on mechanical protein stability have come to quite different conclusions. While some proteins seem to be stabilized considerably by a bound ligand, others appear to be unaffected. Since force acts as a vector in space, it is conceivable that mechanical stabilization by ligand binding is dependent on the direction of force application. In this study, we vary the direction of the force to investigate the effect of ligand binding on the stability of maltose binding protein (MBP). MBP consists of two lobes connected by a hinge region that move from an open to a closed conformation when the ligand maltose binds. Previous mechanical experiments, where load was applied to the N and C termini, have demonstrated that MBP is built up of four building blocks (unfoldons) that sequentially detach from the folded structure. In this study, we design the pulling direction so that force application moves the two MBP lobes apart along the hinge axis. Mechanical unfolding in this geometry proceeds via an intermediate state whose boundaries coincide with previously reported MBP unfoldons. We find that in contrast to N-C-terminal pulling experiments, the mechanical stability of MBP is increased by ligand binding when load is applied to the two lobes and force breaks the protein-ligand interactions directly. Contour length measurements indicate that MBP is forced into an open conformation before unfolding even if ligand is bound. Using mutagenesis experiments, we demonstrate that the mechanical stabilization effect is due to only a few key interactions of the protein with its ligand. This work illustrates how varying the direction of the applied force allows revealing important details about the ligand binding mechanics of a large protein.",0,152

This study aimed to examine the current status of and factors associated with client's satisfaction with family planning services in Tanzania, which has a high unmet need for family planning. METHODS: The study used data from the Tanzania Service Provision Assessment survey of 2014-2015. A facility was classified as having high service readiness for FP if it scored at least 67.7% on a composite score based on three domains (staff training and guidelines, basic diagnostic equipment, and basic medicines), following criteria developed by the World Health Organization. The exit interview questionnaire was used to collect information from women about their level of satisfaction, whether ""very satisfied,"" ""more or less satisfied,"" or not satisfied with the services received. The response was dichotomized into ""Yes"" if the woman reported being very satisfied with services received otherwise coded as ""No"". Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the client satisfaction and covariate variables; service readiness, facility type, managing authority, location, management meetings, supervision, provider's sex, and working experience, clients' age and education. All analyses were weighted to correct for non-response, disproportionate and complex sampling by using the ""SVY"" command in Stata 14. RESULTS: Out of the 1188 facilities included in the survey, 427 (35.9%) provided family planning services. A total of 1746 women participated in observations and exit interviews. Few (22%) facilities had a high readiness to provide family planning services. While most facilities had the recommended equipment available, only 42% stocked contraceptives (e.g. oral pills, injectable contraceptives and/or condoms). Further, trained staff and clinical guidelines were present in only 30% of services. Nevertheless, the majority (91%) of clients reported that they were satisfied with services. In the multivariate analysis, a high service readiness score [AOR = 2.5, 95% CI; 1.1-6.0], receiving services from private facilities [AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.1-5.0], and being in the age group 20 to 29 years [AOR = 0.3, 95% CI; 0.1-0.7] were all significantly associated with clients' satisfaction with family planning services. CONCLUSION: There is a high level of client satisfaction with family planning services in Tanzania.

This disease is associated with antisocial behavior, impulse control disorder and cognitive and personality impairment, which are often the earliest manifestations of the bvFTD. One of the antisocial behaviors possibly associated with this neurodegenerative disease is pathological stealing. This case report is about a 50-year-old Italian man who had a regular life until 2010. In 2010 and 2011, some critical events occurred: he lost his job, his father-in-law, to whom he was particularly close, died, and his wife had a serious illness. He began to show symptoms of depression, a significant weight loss, apathy, poor self-care, and lack of interest in the activities of his family. He became disengaged from his prior activities, emotionally detached from his family and developed compulsive hoarding. Moreover, he had uninhibited behaviors, a memory retrieval deficit, executive dysfunctions and impulsive behaviors. In January 2012, the subject began stealing objects, particularly components of computer, without premeditation or concern for resulting legal actions. He was then diagnosed affected by bvFTD. He was charged with theft and attempted theft and the Court asked for a psychiatric evaluation, in order to analyze the effect of the neurodegenerative disease on his behavior. To answer to the Court, the Authors analyzed his history of life and made a mental examination. The subject was considered mentally insane at the time of his crimes. This is an example of the practical application in judicial cases of the latest knowledge and evidence in the literature about the frontotemporal dementia, a disease associated with antisocial behaviors that could create tensions with the criminal law. The focus of the paper is to explain how the behavioral symptoms of bvFTD can have legal implications and how to deal with legal aspects of the behaviors induced by a neuro-psychiatric condition, such as bvFTD.

However, scattering of shock waves produced by cavity collapse is shown to exhibit a significant effect. To demonstrate this, multibubble sonoluminescence (MBSL) and electrochemical erosion measurements are employed. These measurements show an enhancement, due to the reflection by the solid/liquid boundary at the electrode support, of pressure pulses emitted when cavitation bubbles collapse. To first order, this effect can be accounted for by a correction factor. However, this factor requires accurate knowledge of the acoustic impedance of the interface and the electrolyte media. These are measured for two commonly employed substrates (soda glass and epoxy resin, specifically Epofix). A scattering model is developed which is able to predict the acoustic pressure as a function of position over a disk-like electrode substrate. The effects of shock wave reflection and materials employed in the electrode construction are used to clarify the interpretation of the results obtained from different sonoelectrochemical experiments. Given the widespread experimentation involving the insertion of electrodes (or other sensors) into ultrasonic fields, this work represents a significant development to aid the interpretation of the results obtained.",0,157

Acta physiologica (Oxford, England","AIMTo explore whether high-level endurance training in early age has an influence on the arterial wall properties in young women.METHODSForty-seven athletes (ATH) and 52 controls (CTR), all 17-25 years of age, were further divided into runners (RUN), whole-body endurance athletes (WBA), sedentary controls (SC) and normally active controls (AC). Two-dimensional ultrasound scanning of the carotid arteries was conducted to determine local common carotid artery (CCA) geometry and wall distensibility. Pulse waves were recorded with a tonometer to determine regional pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse pressure waveform.RESULTSCarotid-radial PWV was lower in WBA than in RUN (P < .05), indicating higher arterial distensibility along the arm. Mean arterial pressure was lower in ATH than in CTR and in RUN than in WBA (P < .05). Synthesized aortic augmentation index (AI@75) was lower among ATH than among CTR (-12.8 ± 1.6 vs -2.6 ± 1.2%, P < .001) and in WBA than in RUN (-16.4 ± 2.5 vs -10.7 ± 2.0%, P < .05), suggesting a diminished return of reflection waves to the aorta during systole. Carotid-femoral PWV and intima-media thickness (IMT), lumen diameter and radial distensibility of the CCA were similar in ATH and CTR.CONCLUSIONElastic artery distensibility and carotid artery IMT are not different in young women with extensive endurance training over several years and in those with sedentary lifestyle. On the other hand, our data suggest that long-term endurance training is associated with potentially favourable peripheral artery adaptation, especially in sports where upper body work is added. This adaptation, if persisting later in life, could contribute to lower cardiovascular risk.",0,158

Biokhimiia 77(10","Early studies on chemical synthesis of biological molecules can be seen to progress to preparation and biological evaluation of phosphonates as analogues of biological phosphates, with emphasis on their isosteric and isopolar character. Work with such mimics progressed into structural studies with a range of nucleotide-utilising enzymes. The arrival of metal fluorides as analogues of the phosphoryl group, PO(3)(-), for transition state (TS) analysis of enzyme reactions stimulated the symbiotic deployment of (19)F NMR and protein crystallography. Characteristics of enzyme transition state analogues are reviewed for a range of reactions. From the available MF(x) species, trifluoroberyllate gives tetrahedral mimics of ground states (GS) in which phosphate is linked to carboxylate and phosphate oxyanions. Tetrafluoroaluminate is widely employed as a TS mimic, but it necessarily imposes octahedral geometry on the assembled complexes, whereas phosphoryl transfer involves trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) geometry. Trifluoromagnesate (MgF(3)(-)) provides the near-ideal solution, delivering tbp geometry and correct anionic charge. Some of the forty reported tbp structures assigned as having AlF(3)(0) cores have been redefined as trifluoromagnesate complexes. Transition state analogues for a range of kinases, mutases, and phosphatases provide a detailed description of mechanism for phosphoryl group transfer, supporting the concept of charge balance in their TS and of concerted-associative pathways for biocatalysis. Above all, superposition of GS and TS structures reveals that in associative phosphoryl transfer, the phosphorus atom migrates through a triangle of three, near-stationary, equatorial oxygens. The extension of these studies to near attack conformers further illuminates enzyme catalysis of phosphoryl transfer.",0,159

Veterinary parasitology 189(2-4","Horseflies (Diptera: Tabanidae) can cause severe problems for humans and livestock because of the continuous annoyance performed and the diseases vectored by the haematophagous females. Therefore, effective horsefly traps are in large demand, especially for stock-breeders. To catch horseflies, several kinds of traps have been developed, many of them attracting these insects visually with the aid of a black ball. The recently discovered positive polarotaxis (attraction to horizontally polarized light) in several horsefly species can be used to design traps that capture female and male horseflies. The aim of this work is to present the concept of such a trap based on two novel principles: (1) the visual target of the trap is a horizontal solar panel (photovoltaics) attracting polarotactic horseflies by means of the highly and horizontally polarized light reflected from the photovoltaic surface. (2) The horseflies trying to touch or land on the photovoltaic trap surface are perished by the mechanical hit of a wire rotated quickly with an electromotor supplied by the photovoltaics-produced electricity. Thus, the photovoltaics is bifunctional: its horizontally polarized reflected light signal attracts water-seeking, polarotactic horseflies, and it produces the electricity necessary to rotate the wire. We describe here the concept and design of this new horsefly trap, the effectiveness of which was demonstrated in field experiments. The advantages and disadvantages of the trap are discussed. Using imaging polarimetry, we measured the reflection-polarization characteristics of the photovoltaic trap surface demonstrating the optical reason for the polarotactic attractiveness to horseflies.",0,160

Threat scenarios confirmed these relationships in people, with results substantially replicated in 4 additional scenario studies. Subsequent human studies involve computer games measuring fear as flight from threat stimuli and anxiety as alternation between two threats. Stabilometric studies have shown reduction in sway (freezing) to inescapable (e.g. with gun pointed at subject) threatening photographs; but enhanced lateral sway (flight attempts) to escapable threats; (gun pointed away from subject). Relationships between threat ambiguity, risk assessment, and anxiety have been validated by identification of videos of facial expressions to ambiguous threats, as anxiety; and systematic biases toward threat stimuli by anxious individuals. Enhanced rumination, interpretable as unsuccessful risk assessment, is a dynamic component of both anxiety and depression, particularly in women. While there is less experimental work on defensive threat/attack, a transdiagnostic 'Fear of Harm' phenotype of aggression associated with fear suggests that this is a component of pathological as well as normal human defensive behavior.

The diagnosis is usually based on clinical manifestation and chest X-ray. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible role of chest ultrasound in the diagnosis of the RDS.MATERIAL/METHODSUltrasound examination was performed in 131 consecutive newborns admitted to the NICU in their first day of life with symptoms of respiratory failure. The method of ultrasound examination of the chest is based on the ""mirror reflection"" phenomenon arising on the pulmonary-diaphragmatic border.RESULTSRetrohepatic or retrosplenic hyperechogenicity was shown in 109 of the 131 examined newborns and the diagnosis was confirmed by X-ray in 101 cases. RDS was diagnosed in no patient without retrohepatic or retrosplenic hyperechogenicity. In eight patients with positive ultrasound images unconfirmed by chest X-ray, congenital pneumonia (four cases) and pneumothorax (one case) were diagnosed and in three cases no pathology was found.CONCLUSIONSThe ultrasound examination is characterized by 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity in RDS. There was a strong positive correlation between ultrasound and X-ray imaging in the description of RDS severity (tau = 0.835; p < 0.001). Ultrasound examination cannot replace chest X-ray in the respiratory failure work-up as it overestimates the diagnosis, but it can be useful in excluding RDS as a cause of respiratory insufficiency in newborns.",0,164

Psychiatry Research 265: 1-6.","Deficits in empathy seen in schizophrenia are thought to play a major role in the social dysfunction seen in the disorder. However, little work has investigated potential determinants of empathic deficits. This study aimed to fill that gap by examining the effects of two variables on empathy - distress tolerance and metacognitive self-reflectivity. Fifty-four people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders receiving services at an urban VA or community mental health center were assessed for empathy, metacognition, and distress tolerance. Bivariate correlations and moderation methods were used to ascertain associations amongst these variables and examine interactions. Results revealed that, against hypotheses, empathy was not related at the bivariate level to either distress tolerance or metacognitive self-reflectivity. However, consistent with hypotheses, moderation analyses revealed that participants with higher self-reflectivity showed no relationship between distress tolerance and empathy, while those with lower self-reflectivity showed a relationship such that reduced ability to tolerate distress predicted reduced empathy. Taken together, results of this study suggest that lack of distress tolerance can negatively affect empathy in people with schizophrenia with lesser capacity for metacognitive self-reflection; thus, fostering self-reflectivity may help overcome that negative impact. Future work is needed investigating the impact of metacognitively-tailored interventions on empathy in this population.",0,166

Several chemical and physical methods have been identified as being effective in increasing the proportion of RUP of total CP of a feedstuff, yet there is a continuing need for developing and establishing methods which protect feed protein from ruminal degradation with acceptable expenditure of labour and other costs. The objective of this study was to identify and quantify effects of and interactions between chlorogenic acid and protein in solvent-extracted sunflower meal (SFM) as induced by alkali treatment. Response surface methodology was employed to investigate the influence of pH, reaction time and drying temperature on the resulting SFM and, subsequently, its protein value for ruminants estimated from laboratory values. For this purpose, alkali-treated SFM was subjected to a fractionation of feed CP according to the Cornell net carbohydrate and protein system as a basis for estimating RUP at different assumed ruminal passage rates (Kp ). To estimate the intestinal digestibility of the treated SFM and its RUP, a three-step enzymatic in vitro procedure was applied. Alkaline treatment of SFM increased RUP values with factors ranging from approximately 3 (Kp =.08/hr) to 12 (Kp =.02/hr). Furthermore, the intestinal digestibility of the alkali-treated SFM was enhanced by approximately 10% compared to untreated SFM. Increasing pH and reaction time led to both increasing RUP values and intestinal digestibility. In conclusion, a targeted alkaline treatment of naturally occurring compounds in feedstuffs might be a promising approach to provide high-RUP feeds for ruminants which, at the same time, have improved intestinal digestibility values.",0,167

Wave speed was calculated using PU-loop, (lnD)U-loop, QA-loop, D(2)P-loop, sum of squares and characteristic impedance methods. Results were compared to the foot-to-foot method. We found that far from the reflections almost all methods give uniform results. Close to positive reflections the methods that rely on P and Q (or U) overestimate the wave speed value, while techniques based on D (or A) and Q (or U) underestimate it. On the contrary, close to negative reflections the methods that rely on P and Q (or U) underestimate the wave speed value, while techniques based on D (or A) and Q (or U) overestimate it.

Positioning the side chains on the resulting backbone, using the above procedures, gives rise to a well-defined 5.15 A meridian reflection.",0,181

The studies with DPPG as model system revealed strong adsorption and massive incorporation of the peptide into the monolayer. Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) experiments showed that the secondary structure of the peptide is maintained upon adsorption. Specular X-ray reflectivity showed the destabilization of the condensed phase of the pure lipid monolayer and revealed a tilted orientation of the long axis of the peptide helix of about 40 degrees from the surface normal. Incorporation of the peptide was found to be pressure dependent, and at high pressure a ""squeeze-out"" was observed; however, the peptide remained localized to the interface, as suggested by infrared data. These findings were supported by optical fluorescence microscopy measurements which showed the squeeze-out of the peptide on water, but not under physiological conditions. The results suggest that dicynthaurin is able to adsorb to the phosphatidylglycerol-rich inner cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and alter membrane integrity. To identify and interact with membrane motifs that are characteristic of microbes, but which are absent in eukaryotic cells, might be an intrinsic ability of peptide antibiotics.",0,182

Patients are instructed to position themselves postoperatively to appose the intraocular bubble to the retinal break(s). We developed a novel wearable wireless positioning sensor, which provides real-time audiovisual feedback on the accuracy of positioning.METHODSEight healthy volunteers wore the wireless sensor for 3 hours while instructed to maintain their head tilted toward the 2 o'clock meridian with no audiovisual feedback. Positioning accuracy was recorded. The subjects repeated the experiment for 3 hours with the audiovisual feedback enabled.RESULTSWith no audiovisual feedback, the percentage of time greater than 10° out of position varied from 8.9% to 93.9%. With audiovisual feedback enabled, these percentages ranged from 9.4% to 65%. Three subjects showed significant improvement in their time out of position (P<0.01, Fisher's exact test). Four subjects demonstrated a nonsignificant improvement, and one subject had a significant increase in time out of position with feedback (P<0.01). When pooled, all subjects demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in degrees out of position (P<0.001, Wilcoxon test) and a statistically significant improvement in total time out of position (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONThe novel positioning sensor showed improved positioning compliance in half of the healthy volunteers during our short pilot study. Other subjects derived little benefit from the feedback. The causes for this observation are unclear. However, given the significant improvement as a group, this new technology could be beneficial to patients who struggle with postoperative positioning.",0,183

Using an exploratory, qualitative approach and informed by ‘appreciative inquiry’; semi‐structured interviews were undertaken with 26 residential care workers. The findings highlight that relationship‐based practice has not been fully understood and/or embraced in practice because of a culture of fear that has permeated the Irish residential childcare system. Using theoretical concepts associated with the sociology of fear, the paper explores their effects on practice and argues that these are amplified given the current low status of residential care workers, the impact of media reports and the influence of current discourses around professional practice in which ‘objective’ and ‘emotionally detached’ practice is viewed as synonymous with efficiency and effectiveness.

Recent studies have shown recurrent gene amplifications and overexpression of SLC12A7 in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). The potential mechanistic effect(s) of SLC12A7 amplifications in portending an aggressive behavior in ACC has not been previously studied and is investigated here using two established ACC cell lines, SW-13 and NCI-H295R.METHODSSW-13 cells, which express negligible amounts of SLC12A7, were enforced to express SLC12A7 constitutively, while RNAi gene silencing was performed in NCI-H295R cells, which have robust endogenous expression of SLC12A7. In vitro studies tested the outcomes of experimental alterations in SLC12A7 expression on malignant characteristics, including cell viability, growth, colony formation potential, motility, invasive capacity, adhesion and detachment kinetics, and cell membrane organization. Further, potential alterations in transcription regulation downstream to induced SLC12A7 overexpression was explored using targeted transcription factor expression arrays.RESULTSEnforced SLC12A7 overexpression in SW-13 cells robustly promoted motility and invasive characteristics (p < 0.05) without significantly altering cell viability, growth, or colony formation potential. SLC12A7 overexpression also significantly increased rates of cellular attachment and detachment turnover (p < 0.05), potentially propelled by increased filopodia formation and/or Ezrin interaction. In contrast, RNAi gene silencing of SLC12A7 stymied cell attachment strength as well as migration and invasion capacity in NCI-H295R cells. Transcription factor expression analysis identified multiple signally pathways potentially affected by SLC12A7 overexpression, including osmotic stress, bone morphogenetic protein, and Hippo signaling pathways.CONCLUSIONSAmplification of SLC12A7 observed in ACCs is shown here, in vitro, to exacerbate the malignant behavior of ACC cells by promoting invasive capacities, possibly mediated by alterations in multiple signaling pathways, including the osmotic stress pathway.",0,189

Biophysical journal 106(5","Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) achieves subdiffraction axial sectioning by confining fluorophore excitation to a thin layer close to the cell/substrate boundary. However, it is often unknown how thin this light sheet actually is. Particularly in objective-type TIRFM, large deviations from the exponential intensity decay expected for pure evanescence have been reported. Nonevanescent excitation light diminishes the optical sectioning effect, reduces contrast, and renders TIRFM-image quantification uncertain. To identify the sources of this unwanted fluorescence excitation in deeper sample layers, we here combine azimuthal and polar beam scanning (spinning TIRF), atomic force microscopy, and wavefront analysis of beams passing through the objective periphery. Using a variety of intracellular fluorescent labels as well as negative staining experiments to measure cell-induced scattering, we find that azimuthal beam spinning produces TIRFM images that more accurately portray the real fluorophore distribution, but these images are still hampered by far-field excitation. Furthermore, although clearly measureable, cell-induced scattering is not the dominant source of far-field excitation light in objective-type TIRF, at least for most types of weakly scattering cells. It is the microscope illumination optical path that produces a large cell- and beam-angle invariant stray excitation that is insensitive to beam scanning. This instrument-induced glare is produced far from the sample plane, inside the microscope illumination optical path. We identify stray reflections and high-numerical aperture aberrations of the TIRF objective as one important source. This work is accompanied by a companion paper (Pt.2/2).",0,191

The consequent description is authoritative and, perhaps inevitably, more detached and critical than the descriptions provided by those chapter authors who are describing their own intellectual offspring. I am inclined not to quibble; the PCL-R is described in a preliminary section, and the reason that it is treated differently from the other instruments is stated in the introduction. The editors say that their book is i n tended for correctional personnel, attorneys, judges, psychologists, and psychiatrists. I suspect that other mental health workers and probation officers will also find it useful. Violence Assessment and Intervention, a very different book. In fact, a title that refers to the assessment of violence risk is one of the few things that it shares with Otto and Douglas' book. In place of Otto and Douglas' authoritative reviews and provocative discussion is the confident opinions of two experienced people who have a series of techniques to offer. In fact, most of The Violent Person: Professional Risk Management Strategiesfor Safety and Care deals with situations including domestic violence, psychiatric emergencies, and youth violence and those that generate psychological trauma. The author is an advocate of training, specifically, 'enhanced behavioral emergency safety training'. Of the books under review, Herschel Prins has written the one that deals least directly with risk assessment but that is, by some distance, the most charming.

Most of us would be content simply to get to the fourth edition, but the author has done so with in-sight and a personal style that derives in part from his work as a probation officer and seems to embody the U.K. Probation Service's erstwhile mission to, 'advise, assist and befriend.'

Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing 24(4","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Recently, concerns have been raised about how well United Kingdom National Health Service nurses care for their patients and their level of compassion. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an established approach to helping people make positive behaviour changes, through directive, person-centred counselling within a collaborative relationship between clinician and recipient. Based on evidence that MI may influence nursing practice positively, an investigation into the feasibility of training nurses on mental health inpatient rehabilitation wards ('rehabilitation') in MI to improve patient experience was reported. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This pilot study demonstrates that training rehabilitation nurses in MI is feasible and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that a larger study to examine efficacy is warranted, including a calculation of sample size required to draw robust statistical conclusions. Nurses evaluated the training as highly relevant to their work. Patients responded well to interviews and focus groups with support from experts-by-experience; they were generally fairly satisfied with the rehabilitation ward and slight improvements in their experience were found following MI training for nurses but not at 6-month follow-up. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Rehabilitation nurses may face conflicting demands between ensuring patients with severe difficulties meet their basic needs and working with them to develop greater independence. Qualitative findings question whether nurse-patient interactions are fully valued as nursing interventions in inpatient rehabilitation. Learning MI might be a useful way of helping nurses think in detail about their interactions with patients and how to improve communications with their patients. The principles of MI should be incorporated into pre-registration training.ABSTRACTIntroduction There is limited research addressing the experiences of patients in inpatient rehabilitation (rehabilitation), who often spend long periods in hospital, and the nursing approaches utilized. Aim Based on evidence that motivational interviewing (MI) may improve nursing practice, this was a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of training rehabilitation nurses in MI and measuring patient experience. Method Nurses underwent training and supervision focusing on MI spirit. Quantitative and qualitative measures were taken pretraining, 2 months post-training and 8 months post-training. Expert-by-experience research assistants facilitated patients' participation in the study. Results This study showed that training rehabilitation nurses in MI was feasible and relevant to their work. Patients participated in interviews and focus groups with support and potential improvements that require further empirical investigation in patient experience were found following the MI training. Discussion This pilot study establishes the feasibility of a larger study addressing efficacy. Tentative qualitative findings question whether interactions between nurses and patients are valued in rehabilitation and support MI as a promising skill set for rehabilitation nurses. Implications for practice Bringing MI into inpatient rehabilitation provoked reflection on nursing practice.

The results obtained from the constrained (experimental) charge density show qualitatively similar properties to those obtained from conventional ab initio gas-phase calculations, though the quantitative differences are often substantial. The accuracy of integrated properties calculated using this procedure was established from the analysis of a wavefunction derived from simulated random-error diffraction data; that is, data obtained by adding normally distributed errors to the experimental structure factors. Analysis of this random-error wavefunction indicated that most topological properties are accurate to within approximately 5%, although the error is much larger for those properties that have a steep gradient in the region being evaluated [e.g. the value of V(2)rho(rb) at bond critical points] or are very small (e.g. the atomic dipole moment).

We reconsider detached concern here through the stories 37 intensive-care nurses told about their most memorable patients. While many described efforts to keep emotionally distant from patients, they also expressed concern for patients they felt connected to, especially those who were a first for them, who were long-term primary patients, who surprised them, or who died.

Likewise, successful gecko-inspired mimics should exhibit adhesive and frictional performance across a similarly diverse range of climates. In this work, we focus on the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the ""frictional-adhesion"" behavior of gecko-inspired adhesive pads. A surface forces apparatus was used to quantitatively measure adhesion and friction forces of a microfibrillar cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane surface against a smooth hemispherical glass disk at varying relative humidity, from 0 to 100% (including fully submerged under water). Geometrically anisotropic tilted half-cylinder microfibers yield a ""grip state"" (high adhesion and friction forces after shearing along the tilt of the fibers, Fad+ and F∥+) and a ""release state"" (low adhesion and friction after shearing against the tilt of the fibers, Fad- and F∥-). By appropriate control of the loading path, this allows for transition between strong attachment and easy detachment. Changing the preload and shear direction gives rise to differences in the effective contact area at each fiber and the microscale and nanoscale structure of the contact while changing the relative humidity results in differences in the relative contributions of van der Waals and capillary forces. In combination, both effects lead to interesting trends in the adhesion and friction forces. At up to 75% RH, the grip state adhesion force remains constant and the ratio of grip to release adhesion force does not drop below 4.0. In addition, the friction forces F∥+ and F∥- and the release state adhesion force Fad- exhibit a maximum at intermediate relative humidity between 40% and 75%.",0,197

A combination of experimental surface science and computational techniques was used: (i) temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS), reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), work function measurements (Kelvin Probe - KP), and density functional theory (DFT). Ethanol produces ethoxy (CH3CH2O) species via O-H bond breaking upon adsorption at 100 K. Ethoxy decomposition proceeds differently depending on the surface coverage. At low coverage, the decomposition of ethoxy species occurs viaβ-C-H cleavage, which leads to an oxometallacycle (OMC) intermediate. Decomposition of the OMC scissions (at 180-320 K) ultimately produces CO, H2 and surface carbon. At high coverage, along with the pathway observed in the low coverage case, a second pathway occurs around 140-200 K, which produces an acetaldehyde intermediate viaα-C-H cleavage. Further decomposition of acetaldehyde produces CH4, CO, H2 and surface carbon. However, even at high coverage this is a minor pathway, and methane selectivity is 10% at saturation coverage. The results suggests that biomass-derived oxygenates, which contain an alkyl group, react on the Rh(100) surface to produce synthesis gas (CO and H2), surface carbon and small hydrocarbons due to the high dehydrogenation and C-C bond scission activity of Rh(100).",0,198

Their occurrence can be used within crystallographic methods as minimal a priori information to drive the phasing process towards solution. Recently, brute-force methods have been developed which search for all possible positions of α-helices in the crystal cell by molecular replacement and explore all of them systematically. Knowing the α-helix orientations in advance would be a great advantage for this kind of approach. For this purpose, a fully automatic procedure to find α-helix orientations within the Patterson map has been developed. The method is based on Fourier techniques specifically addressed to the identification of helical shapes and operating on Patterson maps described in spherical coordinates. It supplies a list of candidate orientations, which are then refined by using a figure of merit based on a rotation function calculated for a template polyalanine helix oriented along the current direction. The orientation search algorithm has been optimized to work at 3 Å resolution, while the candidates are refined against all measured reflections. The procedure has been applied to a large number of protein test structures, showing an overall efficiency of 77% in finding α-helix orientations, which decreases to 48% on limiting the number of candidate solutions (to 13 on average). The information obtained may be used in many aspects in the framework of molecular-replacement phasing, as well as to constrain the generation of models in computational modelling programs.

Surgeons in their first year of independent practice were more than 9 times more likely to have high complication rates (≥2%) than surgeons in their tenth year (odds ratio [OR], 9.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-31.9). Each additional year of independent practice was associated with a 10% decrease in the risk of patients experiencing an adverse surgical event (OR, 0.90 per year of surgeon independent practice; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94).CONCLUSIONSIn this population-based study, surgical complications were significantly more likely early in surgeons' careers. Interventions may be needed in postgraduate surgical training and early independent career monitoring and mentoring processes to ensure patient safety while continually renewing the surgical workforce.",0,201

Likewise, people from low-income and minority communities, as well as immigrants from the developing world, increasingly visit physicians in North America with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or diabetes. Explanations limited to lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise are inadequate to explain the universality of what can be called a syndemic, a complex and widespread phenomenon in population health produced by multiple reinforcing conditions. Underlying the problem are complex factors-genetic, physiological, psychological, familial, social, economic, and political-coalescing to overdetermine these conditions. These interacting factors include events occurring during fetal life, maternal physiology and life context, the thrifty genotype, the nutritional transition, health impact of urbanization and immigration, social attributions and cultural perceptions of increased weight, and changes in food costs and availability resulting from globalization. Better appreciation of the complexity of causation underlying the worldwide epidemic of obesity and diabetes can refocus the work of clinicians and researchers to work at multiple levels to address prevention and treatment for these conditions among vulnerable populations.",0,203

Chemical research in toxicology 27(12","Electrophilically reactive compounds have the ability to form adducts with nucleophilic sites in DNA and proteins, constituting a risk for toxic effects. Mass spectrometric detection of adducts to N-terminal valine in hemoglobin (Hb) after detachment by modified Edman degradation procedures is one approach for in vivo monitoring of exposure to electrophilic compounds/metabolites. So far, applications have been limited to one or a few selected reactive species, such as acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide. This article presents a novel screening strategy for unknown Hb adducts to be used as a basis for an adductomic approach. The method is based on a modified Edman procedure, FIRE, specifically developed for LC-MS/MS analysis of N-terminal valine adducts in Hb detached as fluorescein thiohydantoin (FTH) derivatives. The aim is to detect and identify a priori unknown Hb adducts in human blood samples. Screening of valine adducts was performed by stepwise scanning of precursor ions in small mass increments, monitoring four fragments common for the FTH derivative of valine with different N-substitutions in the multiple-reaction mode, covering a mass range of 135 Da (m/z 503-638). Samples from six smokers and six nonsmokers were analyzed. Control experiments were performed to compare these results with known adducts and to check for artifactual formation of adducts. In all samples of smokers and nonsmokers, seven adducts were identified, of which six have previously been studied. Nineteen unknown adducts were observed, and 14 of those exhibited fragmentation patterns similar to earlier studied FTH derivatives of adducts to valine. Identification of the unknown adducts will be the focus of future work. The presented methodology is a promising screening tool using Hb adducts to indicate exposure to potentially toxic electrophilic compounds and metabolites.",0,205

Toxicology 210(2-3","Mercury produces acute renal failure in experimental animal models, but the mechanism of tubular injury has not completely been clarified. There is an increased interest in the role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of renal diseases that result primarily from injury to renal tubular epithelial cells. However, detailed studies of morpho-functional alterations induced by mercuric chloride in kidney cell lines are scarce. This work characterizes these alterations in OK cell cultures. Morphological alterations were profiled using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy, as well as mitochondrial functional assays in the cells exposed to low concentrations of HgCl2. At concentrations of 1 and 10 microM of HgCl2 there were no morphological or ultrastructural alterations, but the mitochondrial function (MTT assay) and intracellular ATP content was increased, especially at longer incubation times (6 and 9 h). At 15 microM HgCl2, both the mitochondrial activity and the endogenous ATP decreased significantly. At this concentration the OK cells rounded up, had increased number of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and detached from the cell monolayer. At 15 microM HgCl2 ultrastructural changes were characterized by dispersion of the ribosomes, dilatation of the cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, increase of number of cytoplasmic vacuoles, chromatin condensation, invaginations of the nuclear envelope, presence of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, and alterations in the size and morphology of mitochondria. At 15 microM HgCl2 apoptotic signs included membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial alterations, apoptotic bodies, and nuclear envelope rupture. Using confocal microscopy and the mitochondrial specific dye MitoTracker Red, it was possible to establish qualitative changes induced by mercury on the mitochondrial membrane potential after incubation of the cells for 6 and 9h with 15 microM HgCl2. This effect was not observed at short times (1 and 3h) with this same concentration, neither with 1 and 10 microM HgCl2 in all the studied times. Taken together, these findings indicate that low concentrations of HgCl2 induce apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial function, and the OK cell line may be considered a useful tool for the study of programmed cell death involving mercurial species and other heavy metals.",0,207

The Journal of chemical physics 137(21","We performed molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical analysis of nanoparticle pulling off from adhesive substrates. Our theoretical model of nanoparticle detachment is based on the Kramers' solution of the stochastic barrier crossing in effective one-dimensional potential well. The activation energy, ΔE, for nanoparticle detachment first decreases linearly with increasing the magnitude of the applied force, f, then it follows a power law ΔE [proportionality] (f* - f)(3/2) as magnitude of the pulling force f approaches a critical detachment force value, f*. These two different regimes in activation energy dependence on magnitude of the applied force are confirmed by analyzing nanoparticle detachment in effective one-dimensional potential obtained by weighted histogram analysis method. Simulations show that detachment of nanoparticle proceeds through neck formation such that magnitude of the activation energy is determined by balancing surface energy of the neck connecting particle to a substrate with elastic energy of nanoparticle deformation. In this regime the activation energy at zero applied force, ΔE(0), for nanoparticle with radius, R(p), shear modulus, G, surface energy, γ(p), and work of adhesion, W, is a universal function of the dimensionless parameter δ [proportionality] γ(p)W(-2/3)(GR(p))(-1/3). Simulation data are described by a scaling function ΔE(0) [proportionality] γ(p) (5/2)R(p)(1/2)G(-3/2)δ(-3.75).

Measuring predictability can provide information of the signal strength of the deterministic component of the time series in relation to the whole time series acquired. This relationship can provide information about coherent reflections in material grains with respect to the rest of incoherent noises that typically appear in non-destructive testing using ultrasonics. This is a non-parametric technique commonly used in chaos theory that does not require making any kind of assumptions about attenuation profiles. In highly scattering media (low SNR), it has been shown theoretically that the degree of predictability allows material characterization. The experimental results obtained in this work with 32 cement probes of 4 different porosities demonstrate the ability of this technique to do classification. It has also been shown that, in this particular application, the measurement of predictability can be used as an indicator of the percentages of porosity of the test samples with great accuracy.",0,209

Ukrainian physicians who work in OST programs frequently reference desire (желание) as the most significant factor in determining the success or failure of treatment. They refer to a desire to be treated, desire to get better, desire to live. The moralized imperative to possess this desire to get better is, in many ways, a reflection of how addiction and the addicted psyche is constructed and understood in the Ukrainian context.

The purpose of the present work is to delve more deeply into the nature of the interactions which give rise to the spontelectric effect in films of nitrous oxide (N2O), by observing the variation of the spontaneous field as the N2O molecules are physically removed from one another by dilution in Xe. Data, obtained using the ASTRID storage ring, are presented for films diluted by factors ξ = Xe/N2O of 0.9 to 67, at deposition temperatures of 38 K, 44 K and 48 K, where films are laid down by deposition from a gas mixture. Results show that the spontelectric field decreases as ξ increases and that at ξ = 67 for 44 K deposition, the spontelectric effect is absent. Reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) data are also reported, providing insight into the structure of Xe/N2O films and specifically showing that N2O remains dispersed in the Xe/N2O films prepared here. A simplified theoretical model is developed which illustrates that electric fields can be understood in terms of dilution-dependent dipole orientation. This model is used to reproduce experimental data up to an average molecular separation, s, of ≥1.25 nm apart, ∼4 times that associated with pure solid N2O. The disappearance of the spontelectric effect at larger average distances of separation, between s = 1.25 nm and s = 1.75 nm, is a phenomenon which cannot be described by any existing model but which shows that dipole-dipole interactions are an essential ingredient for the creation of the spontelectric state.",0,213

After treatment, cells became rounded and detached from the culture dish. alpha(v)-Integrins and focal-contact proteins were observed at adhesion sites in focal structures by immunocytochemistry. After treatment, however, cell rounding was accompanied by disorganization of the actin filaments and redistribution of alpha(v)-integrins and most of the focal proteins studied, except vinculin and tensin.

Some of the most important factors that need to be known are tread characteristics and pressure distribution in the tire-ground contact patch. In this work, a test bench has been used to adequately determine the aforementioned factors. The measurement principle of the test bench is the frustration of total internal reflection (FTIR) of light. It makes use of a laterally illuminated glass on which the tire leans. An interposed plastic interface between them causes the reflection of light. Finally, a video camera captures the bright image formed through the glass. The brightness level in each pixel of the image is related to existing normal pressure. A study of the parameters that affect the test bench calibration such as type of interface material used, diffuse light, hysteresis, creep and transverse light absorption is performed.

These harvesters work in intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards. A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters. The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system. The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective field capacity or field efficiency.

Insight into the illness suggests that it represents a spectrum of disorders, and a categorical delineation of 'psychotic' and 'nonpsychotic' variants cannot be supported. We are beginning to understand more about the neurocognitive aspects of body dysmorphic disorder, but more research is required to assess which deficits/aberrations (if any) are exclusive to body dysmorphic disorder as an entity, and which are a reflection of broader phenomenological manifestations. Finally, the mainstay of treatment for body dysmorphic disorder remains behaviour/cognitive behaviour therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitors; much more work is required to identify effective interventions for those patients who fail to respond to these treatment modalities.",0,217

Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology 28(4","BACKGROUND/AIMSIt has been shown that MDCK cells, a cell line derived from canine renal tubules, develop cell domes due to fluid pumped under cell monolayer and focal detachment from the adhesion surface. In vitro studies have shown that primary cilia of kidney tubular epithelial cells act as mechanosensors, increasing intracellular calcium within seconds upon changes in fluid shear stress (SS) on cell membrane. We then studied the effect of prolonged SS exposure on cell dome formation in confluent MDCK cell monolayers.METHODSA parallel plate flow chamber was used to apply laminar SS at 2 dynes/cm(2) to confluent cell monolayers for 6 hours. Control MDCK cell monolayers were maintained in static condition. The effects of Ca(2+) blockade and cell deciliation on SS exposure were also investigated.RESULTSSeven days after reaching confluence, static cultures developed liquid filled domes, elevating from culture plate. Exposure to SS induced almost complete disappearance of cell domes (0.4±0.8 vs. 11.4±2.8 domes/mm(2), p < 0.01, n=14). SS induced dome disappearance took place within minutes to hours, as shown by time-lapse videomicroscopy. Exposure to SS importantly affected cell cytoskeleton altering actin stress fibers expression and organization, and the distribution of tight junction protein ZO-1. Dome disappearance induced by flow was completely prevented in the presence of EGTA or after cell deciliation.CONCLUSIONSThese data indicate that kidney tubular cells are sensitive to apical flow and that these effects are mediated by primary cilia by regulation of Ca(2+) entry in to the cell. SS induced Ca(2+) entry provokes contraction of cortical actin ring that tenses cell-cell borders and decreases basal stress fibers. These processes may increase paracellular permeability and decrease basal adhesion making dome disappear. Elucidation of the effects of apical fluid flow on tubular cell function may open new insights on the pathophysiology of kidney diseases associated with cilia dysfunction.",0,219

The maximum processing temperature that enables the ordering of block copolymers without introducing any significant degradation of macromolecules is identified.

Analytical chemistry 85(21","Metal nanoparticle (NP) films, prepared by adsorption of NPs from a colloidal solution onto a preconditioned solid substrate, usually form well-dispersed random NP monolayers on the surface. For certain metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu), the NP films display a characteristic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) extinction band, conveniently measured using transmission or reflection ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The surface plasmon band wavelength, intensity, and shape are affected by (among other parameters) the NP spatial distribution on the surface and the effective refractive index (RI) of the surrounding medium. A major concern in the formation of such NP assemblies on surfaces is a commonly observed instability, i.e., a strong tendency of the NPs to undergo aggregation upon removal from the solution and drying, expressed as a drastic change in the LSPR band. Since various imaging modes and applications require dried NP films, preservation of the film initial (wet) morphology and optical properties upon drying are highly desirable. The latter is achieved in the present work by introducing a convenient and generally applicable method for preventing NP aggregation upon drying while preserving the original film morphology and optical response. Stabilization of Au and Ag NP monolayers toward drying is accomplished by coating the immobilized NPs with an ultrathin (3.0-3.5 nm) silica layer, deposited using a sol-gel reaction performed on an intermediate self-assembled aminosilane layer. The thin silica coating prevents NP aggregation and maintains the initial NP film morphology and LSPR response during several cycles of drying and immersion in water.

However, the existential problems are still there. Based upon eastern philosophies and holistic health practices, we propose the body-mind-spirit approach in healthcare settings. Methods: This is a review paper summarizing the application of the approach on various clinical populations. Results: The approach has been trialled with promising results in a number of health conditions and psychosocial predicaments. Spirituality is not restricted to any religious practices, nor is it narrowed to the pursuit of knowledge at a high level of abstraction. The interconnectedness of the body, mind and spirit presupposes that the practice of spirituality is multidimensional and multi-levelled. Conclusions: Using the body-mind-spirit framework flexibly we can engage more clients while facilitating the important process of exploration and change. The key components include getting in touch with the inner self, coming back to our senses, connecting our body and mind and re-balancing our relationship with the natural and social environment. The ultimate goal is to move out of meaninglessness and to reach a state of mature spirituality of tranquillity and transcendence. Relavence to clinical practice: The practice of spirituality can be easily applied to daily life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,224

Investigative ophthalmology & visual science 56(2","PURPOSESilicone oil (SO) has been used as a long-term intraocular tamponade in treating retinal diseases for more than half a decade. However, its propensity to form tiny SO droplets is associated with a number of complications. Currently there is no effective way to remove such droplets from the eye cavity. In this work, a novel cleaner was developed for effective removal of these droplets.METHODSThe cleaner promotes the formation of an oil-in-water-in-oil (O/W/O) double-emulsion that consists of the unwanted droplets as the innermost oil phase. The cleaner's ability to encapsulate SO droplets was tested using both in vitro microdevices and ex vivo porcine eye models. The efficiency of the cleaner in removing the SO droplets was quantified using the three-dimensional (3D) printed eye model. Both the volatility and in vitro cytotoxicity of the cleaner were evaluated on three retinal cell lines.RESULTSCleaner 1.0 is volatile and has an evaporation rate of 0.14 mL/h at room temperature. The formation of O/W/O double-emulsion indicates the encapsulation of SO droplets by the cleaner. In the 3D printed eye model, rinsing with cleaner 1.0 led to a significant reduction of leftover SO droplets compared with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; P < 0.05; n = 6). Cleaner 1.0 did not cause significant cell death (3%-6%) compared with balance salt solution (BSS; 1%-3%) in all three cell lines. The reduction in the cell viability due to cleaner 1.0, relative to that of BSS, was significant only in ARPE-19 cells (27%; P < 0.05) but not in the other two cell lines (8% and 17%, respectively; P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONSThe double-emulsification approach was effective in removing remnant droplets from the eye cavities, and the cleaner was compatible with common cell types encountered in human eyes. The mechanism of toxicity of the proposed cleaner is still unknown, therefore, further in vivo animal tests are needed for full evaluation of the physiological response before the proposed cleaner can be advanced to clinical trials for retinal surgeries.",0,225

The Journal of chemical physics 145(16","The encounter of a nanodrop with a trench on a hysteresis-free surface is explored by many-body dissipative particle dynamics to show the effect of surface roughness on droplet wetting. A free nanodrop exhibits Brownian motion and the diffusivity decays exponentially with the liquid-solid contact area. In contrast, as the nanodrop sits on a trench, its random motion is constrained. Work must be done to overcome the energy barriers for the transition between free and trapped states. The potential energy landscape is thus constructed based on the force-displacement plot. It is shown that the trench acts as a hydrophobic blemish for capture but like a hydrophilic blemish for escape. A drop always breaks up after detachment from a hydrophilic trench. Therefore, the drop tends to bypass a small trench when it meets one. The macroscopic experiments are performed by fabricating liquid-infused surfaces with extremely low contact angle hysteresis. The experimental observations agree qualitatively with simulation outcomes.",0,226

Journal of biomedical optics 14(4","A theoretical model is established for dealing with second-harmonic generation (SHG) in type I collagen excited by linearly polarized light focused by a microscope. With this model, the effects of the polarization angle alpha, numerical aperture (NA), as well as the ratio of hyperpolarizability rho=beta(xxx)beta(xyy) on SHG emission have been investigated. Simulation results reveal that SHG emission power changes periodically as alpha. The use of lower NA leads to weaker SHG emission but is more concentrated in two closer lobes, whereas more distributed emission in two detached lobes appear at higher NA. As the introduction of polarization direction, which is not along with the fiber axis (alpha not equal0 deg), one more element beta(xyy) is valid in our case than beta(xxx) alone, while their ratio rho plays a very important role for collagen features characterization. SHG emission with rho shows complicated modality that SHG emission is different at different alpha and not symmetric at +/-rho except at alpha=0 deg, suggesting the important impact of polarization working on rho for SHG emission. Our theoretical simulation results provide useful clues for experimental study of microscopic SHG emission in collagen excited by linearly polarized beam.",0,227

Biophysical journal 101(2","In active biological contractile processes such as skeletal muscle contraction, cellular mitosis, and neuronal growth, an interesting common observation is that multiple motors can perform coordinated and synchronous actions, whereas individual myosin motors appear to randomly attach to and detach from actin filaments. Recent experiment has demonstrated that, during skeletal muscle shortening at a wide range of velocities, individual myosin motors maintain a force of ~6 pN during a working stroke. To understand how such force-homeostasis can be so precisely regulated in an apparently chaotic system, here we develop a molecular model within a coupled stochastic-elastic theoretical framework. The model reveals that the unique force-stretch relation of myosin motor and the stochastic behavior of actin-myosin binding cause the average number of working motors to increase in linear proportion to the filament load, so that the force on each working motor is regulated at ~6 pN, in excellent agreement with experiment. This study suggests that it might be a general principle to use catch bonds together with a force-stretch relation similar to that of myosin motors to regulate force homeostasis in many biological processes.",0,228

The fluid flow confined in nano-scaled spaces experiences a slip velocity near the wall, which is significantly different to that of bulk water. Here we propose a model combining classic hydrodynamics with kinetic theory to depict the dependency of the slip effect on the oxide concentration of valley plates. The influence of oxidized graphene on water flow is a comprehensive result of a slipped boundary, and depends on both the diffuse reflection coefficient of the wall, and the shrunken effective passageway caused by the electrostatic interactions between the oxidized surface and the water molecules. The former effect enhances the water flow, which reduces with increasing oxide concentration, while the latter effect inhibits water flow. We examine the diffuse reflection coefficient and the shrunken effective passageway at different oxide concentrations of the GO sheets by molecular dynamics simulations, and we quantitively predict the flux relationship at various concentrations. This work provides a molecular insight into transport processes of confined water and a useful guideline for the design of perfect graphene-derived membranes for desalination.",0,229

Two possible phase solutions (φ1 and φ2) generated from two symmetric phase triangles in the Harker construction for the SAD method cause the well known phase ambiguity. A novel direct phase-selection method utilizing the θ(DS) list as a criterion to select optimized phases φ(am) from φ1 or φ2 of a subset of reflections with a high percentage of correct phases to replace the corresponding initial SAD phases φ(SAD) has been developed.

The results show that utilizing the additional direct phase-selection step prior to simple solvent flattening without phase combination using existing DM programs, such as RESOLVE or DM from CCP4, significantly improves the final phases in terms of increased correlation coefficients of electron-density maps and diminished mean phase errors.

Biophysical journal 111(11","In proliferating epithelia of mammalian skin, cells of irregular polygon-like shapes pack into complex, nearly flat two-dimensional structures that are pliable to deformations. In this work, we employ various sensitive correlation functions to quantitatively characterize structural features of evolving packings of epithelial cells across length scales in mouse skin. We find that the pair statistics in direct space (correlation function) and Fourier space (structure factor) of the cell centroids in the early stages of embryonic development show structural directional dependence (statistical anisotropy), which is a reflection of the fact that cells are stretched, which promotes uniaxial growth along the epithelial plane. In the late stages, the patterns tend toward statistically isotropic states, as cells attain global polarization and epidermal growth shifts to produce the skin's outer stratified layers. We construct a minimalist four-component statistical-mechanical model involving effective isotropic pair interactions consisting of hard-core repulsion and extra short-range soft-core repulsion beyond the hard core, whose length scale is roughly the same as the hard core. The model parameters are optimized to match the sample pair statistics in both direct and Fourier spaces. By doing this, the parameters are biologically constrained. In contrast with many vertex-based models, our statistical-mechanical model does not explicitly incorporate information about the cell shapes and interfacial energy between cells; nonetheless, our model predicts essentially the same polygonal shape distribution and size disparity of cells found in experiments, as measured by Voronoi statistics. Moreover, our simulated equilibrium liquid-like configurations are able to match other nontrivial unconstrained statistics, which is a testament to the power and novelty of the model. The array of structural descriptors that we deploy enable us to distinguish between normal, mechanically deformed, and pathological skin tissues. Our statistical-mechanical model enables one to generate tissue microstructure at will for further analysis. We also discuss ways in which our model might be extended to better understand morphogenesis (in particular the emergence of planar cell polarity), wound healing, and disease-progression processes in skin, and how it could be applied to the design of synthetic tissues.",0,232

Here, GO-AgNPs nanocomposite was fabricated through interfacial electrostatic self-assembly and its antifungal activity against phytopathogen Fusarium graminearum was investigated in vitro and in vivo for the first time. The results demonstrated that the GO-AgNPs nanocomposite showed almost a 3- and 7-fold increase of inhibition efficiency over pure AgNPs and GO suspension, respectively. The spore germination inhibition was stimulated by a relatively low concentration of 4.68 μg/mL (minimum inhibition concentration (MIC)). The spores and hyphae were damaged, which might be caused by an antibacterial mechanism from the remarkable synergistic effect of GO-AgNPs, inducing physical injury and chemical reactive oxygen species generation. More importantly, the chemical reduction of GO mediated by fungal spores was possibly contributed to the high antimicrobial activity of GO-AgNPs. Furthermore, the GO-AgNPs nanocomposite showed a significant effect in controlling the leaf spot disease infected by F. graminearum in the detached leaf experiment.

Stepped platinum single crystal electrodes with (111) terraces and step sites of different symmetry were modified by irreversible adsorption of Bi and Te adatoms selectively deposited on steps, and characterized in 0.1 M HClO(4) solution. CO charge-displacement and oxidative stripping were employed to investigate the reactivity changes before and after modification of the electrode surfaces. The values of potential of zero total charge (pztc) determined from CO displacement experiments were found to shift positively on all decorated electrodes. The CO oxidation peaks also shifted to higher potential once the step sites were blocked by the adatoms, indicating a catalytic effect of the step sites for this reaction. The CO coverage values on the step sites were determined by comparing the stripping charges and the change in the hydrogen de/adsorption charge, using the pztc's for double layer correction. The CO coverage was determined to be ca. 0.7 for (110) step sites while only 0.4 for (100) step sites, which suggests a different bond of CO adsorbed on the different step sites. This was confirmed by in situ infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) studies, showing that the (110) step sites are dominated by atop CO while bridged bonded CO are prevalent on (100) step sites.

The tissue distribution of mAbs is affected by many physiologic factors that may be altered in disease status. In the present work, we studied the tissue distribution kinetics of the fusion protein etanercept in inflamed joint tissues and examined the impact of inflammation on the tissue distribution of etanercept. Etanercept concentration profiles in plasma, blister fluid, and different tissues were obtained from healthy and collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats by use of a fluorescence quantification method via IRDye800CW labeling. Stepwise minimal and full physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approaches were applied to characterize the distribution kinetics of etanercept in tissues in healthy and diseased animals. Etanercept exhibited modest tissue access (tissue/plasma area under the concentration curve [AUC] ratios 0.03-0.15 and estimated tissue reflection coefficients [σ] of 0.6-1.0), but with good penetration into arthritic paws (tissue/plasma AUC ratio 0.23 and σ 0.36). Etanercept exposure in the inflamed paws of CIA rats was approximately 3-fold higher than in normal paws taken from either CIA or healthy rats (tissue/plasma AUC ratios 0.23 versus 0.07 and σ 0.36 versus 0.71).

Control cells were polyhedric with short microvilli covering the cell surface, while those exposed to static MF, were elongated with many irregular microvilli randomly distributed on the cell surface.

In parallel with cell shape changes, the microfilaments and microtubules, as well as the quantity and distribution of surface ConA-FITC and Ricinus communnis-FITC labeling sites, were modified in a time dependent manner. Apoptosis, which was almost negligible at the beginning of experiment, increased to about 20% after 24 h of continuous exposure.

However, very little is known about the spatial distribution of dyneins and their cooperativity on smaller cargos, such as vesicles or endosomes <200 nm in size, which are not amenable to conventional immunostaining and optical trapping methods. In this work, we present evidence that dyneins can dynamically be clustered on endosomes in response to load. Using a darkfield imaging assay, we measured the repeated stalls and detachments of retrograde axonal endosomes under load with <10 nm localization accuracy at imaging rates up to 1 kHz for over a timescale of minutes. A three-dimensional stochastic model was used to simulate the endosome motility under load to gain insights on the mechanochemical properties and spatial distribution of dyneins on axonal endosomes. Our results indicate that 1) the distribution of dyneins on endosomes is fluid enough to support dynamic clustering under load and 2) the detachment kinetics of dynein on endosomes differs significantly from the in vitro measurements possibly due to an increase in the unitary stall force of dynein on endosomes.",0,248

(2018"," ""Prevention of violent revictimization in depressed patients with an add-on internet-based emotion regulation training (iERT","Background: Psychiatric patients are at high risk of becoming victim of a violent crime compared to the general population. Although most research has focused on patients with severe mental illness, depressed patients have been demonstrated to be prone to victimization as well. Victimization is associated with more severe symptomatology, decreased quality of life, and high risk of revictimization. Hence, there is a strong need for interventions that focus on preventing violent revictimization. Since emotion dysregulation is associated with both victimization and depression, we developed an internet-based Emotion Regulation Training (iERT) to reduce revictimization in depressed patients. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of iERT added to Treatment As Usual (TAU) in reducing incidents of violent revictimization among depressed patients with a recent history of victimization. Furthermore, this study aims to examine secondary clinical outcomes, and moderators and mediators that may be associated with treatment outcomes. Methods: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial with parallel group design, patients with a major depressive disorder and a history of violent victimization over the past three years (N = 200) will be allocated to either TAU + iERT (N = 100) or TAU only (N = 100), based on computer-generated stratified block randomization. Assessments will take place at baseline, 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 6 months after start of treatment, and 12, 24, and 36 months after baseline. The primary outcome measure is the total number of violent victimization incidents at 12 months after baseline, measured with the Safety Monitor: an adequate self-report questionnaire that assesses victimization over the preceding 12 months. Secondary outcome measures and mediators include emotion dysregulation and depressive symptomatology. An economic evaluation with the societal perspective will be performed alongside the trial. Discussion: This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at reducing violent revictimization in depressed patients. If effective, iERT can be implemented in mental health care, and contribute to the well-being of depressed patients. Furthermore, the results will provide insight into underlying mechanisms of revictimization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,249

Biomedical microdevices 12(3","Despite the importance of cell adhesion in numerous physiological, pathological, and biomaterial-related responses, our understanding of adhesion strength at the cell-substrate interface and its relationship to cell function remains incomplete. One reason for this deficit is a lack of accessible experimental approaches that quantify adhesion strength at the single-cell level and facilitate large numbers of tests. The current work describes the design, fabrication, and use of a microfluidic-based method for single-cell adhesion strength measurements. By applying a monotonically increasing flow rate in a microfluidic channel in combination with video microscopy, the adhesion strength of individual NIH3T3 fibroblasts cultured for 24 h on various surfaces was measured. The small height of the channel allows high shear stresses to be generated under laminar conditions, allowing strength measurements on well-spread, strongly adhered cells that cannot be characterized in most conventional assays. This assay was used to quantify the relationship between morphological characteristics and adhesion strength for individual well-spread cells. Cell adhesion strength was found to be positively correlated with both cell area and circularity. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the role of cell geometry in determining the actual stress applied to the cell. Use of this method to examine adhesion at the single-cell level allows the detachment of strongly-adhered cells under a highly-controllable, uniform loading to be directly observed and will enable the characterization of biological events and relationships that cannot currently be achieved using existing methods.",0,250

Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists","PURPOSEScattering in the eye occurs mainly at two sites: the eye's optical media and the deeper retinal layers. Although the two phenomena are often treated collectively, their spatial domain of contribution to the double-pass Point Spread Function (PSF) is different: the fundus effect is limited to the narrow and middle part of the PSF whereas scattering in the eye's optics extends also to wide angles. The objective of this work was to determine the domain of contribution at the double-pass PSF of light scattered in the ocular media and the ocular fundus, using simulated and experimental data for two different wavelengths and for two different pigmentations.METHODSDiffuse reflection was simulated using Monte Carlo simulations for a four-layer retinal fundus model. Four situations were simulated in total for two different choroidal absorptions at two different wavelengths. Light diffusion in the fundus was the only phenomenon considered in the model. The simulations were compared against experimental fundus reflection data obtained in a previous study.RESULTSThe simulations showed that at 560 nm, diffusion in the fundus causes light to extend to a radius of 2°, independently of the choroidal pigmentation, whereas at 650 nm it extends to radii of 4.5° and 4° for low and high choroidal pigmentation respectively. Experimental data showed a similar behaviour at low angles where light diffusion in the fundus is dominant, but different at higher angles due to scattering in the ocular media.CONCLUSIONThe spatial contribution of light diffused in the ocular fundus to the PSF was found to be limited to narrower angles compared to that of scattering at the ocular media. The comparison of simulated and optical data showed that beyond 2° at 560 nm and 4-4.5° at 650 nm the only phenomenon contributing to the PSF is scattering in the ocular media, whereas the fundus contribution can be assumed as negligible.",0,251

Patient demographics, causes of injury, wound categories, timing and procedures of the primary repair, interval of subsequent intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, follow-up, and postoperative complications were recorded. Additionally, binocular biometry was documented. Twenty-six eyes (86.7%) were open-globe injuries occurring in the workplace. All patients received cataract extraction with primary repair of the penetrating wound, 18 eyes (60%) underwent trans pars plana vitrectomy with lensectomy and 12 eyes (40%) underwent lens aspiration or extracapsular cataract extraction. Simultaneously, 16 eyes (53.3%) underwent intraocular foreign body removal.RESULTSThe mean visual improvement after secondary IOL implantation was statistically significant (p = 0.002). Seventeen eyes (56.7%) achieved final best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better. The mean deviation of final refraction and target refraction was -0.69 +/- 0.56 diopter, and 23 eyes (76.7%) were within 1 diopter based on biometry of the traumatic eye. In 18 eyes (60%), the difference was within 1 diopter according to biometry of the fellow eye. In 5 cases (16.7%), there was no improvement of vision because of central corneal scar, secondary glaucoma, macular pucker, or recurrent retinal detachment.INTERPRETATIONThe vision of patients with traumatic cataract in open-globe injury was improved after prompt surgical intervention and subsequent IOL implantation. A minority of patients experienced no change in vision or a deterioration of vision due to irregular astigmatism caused by a corneal wound or variable damage to the posterior segment. Using biometry of the injured eye after primary repair was more accurate than using biometry of the fellow eye to determine the power of the lens for IOL implantation in variable open-globe injury.",0,253

Perspectives in biology and medicine 54(3","Prior to Patrick Manson's discovery in 1877 that the mosquito Culex fatigans was the intermediate host of filariasis, the association of insects with disease and the nature of disease transmission was almost entirely speculation. Manson's work was incomplete, however, because it showed the manner in which the mosquito acquired the infection from humans, but failed to show the way in which the mosquito passed the infection to humans. That pathogens were transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito was later proven experimentally with bird malaria by Manson's protégé, Ronald Ross. In 1898 Ross demonstrated that the infective stage of the malarial parasite was injected into the host when the mosquito released saliva into the wound prior to injesting blood. Insects were suspected as carriers of disease for centuries, yet it was not until the late 1870s that the uncritical acceptance of folk beliefs was supplanted by research-based scientific medicine. Why did it take so long? The answer lies in the fact that early medicine itself was imprecise and could not have pursued the subject with any hope of useful results until the last quarter of the 19th century. A better understanding of the nature of the disease process (germ theory of disease) and improved technology (microscopes and oil-immersion lenses with greater resolving power, and synthetic tissue stains) were indispensable for revealing the nexus between those partners in crime: insects and parasites.",0,256

Despite its increasing usage in the cardiovascular system, to our knowledge WIA has never been applied to the respiratory system. Given the analogies between arteries and airways (i.e. fluid flow in flexible vessels), the aim of this work is to test the applicability of WIA with gas flow instead of liquid flow. The models employed in this study are similar to earlier studies used for arterial investigations. Simultaneous pressure (P) and velocity (U) measurements were initially made in a single tube and then in several flexible tubes connected in series. Wave speed was calculated using the foot-to-foot method (cf), which was used to separate analytically the measured P and U waveforms into their forward and backward components. Further, the data were used to calculate wave intensity, which was also separated into its forward and backward components. Although the measured wave speed was relatively high, the results showed that the onsets and the nature of reflections (compression/expansion) derived with WIA, corresponded well to those anticipated using the theory of waves in liquid-filled elastic tubes. On average the difference between the experimental and theoretical arrival time of reflection was 6.1% and 3.6% for the single vessel and multivessel experiment, respectively. The results suggest that WIA can provide relatively accurate information on reflections in air-filled flexible tubes, warranting further studies to explore the full potential of this technique in the respiratory system.",0,259

The experiments utilize a pump-probe scheme to determine the OH X 2Pi population distribution following collisional quenching in a pulsed supersonic expansion. The pump laser excites OH A 2Sigma+ (nu'=0, N'=0), which has a significantly reduced fluorescence lifetime due to quenching by H2. The probe laser monitors the OH X 2Pi (nu"", N"") population via laser-induced fluorescence on various A-X transitions under single collision conditions. The experiments reveal a high degree of rotational excitation (N"") of the quenched OH X 2Pi products observed in nu""=1 and 2 as well as a pronounced propensity for quenching into the Pi(A') Lambda-doublet level. These experiments have been supplemented by extensive multireference, configuration-interaction calculations aimed at exploring the topology of the relevant potential energy surfaces. Electronic quenching of OH A 2Sigma+ by H2 proceeds through conical intersections between two potentials of A' reflection symmetry (in planar geometry) that correlate with the electronically excited A 2Sigma+ and ground X 2Pi states of OH. The conical intersections occur in high-symmetry geometries, in which the O side of OH points toward H2. Corroborating and extending earlier work of Hoffman and Yarkony [J. Chem. Phys. 113, 10091 (2000)], these calculations reveal a steep gradient away from the OH-H2 conical intersection as a function of both the OH orientation and interfragment distance.

Emerging themes in epidemiology 10(1","BACKGROUNDSystems for animal disease mitigation involve both surveillance activities and interventions to control the disease. They are complex organizations that are described by partial or imprecise data, making it difficult to evaluate them or make decisions to improve them. A mathematical method, called loop analysis, can be used to model qualitatively the structure and the behavior of dynamic systems; it relies on the study of the sign of the interactions between the components of the system. This method, currently widely used by ecologists, has to our knowledge never been applied in the context of animal disease mitigation systems. The objective of the study was to assess whether loop analysis could be applied to this new context. We first developed a generic model that restricted the applicability of the method to event-based surveillance systems of endemic diseases, excluding the emergence and eradication phases. Then we chose the mitigation system of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in Cambodia as an example of such system to study the application of loop analysis to a real disease mitigation system.RESULTSBreaking down the generic model, we constructed a 6-variables model to represent the HPAI H5N1 mitigation system in Cambodia. This construction work improved our understanding of this system, highlighting the link between surveillance and control which is unclear in traditional representations of this system. Then we analyzed the effect of the perturbations to this HPAI H5N1 mitigation system that we interpreted in terms of investment in a given compartment. This study suggested that increasing intervention at a local level can optimize the system's efficiency. Indeed, this perturbation both decreases surveillance and intervention costs and reduces the disease's occurrence.CONCLUSIONLoop analysis can be applied to disease mitigation systems. Its main strength is that it is easy to design, focusing on the signs of the interactions. It is a simple and flexible tool that could be used as a precursor to large-scale quantitative studies, to support reflection about disease mitigation systems structure and functioning.",0,263

The alternative to this hypothesis was also evaluated by testing whether lower initial levels of executive functioning predicted increases in rumination or depressive symptoms at follow-up. Methods: A community sample of 200 adolescents (ages 12e13) completed measures of depressive symptoms, rumination, and executive functioning at baseline and at a follow-up session approximately 15 months later. Results: Adolescents with higher levels of baseline rumination displayed decreases in selective attention and attentional switching at follow-up. Rumination did not predict changes in working memory or sustained and divided attention. Depressive symptoms were not found to predict significant changes in executive functioning scores at follow-up. Baseline executive functioning was not associated with change in rumination or depression over time. Conclusions: Findings partially support the resource allocation hypothesis that engaging in ruminative thoughts consumes cognitive resources that would otherwise be allocated towards difficult tests of executive functioning. Support was not found for the alternative hypothesis that lower levels of initial executive functioning would predict increased rumination or depressive symptoms at follow-up.

Current animal and human research demonstrates that myopia development is a result of the interplay between genetic and the environmental factors. The prevalence of myopia is higher in individuals whose both parents are myopic, suggesting that genetic factors are clearly involved in myopia development. At the same time, population studies suggest that development of myopia is associated with education and the amount time spent doing near work; hence, activities increase the exposure to optical blur.

Colonies in the petri dish are epi-illuminated in order to direct the reflection of concentrated light coming from a halogen lamp towards an image-sensing device. In conjunction, a multilevel threshold algorithm is proposed for colony separation and counting. These procedures improved the quantification of colonies showing confluence or differences in size. We tested COVASIAM with a sample set of microorganisms that form colonies with contrasting physical properties: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, Escherichia coli, Azotobacter vinelandii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhizobium etli. These physical properties range from smooth to hairy, from bright to opaque, and from high to low convexities. COVASIAM estimated an average of 95.47% (sigma = 8.55%) of the manually counted colonies, while an automated method based on a single-threshold segmentation procedure estimated an average of 76% (sigma = 16.27) of the manually counted colonies. This method can be easily transposed to almost every image-processing analyzer since the procedures to compile it are generically standard.",0,270

Family Practice 24(4","Background: Depressive symptoms are common in primary care, yet considerable professional controversy exists about appropriate management including the effectiveness of treatments. In addition, avoiding prescribing antidepressants at least initially is recommended. Views of patients themselves should therefore be particularly important in agreeing management strategies. Objective: To examine lay beliefs about depressive symptoms in primary care. Method: A total of 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients scoring positively for depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score in a primary care setting. Results: Differentiating 'depression' from understandable reactions to adversity was difficult for patients. The wide range of consequences discussed included adverse effects on others, difficulties coping with feeling out of control and loss of self-identity. Negative images of depression, such as depression being a 20th century phenomenon, were pervasive. Views about medication varied. Various management strategies described included strategies of detachment, engagement in activities and 'blotting out' symptoms. Conclusions: Patients' views about depressive symptoms are significantly different from conventional medical views. A 'disease management approach' fits uncomfortably with patients' experiences. Acknowledging feelings of loss of control and loss of self-identity in consultations may be useful. The wide employment of techniques patients use to control their disorders, such as support from others, engagement in activities and working at relationships, may be useful to encourage in consultations as alternatives to the use of antidepressant medication.

(2018"," ""Plasticity and consistency of lying and ruminating behaviours of heifers exposed to different cubicle availability: A glance at individuality."" Applied Animal Behaviour Science 205: 1-7.","Behavioural responses are a balance between plasticity (changes in behavioural patterns in relation to the environment) and consistency (similar behavioural responses in different situations). In addition, behavioural consistency indicates the presence of individuality, that is, a degree of internal consistency in the way individuals respond to situations. The estimation of the strength of plasticity and consistency in behaviour is a way to explore how coping mechanisms work and the degree to which environmental changes and individuality influence behavioural responses. Therefore, this study evaluated the balance between plasticity and consistency in the rumination and lying patterns of heifers exposed to three cubicle availabilities by comparing the effect size estimates of a repeated measures ANOVA (plasticity) and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (consistency). Heifers lay and ruminated less time on average as cubicle availability decreased (Total lying: F = 15.382,28; P < 0.0001 and Total rumination: F = 167.762,28; P < 0.0001). Rumination had a stronger effect size estimate of plasticity (Total rumination: 0.88 > 0.38), probably as a result of the importance of this activity for cows’ energy acquisition and the low energy cost of this activity. Lying behaviours tended more towards consistency (Total lying: 0.81 > 0.59), most likely to avoid the energy costs of plasticity at individual level. Individuals are consistent in their lying behaviour, which can cause health risks if, despite changes in the environment, heifers lie for too long or not long enough. Further research is needed to address the relationship of individuality and expression of basic behaviours, such as lying and rumination, and the role of individuality in disease prevention.

IoT abuse in distributed denial of service attacks is a major issue, as typical IoT devices' limited computing, communications, and power resources are prioritized in implementing functionality rather than security features. Incidents involving attacks have been reported, but without clear characterization and evaluation of threats and impacts. The main purpose of this work is to methodically assess the possible impacts of a specific class-amplified reflection distributed denial of service attacks (AR-DDoS)-against IoT. The novel approach used to empirically examine the threat represented by running the attack over a controlled environment, with IoT devices, considered the perspective of an attacker. The methodology used in tests includes that perspective, and actively prospects vulnerabilities in computer systems. This methodology defines standardized procedures for tool-independent vulnerability assessment based on strategy, and the decision flows during execution of penetration tests (pentests). After validation in different scenarios, the methodology was applied in amplified reflection distributed denial of service (AR-DDoS) attack threat assessment. Results show that, according to attack intensity, AR-DDoS saturates reflector infrastructure. Therefore, concerns about AR-DDoS are founded, but expected impact on abused IoT infrastructure and devices will be possibly as hard as on final victims.",0,273

It describes the organizational arrangement of the Brazilian health system, for the purpose of reflection on the austerity agenda proposed for the country. Based on the literature in health economics, it discusses the hypothesis that the health sector in Brazil functions under the dominance of the private sector. The categories employed for analysis are those of the national health spending figures. An international comparison of indicators of health expenses shows that Brazilian public spending is a low proportion of total spending on Brazilian health. Expenditure on individuals' health by out-of-pocket payments is high, and this works against equitability. The private health services sector plays a crucial role in provision, and financing. Contrary to the belief put forward by the austerity agenda, public expenditure cannot be constrained because the government has failed in adequate provision of services to the poor. This paper argues that, since the Constitution did not veto activity by the private sector segment of the market, those interests that have the greatest capacity to vocalize have been successful in imposing their preferences in the configuration of the sector.",0,274

Environmental management 36(5","A skyscraper is as natural as a bird's nest -Alan Watts. For millennia, people have altered freshwater ecosystems directly through water development and indirectly by global change and surrounding land-use activities. In these altered ecosystems, human impacts can be subtle and are sometimes overlooked by the people who manage them. This article provides two case studies near Boulder, Colorado that demonstrate how perceptions regarding these ecosystems affect their management. These examples are typical of lakes and streams along the Front Range of Colorado that are simultaneously natural and social in origin. Although natural, many of the region's freshwater ecosystems are affected by ongoing ecologic, hydrologic, chemical, and geomorphic modifications produced by human activity. People and nature are both active participants in the production of these freshwater ecosystems. The concept of ""hybridity,"" borrowed from geographers and social scientists, is useful for describing landscapes of natural and social origin. Hybrid freshwater ecosystems are features of the humanized landscape and are derived from deliberate cultural activities, nonhuman physical and biological processes, and incidental anthropogenic disturbance. Our perceptions of ""natural"" freshwater ecosystems and what definitions we use to describe them influences our view of hybrid systems and, in turn, affects management decisions regarding them. This work stresses the importance of understanding the underlying societal forces and cultural values responsible for the creation of hybrid freshwater ecosystems as a central step in their conservation and management.",0,277

By addressing the waveguide structure with alternate polarisations the optogeometrical properties (density and thickness) of adsorbed protein layers at the sensor (solid)-liquid interface have been determined. Differences in the waveguide mode dispersion between the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes allow unique solutions for adlayer thickness and refractive index to be determined at all stages during the formation process. The technique has been verified using standard protein systems and by comparing the data with published work using X-ray crystallography and neutron reflection techniques. The data obtained was found to be in excellent agreement with previously reported X-ray experiments given that typical film thicknesses for streptavidin layers were in the range 5.5-6.5 nm compared with the short axis crystal structure of between 4.8 and 5.6 nm. The precision of the measurements taken was of the order of 40 pm with respect to adsorbed adlayer thicknesses. This biosensor approach provides measurements of both thickness and density of adlayers to a high precision, simultaneously and in real time enabling detail of the structure and function of proteins to be elucidated. From such data it is possible to obtain information on the orientation, distortion and efficiency of immobilisation procedures as well as the interaction event of interest.

In reality, the dangling bond density (DBD) at contacting surfaces can vary greatly. Currently, it remains unclear how friction and wear mechanisms depend on DBDs and whether the Archard's law for wear and Amonton's law for friction are still applicable for contacting surfaces with different DBDs. In this work, we address these issues by studying the wear and friction behavior between two sliding diamond-like carbon surfaces by controlling DBDs via hydrogenation using molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the chemical bond breaking and remaking across the contacting interface play the key role in determining the friction and wear behavior. During the sliding, a higher DBD leads to more chemical bond formations across the interface, causing stronger wear via either atom or cluster detachments. With the same DBD, a mechanism transition from an atom-by-atom to cluster detachments is observed by increasing the normal load. Remarkably, a fully saturated surface can exhibit a wearless friction. We further show that after necessary modifications, the Archard's law for wear and the Amonton's law for friction may be applicable at the nanoscale. The present work reveals insights into the effect of interface chemistry on the friction and wear, and it provides guidelines for effective antiwear design.",0,280

Within 3–7 days, they completed a two-back task with a series of self-irrelevant or self-relevant emotional words (they had generated previously) and four conditions (match‐set, break‐set, perseveration‐set, and no‐set). After the WM task, an unexpected recall task was administered; controls recalled more positive self-relevant words and intrusions while dysphoric participants recalled more negative self-relevant words and intrusions. In break-set trials of the two-back task, dysphoric individuals showed slower response to self-relevant words regardless of valence. In the match-set and perseveration-set trials, dysphoric participants showed delayed response to self-related negative words. Moreover, longer reaction times for self-relevant negative words were correlated with higher rumination and worse depression. The results suggest that dysphoric undergraduates are interfered more by and have a better memory of self-relevant negative stimuli in WM, which is closely correlated with rumination.

Clin Exp Med 18(2","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease of undefined etiology and with remarkably heterogeneous clinical features. Virtually any organ system can be affected, including the eye. SLE-related eye involvement can be diagnosed in approximately one-third of the patients and is usually indicative of disease activity. An early diagnosis and the adoption of suitable therapeutic measures are necessary to prevent sight-threatening consequences, especially in patients with juvenile SLE. Periocular lesions, such as eyelid involvement and orbital inflammation, are relatively rare and, in case of orbital masses, may require a biopsy control. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or secondary Sjogren's syndrome is the most frequent ophthalmic manifestation of SLE. According to its variable severity, lubricating tear drops may be sufficient in mild cases, whereas cyclosporine-A ophthalmic solution, glucocorticoids (GCs), methotrexate, and/or other immunosuppressive drugs may be required in the more severe cases. Partial occlusion of the lacrimal punctum by thermal cautery is rarely applied. Although uncommon, episcleritis and scleritis can sometimes be detected as an initial finding of SLE and reveal themselves as moderate to intense ocular pain, redness, blurred vision, and lacrimation. Unilateral or more often bilateral retinopathy is responsible for visual loss of variable severity and is ascribed to vasculitis of the retinal capillaries and arterioles. In addition to the combined treatment suitable for all patients with active SLE, intravitreal bevacizumab should be considered in cases of severe vaso-occlusive retinopathy and laser photocoagulation in cases of neovascularization. Purtscher-like retinopathy is likely ascribable to the formation of microemboli that results in retinal vascular occlusion and microvascular infarcts. Choroidal disease is characterized by monolateral or bilateral blurred vision. Because of the choroidal effusion, retinal detachment and secondary angle-closure glaucoma may occur. Ischemic optic neuropathy is characterized by acute-onset and progressive binocular visual impairment as a consequence of occlusion of the small vessels of the optic nerves due to immune complex vasculitis. Intravenous GC boluses followed by oral GCs and/or, in case of recurrence, intravenous cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab are commonly employed. Neovascularization can be treated by intravitreal bevacizumab and progression of retinal ischemic areas by retinal laser photocoagulation. Ocular adverse events (AE) have been described following the long-term administration of one or more of the drugs presently used for the treatment of SLE patients. Posterior subcapsular cataracts and secondary open-angle glaucoma are common AE of the prolonged GC administration. The long-term administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate is well known to be associated with AE, such as vortex keratopathy and in particular the often irreversible and sight-threatening maculopathy. Length of administration > 5 years, > 1000 g total HCQ consumption, > 6.5 mg/kg daily dosing, coexistence of renal disease, and preexisting maculopathy are all considered risk factors for HCQ-induced retinopathy. Ocular AE of additional immunosuppressive and biological agents are still poorly known, given the worldwide more limited experience with their long-term use. A thorough ophthalmological control is strongly recommended at closer intervals for all SLE patients, in step with the total length of exposure to the drugs and the cumulative dose administered.",0,285

The structural, electronic, dielectric, magnetic, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties of PTH/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2-xCexO4 composites were investigated. Our results suggest that these properties could be optimized by modulating the concentration of x (composition) in the polymer matrix. Higher values of ε' and ε'' were obtained on composite formation, and could be due to the heterogeneity developed in the material. An enhancement in the value of saturation magnetization (123 emu g-1 for x = 0.04) and Curie temperature was obtained with Ce concentration, which is useful for high density recording purposes. A low value of saturation magnetization was obtained for the PTH/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2-xCexO4 composite (36 emu g-1 for x = 0.04). This could be attributed to the non-magnetic nature of the polymer. A total shielding effectiveness (SET = SEA + SER) up to 34 dB (≈99.9% attenuation) was recorded for PTH/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2-xCexO4 composites (x = 0.04) in a frequency range of 8.2-12.4 GHz (X-band), which surpasses the shielding criteria of SET > 30 dB for commercial purposes. Such a material with high SE identifies its potential for making electromagnetic shields. The effect of Ce substitution on the microstructure, dielectric, impedance and magnetic properties of PTH/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2-xCexO4 ferrite composites was also investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed cubic spinel phase formation, and the broad reflection peaks indicated the formation of smaller sized particles.

Several testing conditions and instrumental parameters were tested in order to evaluate the mucoadhesive potential of a model vaginal semisolid formulation (1% Carbopol 974P gel). Also, mucoadhesive potential of several commercially available vaginal semisolid products was evaluated. Obtained results showed that the method is reproducible even when the same cow mucosa sample is used up to six times. The similarity of the fluid used to bathe the vaginal mucosa to the one naturally occurring in the vagina influenced considerably the performance of the test, advising that simulation of vaginal fluid properties is important when measuring mucoadhesive properties. Also, temperature of experiment was an important fact to be considered, as results showed slight but significant differences between body (37 degrees C) and room (20 degrees C) temperature. Fdt and Wad increased with increasing instrumental parameters while a plateau region was observable at higher values of probe speed, probe force, and mucosa/sample contact time. Comparison between results for Fdt and Wad demonstrated that although both parameters are generally in agreement, Wad seems to be more reliable and reproducible when evaluating mucoadhesion. Evaluation of commercially available formulations confirmed that experimental conditions are important features that can influence significantly the determination of mucoadhesive potential, being the proposed method an interesting and useful tool in the in vitro evaluation of vaginal semisolids.",0,290

Applied optics 54(16","In the present work, the Talbot effect of a square grating is analyzed when light is reflected from a rough surface. It is shown theoretically that the scattered light intensity in the Fresnel diffraction limit depends on statistical properties of the rough surface, the angle of incidence of the light, the grating period, and a geometric coefficient, related to the ratio of distance of the rough surface and the observation plane from the grating. At Talbot distances of the grating, the surface height difference function, in terms of multiplication of the Talbot number, the grating period, and the geometric coefficient is the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the scattering in reflection from the rough surface. If the argument of the height difference function is larger than twice the surface correlation length, the height difference function is constant for different spatial frequencies. Therefore, the square wave is reproduced with smaller contrast. The surface roughness can be obtained by measuring the contrast at different incident angles. It is also shown that the contrast measurements in both reflection and transmission, provide the refractive index of transparent samples with a rough surface. In experimental studies, the roughness of three metal standard rough surfaces are determined at different angles of incidence. Also, the refractive index of a sheet glass with a rough surface is obtained. The results are quite consistent.",0,291

BMC Ophthalmol 18(1","BACKGROUND: A major obstacle that academic institutions face is the steep learning curve for cornea fellows initially learning to perform Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of complex DSEK performed by cornea fellow supervised by an attending surgeon at an academic institution. METHODS: Patients who underwent a complex DSEK procedure performed by a cornea fellow during the years 2009-2013 were included. All the surgeries were supervised by the same cornea attending. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Charts were reviewed for demographic data, intraoperative and postoperative complications and clinical outcomes. Corneal graft survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-seven eyes of 55 patients (mean age 77.5 +/- 8.5 years) were included in the study with a mean follow-up time of 16.4 +/- 15.6 months. Previous graft failure, presence of a tube and history of trabeculectomy were the leading diagnoses to define the surgery as complex. No intraoperative complications occurred. In 21.1% of cases a corneal graft detachment was documented in the first postoperative day. Mean visual acuity improved from 1.06 LogMAR (20/230) preoperatively to 0.39 LogMAR (20/50, p < 0.001) by the sixth postoperative month and to 0.52 LogMAR (20/65, p < 0.001) at the last follow-up visit. Graft failure rate was 29.8%. Kaplan-Meier analysis found a 67.2% graft survival rate at 20 months. CONCLUSIONS: Complex DSEK can be performed successfully with an acceptable postoperative complication rate by cornea fellows during their training period when supervised by an experienced attending.",0,292
293,"De Backer, J. (2009"," ""Cardiovascular characteristics in Marfan syndrome and their relation to the genotype."" Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie 71(6","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of connective tissue with autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis of MFS is based on the identification of a combination of clinical manifestations in the ocular, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular organ systems defined in the Ghent Nosology (De Paepe et al, 1996). Confirmation of the diagnosis in an individual requires the presence of major clinical manifestations in at least two organ systems associated with involvement of a third organ system. In relatives of an affected proband, major involvement of one organ system and involvement of a second organ system confirms the diagnosis. Major clinical criteria are very specific for MFS and include a combination of (4 out of 8) skeletal manifestations, ectopia lentis, dural ectasia and dilatation or dissection of the ascending aorta. The prevalence of- and the guidelines for the assessment of each of these major criteria are well established. Minor clinical criteria are less typical, but their importance in the diagnostic process should not be underestimated. Unfortunately, figures on the prevalence as well as practical guidelines for the assessment of most minor criteria are lacking, especially for those involving the cardiovascular system. The major cardiovascular manifestation in MFS is a progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta, leading to aortic aneurysm formation and eventually to fatal aortic rupture or dissection. Aortic dissection in early adult life is the leading cause of death in MFS. Early diagnosis of individuals at risk of the disease is extremely important as timely treatment of cardiovascular complications has greatly improved life expectancy in MFS. Despite progress in medical and surgical treatment of aortic aneurysms, MFS continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This may be related to inadequate diagnosis or treatment, but also to the occurrence of cardiovascular problems in ageing MFS patients that were unrecognised until now, such as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.This thesis is focused on the study of cardiovascular manifestations of MFS which localize beyond the aortic root and on the presently unknown relationship between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype and the genotype. In the first part, we have studied the prevalence and diagnostic value of the following cardiovascular manifestations of MFS: mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and calcification of the mitral valve annulus, dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and dilatation or dissection of the descending aorta. We found a significantly higher prevalence of MVP in MFS patients compared to normal controls, indicating that this feature is useful in the diagnostic evaluation of the condition. In contrast, calcification of the mitral valve annulus appears to be very uncommon, difficult to quantify and therefore not useful in the diagnosis of MFS. We also studied the dimension of the MPA in a series of MFS patients and defined a cut-of value that can be used in the diagnostic evaluation of adult MFS patients. In addition, we showed that diameters of the aorta measured at different levels beyond the aortic root are increased in MFS patients compared to controls. Unfortunately, there was too much overlap with the values obtained in the normal control population to provide cut-off values for the descending aorta. Based on these findings, we developed practical guidelines for the cardiovascular evaluation of patients referred for MFS. In the second part, we studied LV function in MFS patients free of valvular heart disease using a combination of echocardiography (both conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We could demonstrate that MFS patients present a combination of systolic and diastolic dysfunction that is not related to valvular heart disease. This may be attributed to a primary contractile dysfunction of the myocardium and is likely related to the underlying alterations in the elastic features of the myocardium, resulting from the microfibrill r defect. This observation is important in the development of new therapeutic strategies for MFS. Affected individuals may benefit from a treatment with agents that support myocardial function such as angiotensin converting enzyme--inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers. Furthermore, since MFS patients survive longer thanks to improved medical and surgical treatments, LV dysfunction may become an important issue in the follow-up of these patients. In the third part, we have studied aspects of local and global wave reflection in the aorta of MFS patients. Early return of reflected waves boosts systolic pressure and presents an extra load for the heart and the central vessels. As such, these wave reflections are regarded as one of the important determinants of central blood pressure and can contribute to the development of aortic dilatation in MFS. However, we were unable to demonstrate clear differences in both local and global parameters of wave reflection between MFS patients and normal controls. This could be explained by the fact that increased length of the aorta on the one hand and increased aortic stiffness on the other hand counterbalance each other in MFS patients without yielding any net effect on wave reflection. In the last part of this thesis, we investigated the correlation between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype in MFS and the type of FBN1 mutation. First, we investigated the correlation between parameters of aortic stiffness (distensibility and pulse wave velocity measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and the type of FBN1 mutation (missense or in-frame deletions/insertions versus nonsense or out-of-frame deletions/insertions). We could not demonstrate any significant differences between these different mutation types, indicating that the FBN1 genotype is not the sole determinant of aortic stiffness. Second, we provided a detailed description of clinical findings in three unrelated MFS families in which an FBN1 mutation was identified and which demonstrate striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability as another illustration of the absence of genotype/phenotype correlations in MFS. This study also illustrated several important issues in MFS. First, repeated clinical examination of suspected patients can be necessary in order to establish a correct and final diagnosis. Second, extensive family history taking and clinical examination of first degree relatives can be highly contributory to the diagnosis. Third, patients with an 'atypical' MFS phenotype may show substantial clinical overlap with other connective tissue disorders such as Weill-Marchesani syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and represent a diagnostic challenge. We demonstrated that additional mutational analysis of the FBN1 gene can be a valuable aid to the diagnosis and help to outline medical management options in these challenging cases. In conclusion, we have refined diagnostic guidelines for the assessment of minor cardiovascular manifestations in MFS, shown that LV dysfunction is part of the cardiovascular spectrum and should be followed in the management of MFS patients, and demonstrated that aortic wave reflection is not elevated in MFS. In this work, we also investigated genotype/phenotype correlations, illustrated the marked (intrafamilial) variability in phenotypic expression of the condition, and the value of molecular testing in the diagnosis of MFS. Overall, this thesis nicely illustrates that close interaction and collaboration between cardiology and genetics is an added value to the study of disease pathogenesis of MFS and aortic aneurysms in general.",0,293

Biomolecular engineering 24(5","Cell adhesion on a biomaterial is an important phase of the cell-material interactions and the quality of this phase governs the success of the biomaterial integration. Understanding of the phenomena of cell adhesion and in particular understanding of cell adhesion on biomaterials is of crucial importance for the development of new biomaterials with excellent biocompatibility. One of the physical quantitative indexes to evaluate the quality of cell-material adhesion is its strength. Determining the strength of adhesive bonds requires applying external forces to the cells. Thus, a few methods have been developed to evaluate the strength of cell-material adhesion (micropipette, microplates, microcantilever, ...). These methods apply shear forces on adherent cells. The aim of our work is the development of a new ultrasonic characterization method of cellular adhesion on substrates. With our method, longitudinal acoustic waves are applied on cell culture to impose a longitudinal strain on cells. Only the cells subjected to a sufficient level of strain will be detached from the substrate. The idea is to correlate cell detachment rate to the longitudinal strain threshold supported by cells. From this result, we can deduce the critical force just sufficient to detach the cell. This global method can be adapted for different cell types and for different substrates. This method can provide an evaluation of the effect of functionalization on substrates. The technique is investigated for the 200 kHz ultrasound frequency. An insonificator adapted to the use of cell culture boxes was developed and calibrated. Tests were carried out on a glass substrate with or without biological conditioning.

Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP 13(23","The hydriding kinetics of Pd thin films has been investigated in detail. The in situ experimental technique used in this work consists of a high resolution curvature measurement setup, which continuously monitors the reflections of multiple laser beams reflecting off a cantilevered sample. After mounting the sample inside a vacuum chamber, a H-containing gas mixture is introduced to instantaneously generate a given hydrogen partial pressure (p(H(2))) inside the chamber. The resulting interaction of hydrogen with the Pd layer then leads to a volume expansion of the thin film system. This induces in turn changes in the sample curvature as a result of internal stresses developing in the Pd film during a hydriding cycle. Based on such in situ curvature data, three different kinetic regimes have been resolved. The first two exhibited a linear increase of the internal stress in the compressive direction with time. A systematic study of the p(H(2))-dependency of the two constant slopes was performed, based on newly derived constitutive kinetic equations. This resulted in the identification of the first linear regime to be limited by absorption and the second one by adsorption. After adsorption equilibrium is reached at the end of the second regime, a third, non-linear kinetic regime, limited by absorption, was found to precede the final hydriding equilibrium. This switch back to absorption-limited kinetics likely occurs due to a coverage dependent change in the adsorption enthalpy of the surface hydrogen. Furthermore, from our in situ experimental data, relevant kinetic and thermodynamic hydriding parameters have been derived. As a result, this study was able to provide a self-consistent quantitative interpretation of the entire Pd room temperature hydriding cycle in the alpha-phase domain.",0,302

Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing.","WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: Euthanasia because of unbearable mental suffering (UMS euthanasia) has been legal in Belgium since 2002 under strict conditions of careful practice. UMS euthanasia occurs fairly rarely in Belgium, but the frequency has increased substantially over the past few years. Although most mental health nurses play an important role and are supportive of euthanasia in general, their role, attitude and knowledge when it comes to UMS euthanasia were unknown until now. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Most mental health nurses in Belgium appear to be supportive towards UMS euthanasia and where UMS euthanasia is carried out, mental health nurses are often involved in the preceding decision-making process. Mental health nurses critically reflect on the interpretation and application of the legal euthanasia criteria as experienced in their daily work with their patients, and identify several problems. After a rather quiet period in Belgium, the public ethical debate regarding UMS euthanasia has recently been reopened and intensified. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Sufficient attention must be paid to how mental health nurses can be involved in the process of UMS euthanasia. This applies at several levels: legal, healthcare policy, bedside care and education. Specific attention must be paid within the UMS euthanasia process to ensure adequate cooperation between physicians, nurses and patients. There is a need for proper training in: knowledge of psychiatric pathologies and remaining treatment options; communication skills; the legal framework and all its difficulties; transdisciplinary and multicultural approaches; ethical reflection and how nurses handle their own emotions.ABSTRACTIntroduction Euthanasia because of unbearable mental suffering (UMS euthanasia) has been legal in Belgium since 2002, under certain circumstances that govern careful practice. Despite the legal framework, there are specific difficulties and concerns regarding UMS euthanasia. Mental health nurses are often involved in the process, but little is known about their attitudes towards UMS euthanasia, their role and their knowledge. Aim To determine the attitudes, role and knowledge of mental health nurses regarding UMS euthanasia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was performed at a convenience sample of four psychiatric hospitals in Belgium (n = 133) as a pilot study. Self-administered questionnaires were provided to mental health nurses. Results Half the nurses in our sample had been involved at least once in the process of UMS euthanasia. A large majority of mental health nurses were supportive of UMS euthanasia. Nurses show differences in attitudes related to the different psychiatric pathologies of the patients, and in whether or not minors are involved. In some cases, they believed that the mental suffering of psychiatric patients can be unbearable and irreversible and that psychiatric patients can be competent to voluntarily request UMS euthanasia. Nurses stated that they have an important role in the UMS euthanasia process, but also demanded more knowledge and clear guidelines to implement the procedure. Discussion Nurses have a key role regarding UMS euthanasia but face several challenges: the recent process, resistance to a multidisciplinary approach by psychiatrists and an unclear role defined by the legal framework. Nurses do not appear to have a common voice on the topic and the development of clear guidelines appears to be essential. Social recovery can offer a way out of an UMS euthanasia request, but it will not always offer a solution. Implications for Practice Sufficient attention must be paid to how mental health nurses can be involved in the process of UMS euthanasia at various levels: bedside practice, healthcare management, education and policy. A form of systematic cooperation between nurses, physicians and patients can contribute to the utmost careful decision-making process needed in these cases. There is a need for proper training in: knowledge of psychiatric pathologies and r maining treatment options; communication skills; the legal framework and all its difficulties; transdisciplinary and multicultural approaches; ethical reflection and how nurses handle their own emotions.",0,303

Journal of Clinical Nursing 18(6","AIMTo test changes in adherence to nurses' falls prevention work resulting from improving attitudes and ownership of practice.BACKGROUNDWorkforce surveys indicate that nurses leave nursing because they cannot deliver the care they value. When challenged why, nurses claim no power of decision-making or authority to change their work with dissatisfaction and disengagement with work ensuing. Nurses espouse 'caring' but are observed taking risks with patients' safety reflecting poor congruence between values and behaviours. Attitudes and decision-making involvement are factors that influence work behaviours. Hence, increased adherence should be achieved by improving nurses' attitudes through active decision-making surrounding practice.DESIGNMixed methods study.METHODSMixed methods were employed during 2004 by surveying attitudes (self-esteem, professional values and work satisfaction) before and after re-engineering nurses' work using practice development (PD) to gain time to spend in prevention work. Practice behaviour was observed and measured at intervals during the study.RESULTSInitially, nurses had good self-esteem and professional values but were not satisfied with their work. Following the PD, self-esteem and professional values were unaffected; however, nurses expressed increased sense of ownership and greater satisfaction. Nurses were observed to engage in more prevention work. More effective ways of assessing and communicating risk and monitoring nurses' performance of prevention work were created and evaluated. Patients' environments were made safer and more patient-centred.CONCLUSIONManipulation of attitudes and values is not warranted if attitudes and values are good. However, participation in work-related decision-making engages practitioners and leads to greater congruence between values and behaviour. Recommendations include promoting reflection and action to achieve cultural change and person-centred care.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEThis study is relevant to international readership as adds to what is known about nurses' practice behaviours related to falls prevention and will assist others when designing and implementing programs that address patient safety and optimise nurses' adherence.",0,304

Although the effectiveness of a certain number of processes has been experimentally demonstrated, the underlying atomic mechanisms are often not understood. An import class of techniques relies on the interaction between hydrogen and graphene, which is the focus of this research. In particular, the growth of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) is subject to a single-atom-thick interface carbon layer strongly bound to the substrate, which can be detached through hydrogen intercalation. Here we report that a nucleation phenomenon induces the transformation of this buffer layer into graphene. We study the graphenization dynamics by an ab initio based method that permits the simulation of large systems with an atomic resolution, spanning the time scales from nanoseconds to hours. The early evolution stage (∼ms time scale) is characterised by the formation of a metastable H layer deposited on the C surface. H penetration in the interface between the C monolayer and the SiC(0001) surface is a rare event due to the large penetration barrier, which is ∼2 eV. However, at high H densities, energetically favoured Si-H bonding appears on the substrate's surface. The local increase of the H density at the interface due to statistical transitions leads to the graphenization of the overlying C atoms. Thermally activated density fluctuations promote the formation of these graphene-like islands on the buffer layer: this nucleation phenomenon is evidenced by our simulations at a later evolution stage (>10(2) s at 700 °C for ∼3.6 × 10(15) at. cm(-2) s(-1) H flux). Such nuclei grow and quasi-freestanding graphene forms if the exposition to the H flux continues for a sufficiently long time (∼30 min for the same conditions). We have systematically explored this phenomenon by varying the substrate temperature and the H flux, demonstrating that the surface morphology during graphenization and post-graphenization anneals significantly depends on these variables. The computational findings are consistent with the experimental analyses reported so far and could serve as guidelines for future experimental works on graphene manipulation.",0,307

Journal of Clinical Nursing 14(6","AIMS AND BACKGROUNDAdmiral Nurses are specialist dementia care nurses working in the community with carers of those who have a dementia. The aim of the competency project (2000-2003) was threefold. Firstly to work collaboratively with these specialist nurses to facilitate the development a competency framework that reflects the needs of the Admiral Nursing Service. Secondly, to provide a way to structure evidence demonstrating evolving competency. Thirdly, to specifically enable the nurses to demonstrate evidence of achieving the UK Nursing and Midwifery Council's Higher Level Practice standard.DESIGN AND METHODSThe two complementary approaches of emancipatory action research and systematic practice development were adopted. Methods were taken from action research and systematic practice development approaches with an emphasis on promoting and enabling enlightenment, critical reflection, ownership and creating the best conditions for long-term commitment to the competency framework.RESULTSThe main outcome from this project was the development of a specialist nursing competency framework. The Admiral Nurses' Competency Framework is made up of a set of eight core competencies with three levels of competency statements, loosely structured around the Higher Level Practice standard, and guidance documentation to illustrate how work-based evidence can be generated to demonstrate competence. There were also process-derived outcomes associated with combining systematic practice development with emancipatory action research that had an impact on the culture. The main outcomes here were that practitioners engaged in and experienced learning about how to research their own practice and the consequences of doing this. They also learnt about specialist nursing practice more widely than Admiral Nursing. Finally, there was some increase in awareness about the culture within their teams and organizations. The final competency framework reflects the needs of the service, is owned by the majority of practitioners and project commissioners and this has had a positive impact on implementation.CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we report on combining systematic practice development with action research to achieve immediate project aims. In addition we show how a project of this nature can contribute to developing skills in practitioners necessary for cultural changes in practice and contributes to wider issues of modernization within nursing and health care.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEThis competency framework will enable Admiral Nurses to demonstrate their level of specialist practice, as individuals and collectively as a service and it also promotes the principles of nurses as life long learners. This may have relevance to other groups of specialist nurses. The project has widespread relevance for two reasons. Firstly, it shows that nurses can be involved in designing and testing a competency framework as collaborators. Secondly, that to achieve this within the spirit of approaches, such as systematic practice development and action research, can be testing for all collaborators even were there is a shared or espoused aim.",0,309

Retinal cases & brief reports 11(4","PURPOSETo demonstrate unusual retinal findings in a patient with progressive renal failure due to idiopathic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposition disease, using multimodal imaging.METHODSObservational case report of a 43-year-old white man with renal failure due to light chain deposition disease. His course over 6 years was documented with multimodal imaging including fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Additional evaluations included ocular ultrasound, electroretinography, positron emission tomography, serum protein electrophoreses, skeletal surveys to detect osteolytic lesions, and renal, liver, and rectal biopsies in search of amyloid.RESULTSThe patient's ocular course mirrored the severity of his renal dysfunction for which he required a renal transplant. Changes observed in the native kidney recurred in the transplant 2 years later, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry, revealing thick linear deposits of kappa chains, with no complement, overlying the glomerular basement membrane. The systemic workup was negative for amyloid but showed an overwhelming ratio of kappa to lambda light chains on serum protein electrophoreses and no clinical signs of plasma cell dyscrasias, all consistent with idiopathic light chain deposition disease. The patient presented with a generalized, bilateral ""leopard-spot"" fundus appearance on fundus autofluorescence, striking globular subretinal deposits on spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and subfoveal subretinal fluid without retinal pigment epithelium detachment or choroidal effusions. The subfoveal fluid did not respond to intravitreal injections of antiangiogenic agents or steroids but resolved after renal transplantation. A temporary posttransplant visual improvement was associated with lessening of the subretinal drusenoid deposits demonstrated by multimodal imaging. The terminal vision deterioration was associated with amorphous, vitelliform-like material deposition and atrophic changes.CONCLUSIONThis case may illustrate a resemblance in the renal glomerulus basement membrane and retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch membrane complex, because the authors observed deposits of excess monoclonal kappa chains manifesting as extracellular, proteinaceous aggregates on the basement membrane of the glomerulus, and striking, globular subretinal deposits that overlay a thickened retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch membrane complex. The ocular lesions' refractoriness to intravitreal treatments could be attributed to the fact that they represent proteinaceous aggregates similar to those documented in the glomeruli. This is the first report of generalized, large, subretinal drusenoid deposits and their course, as documented through multimodal imaging, paralleling the chronology of systemic changes in a patient with light chain deposition disease.",0,310

Bacterial cultures and 2-day-old biofilm of H. pylori ATCC 43629 were exposed to ELF-EMF (50 Hz frequency-1 mT intensity) for 2 days to assess their effect on the cell adhesion and on the mature biofilm detachment, respectively. All the exposed cultures and the respective sham exposed controls were studied for: the cell viability status, the cell morphological analysis, the biofilm mass measurement, the genotypic profile, and the luxS and amiA gene expression. The ELF-EMF acted on the bacterial population during the biofilm formation displaying significant differences in cell viability, as well as, in morphotypes measured by the prevalence of spiral forms (58.41%) in respect to the controls (33.14%), whereas, on mature biofilm, no significant differences were found when compared to the controls. The measurement of biofilm cell mass was significantly reduced in exposed cultures in both examined experimental conditions. No changes in DNA patterns were recorded, whereas a modulation in amiA gene expression was detected. An exposure to ELF-EMF of H. pylori biofilm induces phenotypic changes on adhering bacteria and decreases the cell adhesion unbalancing the bacterial population therefore reducing the H. pylori capability to protect itself.",0,311

Nuclear imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) are ideal and noninvasive tools to investigate the biodistribution and biological fate of the nanostructures, but the incorporation of a positron emitter is required. Here we describe a novel approach for the (18)F-radiolabeling of polyester-based nanoparticles. Our approach relies on the preparation of the radiolabeled active agent 4-[(18)F]fluorobenzyl-2-bromoacetamide ([(18)F]FBBA), which is subsequently coupled to block copolymers under mild conditions. The labeled block copolymers are ultimately incorporated as constituent elements of the NPs by using a modified nano coprecipitation method. This strategy has been applied in the current work to the preparation of peptide-functionalized NPs with potential applications in drug delivery. According to the measurements of particle size and zeta potential, the radiolabeling process did not result in a statistically significant alteration of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. Moreover, radiochemical stability studies showed no detachment of the radioactivity from NPs even at 12 h after preparation. The radiolabeled NPs enabled the in vivo quantification of the biodistribution data in rats using a combination of imaging techniques, namely, PET and computerized tomography (CT). Low accumulation of the nanoparticles in the liver and their elimination mainly via urine was found. The different biodistribution pattern obtained for the ""free"" radiolabeled polymer suggests chemical and radiochemical integrity of the NPs under investigation. The strategy reported here may be applied to any polymeric NPs containing polymers bearing a nucleophile, and hence our novel strategy may find application for the in vivo and noninvasive investigation of a wide range of NPs.",0,312

In this work, we report a simple, ultrasensitive, label-free, and high-throughput solution immersed silicon (SIS) immunosensor based on non-reflection condition (NRC) for p-polarized wave for early diagnosis of MI. SIS sensor chips are just a thin dielectric polymer layer on the silicon surface, which can be functionalized for specific application. At NRC, SIS sensors are extremely sensitive to the growing thickness of a bio-layer on the sensor surface while independent of refractive index change of the surrounding medium. Therefore, SIS signal is free from thermal noise, unlike surface plasmon resonance based sensor. Also, there is no need of reference signal which facilitates fast and accurate interaction measurement. Here, SIS technology is applied to tackle two issues in MI diagnosis: high sensitivity with the direct assay and the ability to measure in human serum. Myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) proteins were used as the MI biomarkers. We were able to measure over a broad concentration range with the detection limit of 5 and 10pg/ml for cTnI in PBS and blood serum, respectively. The response time is about 5min.

Our previous work indicated these three variables effectively describe and predict separation efficiency for drift tube ion mobility spectrometry experiments. In this work, we seek to determine if our previous findings are a general reflection of IM behavior that can be applied to various instrument platforms and mobility techniques. Results suggest IM distributions are well characterized by a Gaussian model and separation efficiency can be predicted on the basis of the empirical difference in the gas-phase CCS and a CCS-based resolving power definition (CCS/ΔCCS). Notably traveling wave (TWIMS) was found to operate at resolutions substantially higher than a single-peak resolving power suggested. When a CCS-based Rp definition was utilized, TWIMS was found to operate at a resolving power between 40 and 50, confirming the previous observations by Giles and co-workers. After the separation axis (and corresponding resolving power) is converted to cross section space, it is possible to effectively predict separation behavior for all mobility techniques evaluated (i.e., uniform field, trapped ion mobility, traveling wave, cyclic, and overtone instruments) using the equations described in this work.

However, relatively little work has been done on optical computed tomography (OCT). This paper describes a new OCT scanner based on a broad beam light source and a two-dimensional charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. A number of key design features are discussed including the light source; the scanning tank, turntable and stepper motor control; the diffuser screen onto which images are projected and the detector. It is shown that the non-uniform pixel sensitivity of the low-cost CCD detector used and the granularity of the diffuser screen lead to a serious ring artefact in the reconstructed images. Methods are described for eliminating this. The problems arising from reflection and refraction at the walls of the gel container are explained. Optical ray-tracing simulations are presented for cylindrical containers with a variety of radii and verified experimentally. Small changes in the model parameters lead to large variations in the signal intensity observed in the projection data. The effect of imperfect containers on data quality is discussed and a method based on a 'correction scan' is shown to be successful in correcting many of the related image artefacts. The results of two tomography experiments are presented. In the first experiment, a radiochromic Fricke gel sample was exposed four times in different positions to a 100 kVp x-ray beam perpendicular to the plane of imaging. Images of absorbed dose with slice thickness of 140 microm were acquired. with 'true' in-plane resolution of 560 x 560 microm2 at the edge of the 72 mm field of view and correspondingly higher resolution at the centre.

It contains a wealth of very important results concerning the relationship between a multitude of factors in the prevention and occurrence of torture. However, the results described may be interpreted in a manner different to how it was done in the book. The intention of this paper is to draw attention to some challenges in the research design and to give a broader view of the complexity of torture prevention. The book: The authors have identified a host of preventive factors, organised them in clusters (detention law and practice; prosecution (of torturers) law and practice; complaint law and practice; and, monitoring law and practice), and scored them according to whether they fulfil international standards. A torture score comprising frequency, geographical spread and severity of torture was constructed (CHATS). Ill-treatment was excluded. Correlations between preventive factors, clusters and CHATS were calculated. However, the interrelationship between various factors and clusters was not analysed. The main findings included that detention practice had the strongest (negative) correlation to torture and that the torture scoring, pooled for all countries, declined during the study period (1985-2014).COMMENTFor several reasons, distinguishing 'more severe torture' from 'torture' is problematic. Excluding illtreatment in the research is also problematic because the border between the two may be blurred and difficult to interpret and it may be manipulated by authorities, leading to falsely low torture incidence. The pooling of data of diverse quality may hide outstanding prevention results. Identification and implementation of best practices is recommended. Preventive means implemented with low quality may give legitimacy to practices in torturing detentions. The quality of preventive actions is key to efficiency. Factors and clusters of preventive means interact in synergy making each other fully effective. A new model for torture prevention is proposed, which emphasises that all preventive means interact together with transparency, lack of corruption and reprisals, forming the practices in detention where torture takes place. The political will to prevent torture is a key factor.",0,321

Although our ability to characterize the transport behaviors of multiple-motor systems has improved substantially, many aspects of multiple-motor dynamics are poorly understood. This work describes a transition rate model that predicts the load-dependent transport behaviors of multiple-motor complexes from detailed measurements of a single motor's elastic and mechanochemical properties. Transition rates are parameterized via analyses of single-motor stepping behaviors, load-rate-dependent motor-filament detachment kinetics, and strain-induced stiffening of motor-cargo linkages. The model reproduces key signatures found in optical trapping studies of structurally defined complexes composed of two kinesin motors, and predicts that multiple kinesins generally have difficulties in cooperating together. Although such behavior is influenced by the spatiotemporal dependence of the applied load, it appears to be directly linked to the efficiency of kinesin's stepping mechanism, and other types of less efficient and weaker processive motors are predicted to cooperate more productively. Thus, the mechanochemical efficiencies of different motor types may determine how effectively they cooperate together, and hence how motor copy number contributes to the regulation of cargo motion.",0,322

ASM tissues were dissected from excised pig tracheas and stimulated by a chemical stimulus (acetylcholine, 10(-3) M) to produce maximum contractions. The tissues were then systematically excited with external oscillations. Various frequencies, amplitudes and durations were used in the experiments to determine stiffness changes in response to these variations. Force changes were recorded to reflect the muscle stiffness changes. Two stiffness definitions were used to quantify the results, dynamic stiffness to reflect variations during oscillation and static stiffness to reflect the net effect of oscillation. Under isometric contractions, these two stiffnesses were determined before, during and after oscillations. Incorporating an empirical stiffness equation, a two-dimensional finite element model (FEM) was developed to generalize the tissue responses to oscillation. The main outcomes from this work are: the dynamic stiffness has the tendency to decrease as the frequency and/or amplitude of external oscillation increases; the static stiffness has the tendency of decreasing with an increase in the frequency and/or amplitude of excitation until it reaches almost a constant value for frequencies at and above 25 Hz. The difference in the behavior of the dynamic and static stiffness changes may be attributed to the effect of elasticity and mass inertia that are involved in the dynamic motion. The findings of this research are in agreement with the hypothesis that oscillations exert a direct action on the contractile processes by causing an increased rate of actin-myosin detachments.",0,324

By this method, we have shown that there is a central angle, i.e., the isobaric point, independent of blood vessel diameter. The vessel diameter changes the effective reduced scattering coefficient. However, both the scattering profile and the value of the isobaric point strongly depend on optical properties and the exact geometry of the tissue. In this study, we investigate the dependency of the isobaric point on tissue diameter and scattering coefficient in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations. We show that the value of this point linearly depends on tissue diameter. The findings of this work solve the dilemma of whether to measure transmission or reflection since the isobaric point reduces by half the total amount of exiting photons.

Unfortunately, computational cost has limited most of those previous endeavors to ESI droplets with radii of ∼3 nm or less, which represent the low end of the size distribution in the ESI plume. The current work extends this range by conducting simulations on aqueous ESI droplets with radii of 5.5 nm (∼23 000 water molecules). Considering that computational cost increases with r6, this is a significant step forward. We focused on the ESI process for polypropylene glycol (PPG) which is a common ESI-MS calibrant. Different chain lengths (PPG10, 30, and 60) were tested in droplets that were charged with excess Na+. Solvent evaporation and Na+ ejection, with occasional progeny droplet formation, kept the systems at 80-100% of the Rayleigh limit throughout their life cycle. PPG chains migrated to the droplet surface where they captured Na+ via binding to ether oxygens. Various possible pathways for PPG release into the gas phase were encountered. Some PPG10 runs showed ejection from the droplet surface, consistent with the ion evaporation model (IEM). In other instances, PPG was released after near-complete solvent evaporation, as envisioned by the charged residue model (CRM). A third avenue was the partial separation from the droplet to form double or single-tailed structures, with subsequent chain detachment from the droplet. This last pathway is consistent with the chain ejection model (CEM). Immediately after detachment many chains were electrostatically stretched, but they subsequently collapsed into compact conformers. Extended structures were retained only for the most highly charged ions. Our simulations were complemented by ESI-MS and ion mobility measurements. MD-predicted charge states and collision cross sections were in agreement with these experimental data, supporting the mechanistic insights obtained.",0,328

The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that embitterment is positively correlated with rumination, and that this effect is influenced by positive beliefs about rumination. METHOD: A convenience sample (N = 79) of staff of a health care facility attending its occupational health service completed questionnaires assessing chronic embitterment, work-related rumination (distinguishing affective rumination and problem solving pondering), positive beliefs about rumination, and depression. RESULTS: Embitterment scores correlated positively with affective rumination and depression. Positive beliefs about rumination correlated positively with problem-solving pondering but not with affective rumination. Regression analysis revealed that affective rumination contributed to embitterment independently of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has demonstrated that rumination impairs executive functions and problem-solving. The association of affective rumination with embitterment may contribute to the explanation for why embitterment becomes chronic and is often difficult to alleviate. However, this association also opens up possibilities of intervention, in light of research evidence of the effectiveness of rumination-focused therapies. (PsycINFO Database Record",0,329

The diversity of the B cell population as a whole decreases with age, and is associated with ill health.

The Journal of experimental biology 209: 3873-3881.","Amphiura filiformis is a burrowing brittlestar, which extends arms in the water column when suspension feeding. In previous studies, unexpectedly high variability was observed in regeneration rate between individuals even when experiments were performed under identical conditions. The aims of this work were to understand this variability and interpret the observed variability in terms of adaptation to sublethal predation. Our experiments on the dynamics of arm regeneration in A. filiformis revealed that the developmental program during regeneration is well adapted to its burrowing life style. We demonstrate that there is a trade-off between regeneration in length and functional recovery for feeding (differentiation index). The amount of tissue lost (length lost), which represents the quantity of tissue needed to completely regenerate an intact arm with no previous history of regeneration, determines whether the arm will invest more energy in growth and/or in differentiation, which must be a reflection of the ability to differentially regulate developmental programs during regeneration. We show that combining regeneration rate with differentiation index provides an ideal tool for the definition of a standard temporal framework for both field and laboratory studies of regeneration.",0,331

The intact bursal side of the cuff was not detached, and all associated pathology was treated. Fifty patients available for follow-up were evaluated with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) questionnaire.RESULTSAmerican Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from a mean of 48.0 to 89.4 (+41.4) (P < .0001). Pain scores on a visual analog scale improved from 5.7 to 1.0 (P < .0001). Ninety-eight percent of patients were satisfied with the results of surgery. Results for the 50 patients available for follow-up were excellent in 32 (64%), good in 6 (12%), fair in 6 (12%), and poor in 6 (12%). Articular-sided rotator cuff tears rarely occurred in isolation but were typically found in association with coexisting pathology suggestive of the tears' etiology. Most common were impingement lesions, seen in 94% of patients, and instability lesions such as labral tears, seen in 30% of patients. Associated procedures included acromioplasty in 47, distal clavicle resection in 29, treatment of biceps pathology in 7, and instability repair in 15. One patient sustained a postoperative pulmonary embolism, which represented the only complication. Tears varied in size from 50% to 90% of the thickness of the cuff insertion. Significant differences were identified in the results of Workers' Compensation patients. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance arthrography were accurate in identifying a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear in less than 40% of cases.CONCLUSIONSArthroscopic transtendinous repair of partial articular-sided rotator cuff tears is a safe and effective treatment that allows identification of commonly associated pathology and reliable improvement in pain and function.LEVEL OF EVIDENCELevel IV, therapeutic case series.",0,332

Given the disproportionately high number of Indigenous people imprisoned in colonized countries, this paper responds to research from Western Australia on the need to prepare forensic mental health nurses to deliver care to Indigenous patients with mental health disorders. The paper highlights the nexus between theory, research and education that can inform the design and implementation of programmes to help nurses navigate the complex, layered and contested 'intercultural space' and deliver culturally safe care to Indigenous patients. Nurses are encouraged to critically reflect on how beliefs and values underpinning their cultural positioning impact on health care to Indigenous patients. The paper draws on intercultural theory to offer a pedagogical framework that acknowledges the negative impacts of colonization on Indigenous health and well-being, repositions and revalues Indigenous cultures and knowledges and fosters open and robust inquiry. This approach is seen as a step towards working more effectively in the intercultural space where ultimately binary oppositions that privilege one culture over another and inhibit robust inquiry are avoided, paving the way for new, more inclusive positions, representations and understandings to emerge.

Cryopreservation of tissues depends on the presence of cryoprotectants, their addition and removal, and exposure to conditions during freezing and thawing, all of which depend on cellular membrane permeabilities to water and cryoprotectant. This study defines the permeability properties that define the rate of water and cryoprotectant movement across the plasma membrane of isolated human corneal endothelial, keratocyte, and epithelial cells. Cells were transferred from isotonic conditions (300 mosm/kg) to 0.5, 1, or 2 M dimethyl sulfoxide and propylene glycol solutions at constant temperature, and cell volumes monitored using an electronic particle counter. Histograms describing cell volume changes over time after cryoprotectant exposure allowed calculation of hydraulic conductivity (Lp), cryoprotectant permeability (Ps), and the reflection coefficient (sigma). Experimental values for Lp and Ps at 4, 13, 22, and 37 degrees C were used to determine the Arrhenius activation energy (Ea). Defining the permeability parameters and temperature dependencies allows simulation of responses of human corneal cells to addition and removal of cryoprotectants and to freezing conditions, allowing amount of supercooling, intracellular electrolyte concentration, and intracellular cryoprotectant concentration to be calculated. Simulations also show that the constituent cells in the bioengineered cornea respond differently to addition and removal of cryoprotectants and to freezing.

NPCs behavior is dependent upon the phenomenon of frustrated total internal reflection.

A state space modeling approach is used to derive the transfer functions and analyze the stability of these filters. The ability of adapting using the gains is demonstrated. Our simulation results indicate that the characteristic bandpass and notch filter responses of each structure are the basis of channelizer architectures, and optical gain may be used to adjust filter parameters to obtain a desired frequency magnitude response, especially in the range of 1-5 GHz for the chip with a coupler separation of ∼9 mm. Preliminarily, the measurement of spectral response shows enhancement of quality factor by using higher optical gains.

It is argued that the processes of molecular biochemistry alone cannot explain how a developing organism defies a stochastic universe. The demonstration of current flow (charge transfer) along the long axis of DNA through the base-pairs (the ""pi-way) in vitro raises the question of whether nature may employ such current flows for biological purposes. Such currents might be too small to be accessible to direct measurement in vivo but conduction has been measured in vitro, and the methods might well be extended to living systems. This has not been done because there is no reasonable model which could stimulate experimentation. We suggest several related, but detachable or independent, models for the biological utility of charge transfer, whose scope admittedly outruns current concepts of thinking about organization, growth, and development in eukaryotic, metazoan systems. The ideas are related to explanations proposed to explain the effects demonstrated on tumors and normal tissues described in Article I (this issue). Microscopic and mesoscopic potential fields and currents are well known at sub-cellular, cellular, and organ systems levels. Not only are such phenomena associated with internal cellular membranes in bioenergetics and information flow, but remarkable long-range fields over tissue interfaces and organs appear to play a role in embryonic development (Nuccitelli, 1992 ).

There is some knowledge about situations that are experienced as problematic, whereas less is understood about how physicians respond to the problems they face. One way to acquire such knowledge is to consider ""reflection-in-action"", aspects of which are expressed in the physician's interpretation of the patient's story. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge about the meaning content of case reports about problematic sickness certification. Specifically, we looked for possible messages to the colleagues intended to read the reports.METHODSA narrative approach was used to analyse reports about problematic sickness certification cases that had been written by GPs and occupational health service physicians as part of a sickness insurance course. The analysis included elements from both thematic and structural analysis. Nineteen case reports were used in the actual analysis and 25 in the validation of the results. Main narrative qualities and structural features of the written case reports were explored.RESULTSFive types of messages were identified in the case reports, here classified as ""a call for help"", ""a call for understanding"", ""hidden worries"", ""in my opinion"", and ""appearing neutral"". In the reports, the physicians tried to achieve neutrality in their writing, and the patients' stories tended to be interpreted within a traditional biomedical framework. In some cases there was an open request for help, in others it was not obvious that the physician had any problems. Overall, the messages were about having problems as such, rather than the specific features of the problems.CONCLUSIONSThe case reports clearly demonstrated different ways of writing about problems that arise during sickness certification, from being neutral and not mentioning the problems to being emotionally involved and asking for help. The general character of the messages suggests that they are also relevant for case reports in problematic areas other than sickness certification. If pertinent relationships can be found between reflection-in-practice and the narrative writing about practice, they will provide an approach to further research concerning consultations perceived as problematic and also to medical education.",0,344

According to the theory, such special features should be observed experimentally if the mitochondrial phosphorylating system operated in the state of a supercomplex. It was proved that the phosphorylating system is able to operate in two states: P. Mitchell state and R. Williams state. It was demonstrated that in the ATP synthesis reaction, ATP-synthase (F1F0) was able to use thermodynamic potential of Bronsted acids as a source of energy.

Families often feel neglected and that their problems and needs are underestimated, if they do not personally draw attention to this fact.METHODSA phenomenological hermeneutic method, inspired by the philosophy of Ricoeur, was used when interpreting the interview text.RESULTSThe experiences of spouses living with a chronically ill partner often brought a feeling of detachment from their partner's lives. The women experienced changes in their relationships because of their partners' disabilities; they had emotions of loneliness, despite living together as a couple.

Biophysical journal 106(1","Understanding mechanosensitivity (i.e., how cells sense the stiffness of their environment) is very important, yet there is a fundamental difficulty in understanding its mechanism: to measure an elastic modulus one requires two points of application of force-a measuring and a reference point. The cell in contact with substrate has only one (adhesion) point to work with, and thus a new method of measurement needs to be invented. The aim of this theoretical work is to develop a self-consistent physical model for mechanosensitivity, a process by which a cell detects the mechanical stiffness of its environment (e.g., a substrate it is attached to via adhesion points) and generates an appropriate chemical signaling to remodel itself in response to this environment. The model uses the molecular mechanosensing complex of latent TGF-β attached to the adhesion point as the biomarker. We show that the underlying Brownian motion in the substrate is the reference element in the measuring process. The model produces a closed expression for the rate of release of active TGF-β, which depends on the substrate stiffness and the pulling force coming from the cell in a subtle and nontrivial way. It is consistent with basic experimental data showing an increase in signal for stiffer substrates and higher pulling forces. In addition, we find that for each cell there is a range of stiffness where a homeostatic configuration of the cell can be achieved, outside of which the cell either relaxes its cytoskeletal forces and detaches from the very weak substrate, or generates an increasingly strong pulling force through stress fibers with a positive feedback loop on very stiff substrates. In this way, the theory offers the underlying mechanism for the myofibroblast conversion in wound healing and smooth muscle cell dysfunction in cardiac disease.",0,347

Several complex mechanisms are suspected to be involved and notably insulin resistance, though the available data are limited. The objective of the present study was to provide further evidence for the effects of shiftwork on glucose and lipid metabolism with a specific focus on insulin resistance. A cross-sectional study has recruited 97 shiftworkers (SWs) (three shifts, 8 h) and 95 strictly day workers (DWs) from the same plant for 2001-2002. Several indices of insulin sensitivity or resistance were calculated, based on formulas of the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), the Revised-Quicki, McAuley and Disse indices. The HOMA-β-cell index was used as a reflection of pancreatic secretion. Characteristics of the occupation, habitual diet and lifestyles were recorded. Logistic regression analysis in which pancreatic function or insulin sensitivity was the dependent variable was used to compare alternative models.RESULTSSWs were characterized as having significantly higher triglycerides and free fatty acids and normal but lower blood glucose. The risk of a high β-cell activity was increased almost three-fold in SWs. By adjusting for many confounding factors, SWs had significantly lower insulin sensitivity according to several indices, whereas HOMA-IR was not meaningfully different between shift and DWs.

While pyrethroid resistance is common in Ae. aegypti worldwide and testing is recommended by CDC and WHO, resistance to this class of products has not been widely examined or quantified in Florida. To address this information gap, we performed the first study to quantify both pyrethroid resistance and genetic markers of pyrethroid resistance in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus strains in Florida. Using direct topical application to measure intrinsic toxicity, we examined 21 Ae. aegypti strains from 9 counties and found permethrin resistance (resistance ratio (RR) = 6-61-fold) in all strains when compared to the susceptible ORL1952 control strain. Permethrin resistance in five strains of Ae. albopictus was very low (RR<1.6) even when collected from the same containers producing resistant Ae. aegypti. Characterization of two sodium channel kdr alleles associated with pyrethroid-resistance showed widespread distribution in 62 strains of Ae. aegypti. The 1534 phenylalanine to cysteine (F1534C) single nucleotide polymorphism SNP was fixed or nearly fixed in all strains regardless of RR.

We have analyzed small angle neutron scattering (SANS) data to determine the conformation of a ""model"" nonionic polymer, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), in aqueous solutions as affected by the presence of an ionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and subsequent addition of short-chain alcohol (ethanol or 2-propanol). PEO chains (MW = 90,000) are Gaussian in dilute aqueous solutions, but become polyelectrolyte-like upon the addition of 30 mM SDS, with about 6 SDS micelles bound to each PEO chain. Micelles associated with polymer are similar in structure and interactions to micelles that form in aqueous solutions in the absence of polymer. Addition of alcohol alters both the polymer and micelle structure and interactions, leads to detachment of micelles from the polymer, and the PEO chains regain their Gaussian conformation. 2-Propanol is more effective than ethanol in influencing the polymer conformation and the properties of SDS micelles in aqueous solutions, either in the presence or in the absence of PEO. This study contributes fundamental insights on polymer and surfactant organization in solution, as well as new, quantitative information on systems that are widely used in practice.",0,352

Dent Mater 34(1","OBJECTIVE: Denture adhesives are widely used to avoid the detachment and sliding of dentures. However, the adhesion properties can be affected by variation in mouth conditions such as the level of salivation. The objective of this study was to understand the effect of environmental conditions on the adhesion properties of a commercially available denture adhesive named as Poligrip((R)) Free manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Ltd., UK and to identify the reasons for the observed variation in its adhesion strength. METHODS: The failure mechanisms of denture adhesive have been assessed through using different physical, mechanical and thermal characterization experiments. All methods were used in different pH, temperatures, and salivation conditions and at the end, a strategy was proposed to overcome the failure of the paste in hyposalivation as well. RESULTS: In vitro models mimicking the denture gingival interface were designed to evaluate the adhesion properties of the investigated adhesive. Changes in the adhesion strength in response to three major factors related to the oral conditions including level of salivation, pH, and temperature were measured. The results of lap shear, tensile test, and internal interactions suggested a cohesion failure, where the lowest adhesion strength was due to hyposalivation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and rheological analysis confirmed the importance of hydrogen bonds and hydration in the adhesion strength of the paste. SIGNIFICANCE: The investigated scenarios are widely observed in patient using denture adhesives and the clinical reports have indicated the inconsistency in adhesion strength of the commercial products. After identifying the potential reasons for such behavior, methods such as the addition of tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TPME) to enhance internal hydrogen bonds between the polymers are proposed to improve adhesion in the hyposalivation scenario.",0,353

Nanoscale 8(16","A method combining liquid-liquid phase separation and the pyrolysis process has been developed to fabricate the wormhole-like porous carbon/magnetic nanoparticles composite with a pore size of about 80 nm (WPC/MNPs-80). In this work, the porous structure was designed to enhance interaction between the electromagnetic (EM) wave and the absorber, while the magnetic nanoparticles were used to bring about magnetic loss ability. The structure, morphology, porosity and magnetic properties of WPC/MNPs-80 were investigated in detail. To evaluate its EM wave attenuation performance, the EM parameters of the absorber and wax composite were measured at 2-18 GHz. WPC/MNPs-80 has an excellent EM wave absorbency with a wide absorption band at a relatively low loading and thin absorber thickness. At the absorber thickness of 1.5 and 2.0 mm, minimum RL values of -29.2 and -47.9 dB were achieved with the RL below -10 dB in 12.8-18 and 9.2-13.3 GHz, respectively. The Co and Fe nanoparticles derived from the chemical reduction of Co0.2Fe2.8O4 can enhance the graphitization process of carbon and thus improve dielectric loss ability. Polarizations in the nanocomposite absorber also play an important role in EM wave absorption. Thus, EM waves can be effectively attenuated by dielectric loss and magnetic loss through multiple reflections and absorption in the porous structure. WPC/MNPs-80 could be an excellent absorber for EM wave attenuation; and the design strategy could be extended as a general method to synthesize other high-performance absorbers.",0,354

Journal of biophotonics 9(10","Optical methods for detecting physiological state based on light-tissue interaction are noninvasive, inexpensive, simplistic, and thus very useful. The blood vessels in human tissue are the main cause of light absorbing and scattering. Therefore, the effect of blood vessels on light-tissue interactions is essential for optically detecting physiological tissue state, such as oxygen saturation, blood perfusion and blood pressure. We have previously suggested a new theoretical and experimental method for measuring the full scattering profile, which is the angular distribution of light intensity, of cylindrical tissues. In this work we will present experimental measurements of the full scattering profile of heterogenic cylindrical phantoms that include blood vessels. We show, for the first time that the vessel diameter influences the full scattering profile, and found higher reflection intensity for larger vessel diameters accordance to the shielding effect. For an increase of 60% in the vessel diameter the light intensity in the full scattering profile above 90° is between 9% to 40% higher, depending on the angle. By these results we claim that during respiration, when the blood-vessel diameter changes, it is essential to consider the blood-vessel diameter distribution in order to determine the optical path in tissues.

The Journal of experimental biology 209: 2611-2621.","Many arthropods and vertebrates possess tarsal adhesive pads densely covered with setae. The striking morphological convergence of ;hairy' pads in lizards, spiders and several insect orders demonstrates the advantage of this design for substrate adhesion. Early functional explanations of hairy adhesive organs focused on the performance on rough substrates, where flexible setae can make more intimate contact. Recent theoretical and experimental work shows that the hairy design can also help to achieve self-cleaning properties, controllable detachment and increased adhesion. Several arguments have been proposed to explain why adhesive forces are maximised. First, the ;Force scaling' hypothesis states that when adhesive forces scale linearly with the dimensions of the contact, adhesion is increased by dividing the contact zone into many microscopic subunits. Second, the ;Fracture mechanics' argument implies that adhesion is maximised when the size of adhesive contacts is smaller than the critical crack length. Third, the ;Work of adhesion' model suggests that adhesion increases due to the bending and stretching of setae and associated energy losses during detachment. Several morphological traits of hairy adhesive pads can be explained by the need to maximise the work of adhesion, while avoiding the sticking of setae to each other (self-matting). Firstly, if setae are oblique and convex toward the foot tip as typical of most hairy pads, arrays should achieve greater adhesion. Secondly, a branched seta morphology not only confers the advantage that setae can adapt to roughness at different length scales but also prevents self-matting and increases the work of adhesion. It is predicted from the ;Work of adhesion' model that adhesion of pads with unbranched setae cannot be increased by subdividing the contact zone into ever finer subcontacts, because this would increasingly cause self-matting. However, contact splitting can increase adhesion if setae are branched. The greater density of setae in large animals has been interpreted by ;Force scaling'. However, the existing data can be explained by the effect of seta branching and by a fundamental difference between ;wet' and ;dry' adhesive systems. As insects employ adhesive fluids, they can cope with small-scale surface roughness even with relatively blunt seta tips, whereas the dry systems of lizards and spiders require extremely fine endings.",0,356

Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA 28(3","This short report presents one strand of the findings from a comprehensive synthesis review of the available evidence on household waste prevention. The aim here is to reflect on evidence regarding the decoupling of economic growth and negative environmental impacts, as well as existing work on modelling and forecasting household waste prevention. Decoupling was found to be a contested term, both conceptually and in terms of practical application, and evidence that it can be achieved was often weak or ambiguous. Modelling, as a tool to explain current waste prevention behaviours, was found to suffer from weaknesses in understanding complex human behaviours and lack of data, and key studies were only able to explain around 30% of observed changes in waste prevention behaviour. Existing models and forecasts of the future growth of waste were therefore found to be largely speculative. These reflections have provided a number of insights for progressing household waste prevention, including the need for a mix of hard (i.e. fiscal, regulatory and service provision) and soft (i.e. behaviour change) measures, though environmental, behavioural, economic and political barriers are also recognized. Among the conclusions is that decoupling as a concept has limited value in terms of developing specific interventions, while recommendations relevant to policy makers and local authorities include the need for further data accumulation and conceptual work to improve modelling and forecasting.",0,358

Methods: Herein, we introduce a facile and effective lab-on-a-chip method of fNRBCs detection using a capture-releasing material that is composed of biotin-doped polypyrrole nanoparticles. To enhance local topographic interactions between the nano-components and fNRBC, a specific antibody, CD147, coated on the nanostructured substrate led to the isolation of fNRBCs from maternal peripheral blood. Subsequently, an electrical system was employed to release the captured cells using 0.8 V for 15 s. The diagnostic application of fNRBCs for fetal chromosomal disorders (Trisomy 13/21/18/X syndrome, microdeletion syndrome) was demonstrated. Results: Cells captured by nanostructured microchips were identified as fNRBCs.

Research suggests, that a selective attention for negative information contributes to development and maintenance of depression and that reducing this negative bias might be of therapeutic value.

Methods/design: This study presents a double-blind randomized controlled trial in two parallel groups with follow-ups at 1, 6, and 12 months, combined with an economic evaluation. One hundred twenty six patients, diagnosed with MDD, who are registered for specialized outpatient services at a mental health care organization in the Netherlands, are randomized into either a positive training (towards positive and away from negative stimuli) or a sham training, as control condition (continuous attentional bias assessment). Patients complete eight training sessions (seven at home) during a period of two weeks (four weekly sessions). Primary outcome measures are change in attentional bias (pre- to post-test), mood response to stress (at post-test) and long-term effects on depressive symptoms (up to 1-year follow-up). Secondary outcome measures include rumination, resilience, positive and negative affect, and transfer to other cognitive measures (i.e., attentional bias for verbal stimuli, cognitive control, positive mental imagery), as well as quality of life and costs.

In this work, we report evidence that the Rho-dependent cell spreading activated by a protein toxin from E. coli, the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), is capable of hindering apoptosis in HEp-2 cells. In addition to the promotion of cell spreading, CNF1 protects cells from the experimentally-induced rounding up and detachment and improves the ability of cells to adhere to each other and to the extracellular matrix by modulating the expression of proteins related to cell adhesion. In particular, the expression of integrins such as alpha 5, alpha 6 and alpha v, as well as of some heterotypic and homotypic adhesion-related proteins such as the Focal Adhesion Kinase, E-cadherin, alpha and beta catenins were significantly increased in cells exposed to CNF1. Our results suggest, however, that the promotion of Rho-dependent cell spreading is the key mechanism in protecting cells against apoptosis rather than cell adhesion per se. A toxin inducing cell spreading without activating Rho, such as Cytochalasin B, was in fact ineffective in favouring cell survival. These data are of relevance (i) for the understanding of the role of the actin-dependent and especially Rho-dependent cellular activities involved in apoptosis regulation and (ii) in providing some clues to understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria, by controlling cell fate, might exert their pathogenic activity.",0,368

This was confirmed in vivo by studying particle adhesion under venous shear profiles in a mouse model of mesenteric inflammation, where MP adhesion was 127% greater (p < 0.0001) for low modulus particles compared to more rigid ones. Mechanistically, we establish that particle collisions with leukocytes drive these trends, rather than differences in particle deformation, localization, or detachment.

Nurse education programmes for student nurses can shape positively the attitudes of individual participants, yet limited research exists on what nursing students' attitudes currently are towards people who are suicidal. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper adds to the developing international comparative work that is providing a greater understanding of cultural perceptions of suicide amongst students. This paper along with existing literature highlights a potential relationship between certain religious belief systems and their potential to be protective against suicide. At the same time, such religious belief is more likely to be associated with more judgmental attitude towards suicidal behaviour. This paper using a validated research tool, devised by a research psychologist, scored for the first time, individual student attitudes towards caring for people that are suicidal, whilst establishing the overall differences between the two countries from which the data are collected. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: This paper offers potential explanations for differences in nursing students' attitudes between the UK and Turkey. Disparities under discussion include gender, type of education, culture and religion. This is an important discussion in the consideration of nurse education worldwide. It is recognized that students may come from a variety of different backgrounds, with varying personal and social attitudes to begin with; yet, there exists the potential to positively influence overall attitudes towards service users whilst learners are still within a training programme, consisting of education and practice experiences. The merits of a specialist mental health nurse training programme and its potential to impact more favourably on students attitudes deserve more attention and research.ABSTRACTIntroduction Suicide is a major public health issue internationally, and the impact of positive or negative attitudes amongst the mental health professional workforce warrants scrutiny. The study aimed to examine English and Turkish nursing students' attitudes towards people with suicidal behaviour. Method This cross-cultural study reports on attitudes of 240 nursing students towards suicide in Turkey and 82 nursing students in the UK. A reliable and valid 24 item ""Attitudes towards Suicide Scale"" and ""Social Reactions to Suicidal Persons Scale"" were used to measure attitudes. Results The UK nursing students were found to display more accepting attitudes to suicide, and scored higher on acceptability of suicide, seeing suicide as a solution and open reporting and discussion of suicide subscales than their Turkish counterparts. Turkish nursing students scored higher on punishment after death and hiding suicidal behaviour subscales than the UK students. Turkish nursing students scored significantly higher on deterring subscale of reactions to a suicidal peer scale than the UK nursing students. Implications for practice It is vital for nurse students to develop positive acceptance of suicide through education, reflection and clinical supervision to be more therapeutic towards suicidal patients.",0,372

The concept under study is detached concern, which refers to nurses' skills to neutralize the emotional appeal of patients by a balanced attitude between objectivity and emotional involvement. The Patient Contact Questionnaire (PCQ) aims at measuring the degree of concern of nurses for their patients. Methods: The PCQ was applied in a pretest–posttest design, evaluating the effects of the Early Recognition Method (ERM). This method aims at the prevention of inpatient violence in forensic psychiatry. Subjects were 116 forensic mental heath nurses working on 16 wards of a large Dutch forensic hospital. First, the baseline scores were compared to scores reported in an earlier study conducted in general psychiatry. Second, pretest–posttest comparisons were carried out for all nurses, and for subgroups of nurses with regard to gender, educational level, years of working experience, and patient population. Third, pretest–posttest comparisons were made on the PCQ item level. Results: The baseline scores of male nurses indicated significantly higher levels of concern than those of female nurses. In addition, more experienced nurses scored significantly higher with regard to concern than less experienced nurses. When comparing the scores before and after applying ERM, no significant differences were found. However, the sores of female nurses showed a tendency toward more concern after implementation of ERM. Conclusions: Detached concern may be a meaningful concept in forensic mental health nursing in measuring nurses' concern for their patients. Levels of detached concern did not change significantly after application of ERM. However, the application of the PCQ could contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between nurses and their patients.

Little is known about the background, experiences and reflections of participants. More information is needed about participants to shape effective lifestyle interventions with lasting effect. This study explores how participants in a lifestyle intervention programme describe previous life experiences in relation to changing lifestyle.METHODSSemi-structured qualitative in-depth interviews were performed with 23 participants (16 women and 7 men) aged 18 - 70 years. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation searching for issues describing participants' responses, and looking for the essence, aiming to share the basis of life-world experiences as valid knowledge.RESULTSParticipants identified two main themes: being stuck in old habits, and being burdened with emotional baggage from their previous negative experiences. Participants expressed a wish to change their lifestyles, but were unable to act in accordance with the health knowledge they possessed. Previous experiences with lifestyle change kept them from initiating attempts without professional assistance. Participants also described being burdened by an emotional baggage with problems from childhood and/or with family, work and social life issues. Respondents said that they felt that emotional baggage was an important explanation for why they were stuck in old habits and that conversely, being stuck in old habits added load to their already emotional baggage and made it heavier.CONCLUSIONSBehavioural change can be hard to perform as psychological distress from life baggage can influence the ability to change. The study participants' experience of being stuck in old habits and having substantial emotional baggage raises questions as to whether or not Healthy Life Centres are able to help participants who need to make a lifestyle change.",0,374

If a visual inspection method is used to find the laser footprint, the task becomes impossible if invisible radiation in the near infrared is employed. In addition, it may be desirable to perform angular scan experiments with a stationary footprint on the surface during scans, or even to automatically probe specific points on an extended prism face for predetermined incidence angles. In this paper, a formulation is developed to determine the required translation along the prism face to allow maintaining the laser footprint stationary under a given rotation.

Resilience programmes are a strengths‐based preventative approach for promoting mental health and well‐being in the face of adversity; however, there is no prior research on mental health nurses' perspectives on resilience programmes. Aim To explore the perspectives of mental health nurses participating in a mental health service‐initiated resilience programme (Promoting Adult Resilience). Method An exploratory qualitative inquiry was undertaken. Multiple qualitative data: open‐ended responses and semi‐structured interviews and focus groups, were thematically analysed. Results Twenty‐nine registered nurses from a metropolitan mental health service participated. Four main themes were as follows: being confronted by adversity; reinforcing understandings of resilience; strengthening resilience; and applying resilience skills at work. Discussion This is the first study to report mental health nurses' perspectives on a resilience programme. Resilience programmes can help improve nurses' self‐efficacy and ability to realistically appraise stressful situations and to moderate their emotional responses to others. Implications for practice It is recommended resilience programmes are provided to promote nurses' well‐being and resilient practices. To build a resilient workforce, the wider barriers and risks to staff well‐being need to be addressed at a unit, organizational and professional level.

The adverse effects of microcystin-LR on morphology and cytoskeletal elements in different stages of early embryonal development have been studied in vitro. Embryos and whole embryo cultures have been exposed to microcystin-LR (10-100 microM). Actin filaments were visualized by fluorescence staining and the microtubular network labelled by immunostaining. Growth, development and cytoskeleton organization of the embryos embedded in zona pellucida are not affected by microcystin-LR in concentrations up to 100 microM, while whole embryo cell cultures are affected by the presence of microcystin-LR in the culture medium. High microcystin-LR concentrations (100 microM) cause cells to be detached and destroyed, while lower concentrations (10-20 microM) profoundly affect actin and microtubule organization. These effects are confirmed also by the presence of transformed microcystin-LR in all the media at the lowest concentrations. It seems that the changes to the cells are far more serious than that expressed in cell morphology. From our experiments we conclude that the presence of zona pellucida is an effective way of embryo protection against xenobiotics like microcystin-LR.",0,379

The proposed system utilizes a laser confocal sensor in both lateral and vertical scanning modes to measure the height of the target features. The roughness parameters are calculated in the developed data processing software according to ISO 4287. To reduce the inherent disadvantage of confocal microscopy, e.g., scattering noise at steep angles and background noise from specular reflection from the optical elements, the developed system has been calibrated and a linear correction factor has been applied in this study. A particular challenge identified for this work is the in-situ measurement of features generated by a robotized surface finishing system. The proposed system was integrated onto a robotic arm with the measuring distance and angle adjusted during measurement based on a CAD model of the component in question.

The aim of the current study was to determine the visual outcomes and prognostic factors of open-globe injuries in the Japanese population. METHODS: Retrospective study of 59 eyes of 59 patients presented with open globe injuries between September 2008 and March 2014 at Nagasaki University Hospital was conducted. Demographic factors including age, gender, and clinical data such as cause of injury, presenting visual acuity (VA), location of injury, type of injury, lens status, presence of intraocular foreign body, types of required surgeries, and final VA were recorded. According to the classification of Ocular Trauma Classification Group, wound location was classified into three zones. Chi-square test was used to compare presented data. RESULTS: Out of the 59 patients, 46 were placed in the Light Perception (LP) group, and 13 were placed in the No Light Perception (NLP) group. Work-related trauma was the most common cause (27 eyes) followed by falls (19eyes). Work-related trauma was common in males (P = 0.004), while falls was significantly common in females (P = 0.00001).

We evaluated these features by using a new platinum coil system.METHODSRight common carotid arterial (CCA) aneurysms were created in 17 rabbits by distal ligation and intraluminal elastase incubation. At least 3 weeks later, aneurysms were packed with detachable platinum coils. Animals were sacrificed at 2 (group 1, n=4), 4 (group 2, n=5), 12 (group 3, n=4), or 24 (group 4, n=4) weeks. Aneurysmal occlusion and coil compaction were angiographically assessed. Histologic features of tissue covering the coils and the aneurysmal dome were assessed and semiquantitatively compared across groups.RESULTSNo notable tracking, deployment, or detachment problems occurred. Volumetric occlusion was 5-49% (mean, 26.8% +/- 11%). Angiographic occlusion was 100% in six cases, 95% in four, and 90% in seven; occlusion scores remained unchanged in 13 cases, decreased in one, and increased in two (one case excluded from angiographic follow-up). Histologic findings were concordant within groups. Group 1 had coverage with thin fibrin layers and scattered leukocytes; group 2, some spindle-cell coverage; group 3, spindle-cell coverage. In groups 1 and 2, dome findings included only unorganized blood products. In group 3, blood products had been replaced with a hypocellular, poorly staining matrix. Some group 4 subjects had variably aged blood products, with tissue of limited organization.CONCLUSIONThe platinum coil system performed well in experimental aneurysmal embolization.

Cytokine 56(3","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) has the highest fatality rate among connective tissue diseases and is characterized by vascular damage, inflammation and fibrosis. Currently, no therapy has proven effective in modifying the course of SSc, a reflection of its complex pathogenesis. T cell-derived cytokines have been implicated in the induction of fibrosis. The role of the pro-fibrotic type 2 cytokine IL-13 and its regulation appear to be important in the pathogenesis of SSc and other fibrotic disorders. Recent work has shown that dysregulated production of IL-13 by effector CD8+ T cells is critical for predisposing patients to more severe forms of cutaneous disease and that this dysregulation is associated with defects in the molecular control of IL-13 production, such as increased expression of the transcription factor GATA-3. Silencing of GATA-3 with siRNA significantly reduces IL-13 production by CD8+ T cells from patients. We review these new insights into SSc pathogenesis that will enable establishment of highly relevant biomarkers of immune dysfunction in patients predisposed to develop SSc and open new possibilities for development of more specific diagnosis and treatment.",0,387

In this work, we found that the AuNPs on the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode could catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of TPA, greatly enhancing the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)3(2+)/TPA, present in the solution. If physical separation of AuNPs away from electrode surface after hybridization with target ssDNA, ECL signal decreased dramatically due to the loss of electrochemical activity of AuNPs, based on which a sensitive and specific DNA sensor in a ""switch-off"" mode was constructed with a detection limit of 0.2pM. In addition, a suppressing effect of the AuNPs on the ECL of Ru(bpy)3(2+) was experimentally confirmed by decreasing the electrocatalytic effect to overall ECL emission, including selection of oxalate as a coreactant instead of TPA, or introduction of gold electrode as substrate. Furthermore, when Ru(bpy)3(2+) and AuNPs were both immobilized on the ITO electrode at close proximity, the ECL quenching induced by energy/electron transfer was predominant. ECL emission of the Ru(bpy)3(2+)/TPA system resulted from a competition between electrocatalytic enhancement and quenching effect. However, the quenched ECL signal would return in case of the AuNPs moving far away from ECL emitters after a hybridization reaction as before, and a separation distance dependent surface enhancement was observed as well. Based on the role change for AuNPs from quenching to enhancing ECL intensity of Ru(bpy)3(2+)/TPA system, a novel ECL DNA sensing strategy in a ""turn-on"" mode was developed, enabling quantitative analysis of target ssDNA over the range of 0.05pM to 0.5nM with a detection limit of 12fM. Overall, we demonstrated the existence of three effects of AuNPs on the ECL of Ru(bpy)3(2+)/TPA system, and which played the leading role was dependent on the placement of AuNPs, Ru(bpy)3(2+), and their separation distance. The ECL sensors based on the role change for AuNPs showed both high sensitivity and excellent selectivity.",0,389

We compared the efficiency of several preprocessing methods with series of spectra containing typical perturbations (baseline shift, scaling factor, and noise) and a priori known definite spectral difference. Several baseline-correction and normalization possibilities were evaluated. Our results were generally sensitive, selective, and robust with respect to baseline and scaling. Full-range scaling generated more false-positive results. Use of first- and second-derivative spectra was tested. Results obtained on model spectra were confirmed with series of spectra from sensitive and multidrug-resistant leukemia K562 cells.

Equine practice 14(1","The large metabolic heat load generated as a consequence of muscular work requires activation of thermoregulatory mechanisms in order to prevent an excessive and potentially dangerous rise in body temperature during exercise. Although the horse has highly efficient heat dissipatory mechanisms, there are a number of circumstances in which the thermoregulatory system may be overwhelmed, resulting in the development of critical hyperthermia. The risk for development of life-threatening hyperthermia is greatest when (1) the horse is inadequately conditioned for the required level of physical performance; (2) exercise is undertaken in hot and particularly, in hot and humid ambient conditions; and (3) there is an impairment to thermoregulatory mechanisms (e.g., severe dehydration, anhidrosis). Both exercise training under cool to moderate ambient conditions and a period of repeated exposure to, and exercise in, hot ambient conditions (heat acclimation) will result in a number of physiologic adaptations conferring improved thermoregulatory ability. These adaptations include an expanded plasma volume, greater stability of cardiovascular function during exercise, and an improved efficiency of evaporative heat loss as a result of alterations in the sweating response. Collectively, these adjustments serve to attenuate the rise in core body temperature in response to a given intensity of exercise. The magnitude of the physiologic adaptations occurring during exercise training and heat acclimation is a reflection of the thermal load imposed on the horse. Therefore, when compared with a period of training in cool conditions, the larger thermal stimulus associated with repeated exercise in hot ambient conditions will invoke proportionally greater thermoregulatory adaptations. Although it is not possible to eliminate the effects of adverse environmental conditions on exercise performance, it is clear that a thorough exercise training program together with a subsequent period of acclimatization will serve to ameliorate the impact of the environment. Based on our current understanding of the nature and extent of thermoregulatory adaptations in the horse, the following conclusions can be made: 1. A 2- to 3-month period of exercise training geared toward the specific athletic endeavor to be undertaken will result in substantial improvements in thermoregulatory capacity and is an absolute requirement for horses required to compete in hot ambient conditions. 2. Although physical training in a cool environment improves physiologic responses to exercise at high ambient temperatures, a 2-week period of moderate exercise training in these more adverse conditions is necessary for optimization of thermoregulatory function and physical performance. 3. Heat acclimation does not reduce the need for close monitoring of horses during training and competition in the heat. This is particularly true in hot, humid ambient conditions, where the biophysical limitations to sweat evaporation can result in development of severe hyperthermia, regardless of the state of training or heat acclimation.",0,398

We successfully model their absorption and CD spectra based on the high-resolution structures. We assume that these spectra originate from seven interacting transition dipole moments: the first corresponds to the 0-0 transition of the carotenoid, whereas the remaining six represent higher vibronic components of the S2 state. From the absorption spectra we get an estimate of the Franck-Condon factors of these transitions. Furthermore, we investigate the broadening mechanisms that lead to the final shape of the spectra and get an insight into the interaction energy between carotenoids. Finally, we examine the consequences of rotations of the carotenoid transition dipole moment and of deformations in the light-harvesting 2 complex rings. Comparison of the modeled carotenoid spectra with modeled spectra of the bacteriochlorophyll QY region leads to a refinement of the modeling procedure and an improvement of all calculated results. We therefore propose that the combined carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll CD can be used as an accurate reflection of the overall structure of the light-harvesting complexes.",0,399

Doppler ultrasound (DU), Angiography and MRI revealed arteroportal fistulas (APF) and diversion of mesenteric-splenoportal flow through spontaneous splenorenal shunts (SSRS) in the systemic circulation. The patient was transplanted and the ARHA and GDA were distally sectioned; the HA was anastomosed to the donor HA; the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was detached from the splenopancreatic venous bed by sectioning and ligating the Henle trunk, by ligating an posterior-inferior pancreatic vein and, finally, by positioning an iliac vein interposition graft between the SMV and the donor PV. The postanastomotic SMV trunk and recipient PV were ligated below and above the pancreatic head, respectively.RESULTSReperfusion and late liver function were good. DU and MRI studies showed an effective portal flow and the maintenance of a normal splenopancreatic vein outflow through the SSRS.DISCUSSIONAPF represent a serious clinical problem, particularly in patients who need LT. The persistence of arterial flow into the PV is dangerous for the long-term liver function. A particular surgical strategy, strictly tailored to the hemodynamic conditions, has to be planned.CONCLUSIONSExtrahepatic multiple APF would no longer to represent a contraindication to LT, although this claim needs to be confirmed in the light of further experience and a longer-term follow-up.",0,400

Radiol Med 123(3","PURPOSE: A new detachable microvascular plug (MVP, Reverse Medical((R)), Irvine, CA, USA) has been recently developed; three models are available according to the size (MVP3-MVP5-MVP7). MVP3 and MVP5 are released through a 0.027'' microcatheter, MVP7 through a 4 Fr catheter. This series aims to describe an initial single-center experience examining intraprocedural safety and technical success of MVP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients (mean age 55.1 years) have been treated for arterial embolization using MVP; eight extracranial and two intracranial arterial embolizations have been performed. The embolizations were because of: four bleedings, three aneurysms, two pseudoaneurysms, and one presurgical nephrectomy. RESULTS: MVP3 was used in five cases, MVP5 in four cases, and MVP 7 once. In all cases, the MVP was successfully released in < 1 min. In six patients, the MVP was the sole embolizing agent employed, while in four subjects, it was positioned complementary after coils. The technical and clinical success was obtained in 100%; hemorrhages were interrupted and aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms did not show recanalization at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MVP seems to be a safe embolizing device that interventional radiologists should consider when facing arterial embolization of both body and neuroarterial districts; the main advantage is related to MVP3 and MVP5 models that can be adopted for distal embolization thanks to the precise release through 0.027'' microcatheter.",0,404

This can typically be achieved by nanostructured electrodes but all too often at the expense of complexity and cost-effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate the simple and low-cost fabrication of a new type of ZnO-SnO2:F nanocomposite thin film by combining spin-coated ZnO nanoparticles on glass with fluorine-doped SnO2 thin films deposited by atmospheric spray pyrolysis. The resulting nanocomposites exhibit a dual surface morphology featuring rough ZnO-SnO2:F nanostructures along with the original smooth SnO2:F thin film. By readily modulating the surface morphology of ZnO-SnO2:F nanocomposite thin films with the initial ZnO NP surface coverage, the scattering efficiency of the incident light can remarkably be controlled over the 400-1100 nm solar spectrum wavelength range. High quality hazy ZnO-SnO2:F thin layers are therefore formed with an averaged haze factor ranging from 0.4 to 64.2% over the 400-1100 nm solar spectrum range while the sheet resistance is kept smaller than 15 Ω/sq for an average total optical transmittance close to 80%, substrate absorption and reflection included. Eventually, optical simulations using Fourier transform techniques are performed for computing the obtained haze factors and show good agreement with experimental data in the 400-1100 nm solar spectrum wavelength range.

We show that this geometry enhances adhesion because of its ability to trap interfacial cracks in highly compliant contact regimes between successive fibril detachments. This results in the requirement that the externally supplied energy release rate for interfacial separation be greater than the intrinsic work of adhesion, in a manner analogous to lattice trapping of cracks in crystalline solids.",0,406

Psychiatrists are also encouraged to receive supervision when dealing with difficult patients or when involved in personal events that have the potential to have an impact on their psychotherapeutic work. Nevertheless, a literature search, conducted through Medline, revealed few publications dealing with supervision of psychiatrists who conduct psychotherapy in clinical settings after completion of training. This article discusses the issues involved in psychotherapy supervision for the supervisor, supervised psychiatrists, and their practice settings and patients. The author first discusses the benefits of psychotherapy supervision for psychiatrists in clinical practice, including helping psychiatrists maintain and improve psychotherapeutic skills, assistance in dealing with patients who have complex or especially challenging problems (e.g., personality disorders, intractable depression, difficulties with compliance, complex psychosocial problems), addressing ethical concerns, boundary issues, and transference and countertransference, and helping psychiatrists deal with personal issues that may cause difficulties in providing psychotherapy or issues that arise in working with a multidisciplinary team. The author then reviews key issues related to the supervisory process, including group versus individual supervision, the role of the supervisor, different supervisory styles, and factors that can contribute to feelings of shame or vulnerability in the supervisee. The author also discusses different supervisory styles, clarifies the distinction between therapy and supervision, and discusses issues that arise in the supervision of experienced psychodynamic therapists.

Microscopic characteristics of spores from dried spores samples were investigated, as well as the morphology of the colonies obtained from spores that survived during mission. The selected fungal species were: Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium herbarum, Ulocladium chartarum, and Basipetospora halophila. They have been chosen mainly based on their involvement in the biodeterioration of different substrate in the ISS as well as their presence as possible contaminants of the ISS. From biological point of view, three of the selected species are black fungi, with high melanin content and therefore highly resistant to space radiation. The visual inspection and analysis of the images taken before and after the short and the long term experiments have shown that all biocontainers were returned to Earth without damages. Microscope images of the lids of the culture plates revealed that the spores of all species were actually not detached from the surface of the wafers and did not contaminate the lids. From the adhesion point of view all types of wafers can be used in space experiments, with a special comment on the viability in the particular case of iron wafers when used for spores that belong to B. halophila (halophilic strain). This is encouraging in performing experiments with fungi without risking contamination. The spore viability was lower in the experiment for long time to ISS conditions than that of the short experiment. From the observations, it is suggested that the environment of the enclosed biocontainer, as well as the species'specific behaviour have an important effect, reducing the viability in time. Even the spores were not detached from the surface of the wafers, it was observed that spores used in the long term experiment lost the outer layer of their coat without affecting the viability since they were still protected by the middle and the inner layer of the coating. This research highlights a new protocol to perform spaceflight experiments inside the ISS with fungal spores in microgravity conditions, under the additional effect of possible cosmic radiation.

A post hoc diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis was also performed on selected subjects.RESULTSThe T2 values were significantly decreased on the right-side of the subjects with BD compared with that of the control subjects. Hemispheric difference was also observed in the BD group, with decreased T2 on the right side compared with the left side. No significant difference was observed between left and right CPC T2 in control subjects. For participants who had both T2 and DTI measurements, significant DTI differences were observed: On the left side, fractional anisotropy was reduced and trace and radial diffusivity were increased, whereas on the right side, trace was increased and T2 was decreased in subjects with BD compared with control subjects.CONCLUSIONSOur findings suggest that the observed T2 difference is a reflection of cerebral blood flow rather than an alteration of the fluidity of cell membranes. It is possible that myelin damage occurs on the left side in early-onset BD, in addition to changes in the blood flow.

The demonstrated paper exhibits good conductivity due to the formation of a continuous coating of polyaniline (PANI) over the cellulose nanofibers (CNF) during in situ polymerization, which is evident from scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The free hydroxyl groups on the surface of nanocellulose fibers promptly form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with PANI, which plays a vital role in shielding electromagnetic radiations and makes the cellulose nanopapers even more robust. These composite nanopapers exhibited an average shielding effectiveness of ca. -23 dB (>99% attenuation) at 8.2 GHz with 1 mm paper thickness. The fabricated papers exhibited an effective attenuation of electromagnetic waves by a predominant absorption mechanism (ca. 87%) rather than reflection (ca. 13%), which is highly desirable for the present-day telecommunication sector. Unlike metal-based shields, these demonstrated PANI/CNF papers have given a new platform for designing green microwave attenuators via an absorption mechanism. The prime novelty of the present study is that these robust PANI/CNF nanopapers have the ability to attenuate incoming microwave radiations to an extent that is 360% higher than the shielding effectiveness value reported in the previous literature. This makes them suitable for use in commercial electronic gadgets. This demonstrated work also opens up new avenues for using cellulose nanofibers as an effective substrate for fabricating conductive flexible papers using polyaniline. The direct current conductivity value of PANI/CNF nanopaper was 0.314 S/cm, which is one of the key requisites for the fabrication of efficient electromagnetic shields.

B 121(17","Proteins exist in ensembles of conformational states that interconvert on various motional time scales. High-energy states of proteins, often referred to as conformationally excited states, are sparsely populated and have been found to play an essential role in many biological functions. However, detecting these states is quite difficult for conventional structural techniques. Recent progress in solution NMR spectroscopy made it possible to detect conformationally excited states in soluble proteins and characterize them at high resolution. As for soluble proteins, integral or membrane-associated proteins populate different structural states often modulated by their lipid environment. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is the method of choice to study membrane proteins, as it can detect both ground and excited states in their natural lipid environments. In this work, we apply newly developed 1H-detected 15N-HSQC type experiments under moderate magic angle spinning speeds to detect the conformationally excited states of phospholamban (PLN), a single-pass cardiac membrane protein that regulates Ca2+ transport across sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. In its unbound state, the cytoplasmic domain of PLN exists in equilibrium between a T state, which is membrane bound and helical, and an R state, which is membrane detached and unfolded. The R state is important for regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, but also for binding to protein kinase A. By hybridizing 1H detected solution and solid-state NMR techniques, it is possible to detect and resolve the amide resonances of the R state of PLN in liquid crystalline lipid bilayers.

While there are conventional avenues to achieving status among adolescents, engaging in adult-like, or pseudomature, behaviors such as substance use or sexual activity is a frequent occurrence. Although past research has examined the consequences of adolescent delinquency, what remains unclear is the long-term fate of adolescents who are both popular and antisocial. Using data from a sample of African American males (N = 339) we employ latent class analysis to examine the adult consequences of achieving popularity during adolescence by engaging in pseudomature behavior. Our results identified four classes of adolescents: the conventionals, the pseudomatures, the delinquents, and the detached. The conventionals were low on popularity, pseudomature behavior, and affiliation with deviant peers but high on academic commitment. The pseudomatures were high on popularity, adult-like behavior, and academic commitment but low on affiliation with delinquent peers. The delinquents were low on popularity and school achievement but high on pseudomature behavior and affiliations with delinquent peers. Finally, the detached were low on school commitment, popularity and pseudomature behavior but they report high involvement with a delinquent peer group. By early adulthood, the costs of adolescent adult-like behavior were evident. Early popularity and academic commitment did not portend later social competence or college completion for the pseudomatures. Instead, they frequently experienced an early transition to parenthood, a likely consequence of precocious sexual activity. These findings suggest that interventions should not focus only on the most delinquent adolescents but also need to attend to the pseudomature students who are brimming with promise but are flirting with behaviors that may subvert realization of this potential.",0,416

CeO(2) is of particular interest because its reducibility affects the redox of organic molecules. In this work, the adsorption and thermal evolution of formic acid and formate on highly ordered films of fully oxidized CeO(2)(111) and highly reduced CeO(x)(111) surfaces have been studied using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) under ultra-high vacuum conditions, and the experimental results are combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to probe the identity, symmetry, and bonding of the surface intermediates. Disordered ice, ordered alpha-polymorph and molecular formic acid bonded through the carbonyl are observed at low temperatures. By 250 K, desorption and deprotonation lead to formate coexisting with hydroxyl on CeO(2)(111), identified to be a bridging bidentate formate species that is coordinated to Ce cations in nearly C(2v) symmetry and interacting strongly with neighboring H. Changes in the spectra at higher temperatures are consistent with additional tilting of the formate, resulting in C(s)(2) or lower symmetry. This change in bonding is caused primarily by interaction with oxygen vacancies introduced by water desorption at 300 K. On reduced CeO(x), multiple low-symmetry formate states exist likewise due to interactions with oxygen vacancies. Isotopic studies demonstrate that the formyl hydrogen does not contribute to H incorporated in hydroxyl on the surface, and that both formate oxygen atoms may exchange with lattice oxygen at 400 K. The combined experimental and theoretical results thus provide important insights on the surface reaction pathways of formic acid on ceria.",0,417

Ultrasound intensities in the near field are below therapeutic levels and, under normal conditions, heating of the patient skin is minimal. However, increased absorption of ultrasound energy within sensitive skin areas or areas with differing acoustic properties, such as scars, may lead to skin burns and therefore these areas must be kept outside the near field of the FUS beam. Depending on their location and size the sensitive areas may either obstruct parts of the fibroid from being treated or prevent the entire MRgFUS treatment altogether. The purpose of this work is to evaluate acoustic reflector materials that can be applied to protect skin and the underlying sensitive areas. Reflection coefficients of cork (0.88) and foam (0.91) based materials were evaluated with a hydrophone. An ExAblate 2000 MRgFUS system was used to simulate clinical treatment with discs of reflector materials placed in a near field underneath a gel phantom. MR thermometry was used to monitor temperature elevations as well as the integrity of the focal spot. The phantom measurements showed acoustic shadow zones behind the reflectors with zone depths changing between 7 and 27 mm, for reflector disc diameters increasing from 10 to 30 mm (40 mm diameter discs completely blocked the FUS beam at the depth evaluated). The effects on thermal lesions due to the presence of the reflectors in the FUS beam were found to diminish with decreasing disc diameter and increasing sonication depth. For a 20 mm diameter disc and beyond 50 mm sonication depth, thermal lesions were minimally affected by the presence of the disc.

The new technique described here uses this surface property to control the reflectance of a surface using frustration of total internal reflection. Surface chemistry and appropriate micro-scale and nano-scale geometries are combined to produce interfaces with low adhesion to water and the degree to which incident light is reflected at this interface is controlled by the movement of water, thereby modifying the optical characteristics at the interface. The low adhesion of water to superhydrophobic surfaces is particularly advantageous in imaging applications where power use must be minimized. This paper describes the general approach, as well as a proof-of-principle experiment in which the reflectance was controlled by moving a water drop into and out of contact with a superhydrophobic surface by variation of applied electrostatic pressure.",0,421

Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987","There is evidence of adverse health impacts from human exposure to particulate air pollution, including increased rates of respiratory and cardiovascular illness, hospitalizations, and pre-mature mortality. Most recent hypotheses assign an important role to ultrafine particles (UFP) (<0.1 μm) and to associated transition metals (in particular Fe). In a large city like Rome, where many active people spend more than one hour per day in private or public transportation, it may be important to evaluate the level of exposure to harmful pollutants which occurs during urban travelling. In this context, the aim of this work was to examine the relative contribution of different transport modes to total daily exposure. We performed experimental measurements during both morning and evening traffic peak hours throughout the winter season (December 2013-March 2014), for a total of 98 trips. Our results suggest that the lowest UFP exposures are experienced by underground train commuters, with an average number concentration of 14 134 cm-3, and are largely a reflection of the routes being at greater distance from vehicular traffic. Motorcyclists experienced significantly higher average concentrations (73 168 cm-3) than all other exposure classes, and this is most likely a result of the presence of high-concentration and short-duration peaks which do not occur when the same routes are traveled by car. UFP concentrations in subway train environments were found to be comparable to urban background levels. Still, in underground trains we found the highest values of PM10 mass concentration with a maximum value of 422 μg/m3. PM10 concentration in trains was found to be four and two times higher than what was measured in car and motorbike trips, respectively. Transport mode contribution to total integrated UFP daily exposure was found to be 16.3%-20.9% while travelling by car, 28.7% for motorbike trips, and 8.7% for subway trips. Due to lower exposure times, commuting by car and motorbike is comparable to other daily activities in terms of exposure. Our data can provide relevant information for transport decision-making and increase environmental awareness in the hope that the information about inhaled pollutants can translate into a more rational approach to urban travelling.",0,424

Traditionally, understanding of the psychiatric and psychological effects of trauma have been developed from studies with adults and then applied to trauma-exposed children with some modifications. While this is an important step to understanding the sequelae of trauma in children and adolescents, the adverse developmental effects of traumatic exposures on the rapidly evolving neurological, physical, social and psychological capacities of children calls for a developmentally sensitive framework for understanding, assessing and treating trauma-exposed children. The importance of early attachment relationships in infancy and childhood means that severely disrupted early caregiving relationships may have far-reaching and lifelong developmental consequences and can therefore be considered traumatic. Given the high rates of violence and trauma exposure of South African children and adolescents, the need for a developmentally based understanding of the effects of trauma on child and adolescent mental health becomes even more pronounced.

B, Biointerfaces 49(2","The present study focused on the shear-induced detachment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in adhesive contact with a 316L stainless steel surface using a shear stress flow chamber, with a view to determining the respective influence of the yeast surface properties and the support characteristics. The effect of cultivation of S. cerevisiae yeast cells on their subsequent detachment from the solid surface was particularly investigated. In order to elucidate the role of stainless steel, non-metallic supports were used as control, covering a broad range of surface properties such as surface free energy and roughness: polypropylene (hydrophobic), polystyrene (mildly hydrophobic, similar to stainless steel) and glass (hydrophilic). All materials were very smooth with respect to the size of yeast. First, experiments were carried out on two types of yeast cells, just rehydrated in saline solution, a biological model widely used in the literature. The influence of the ionic strength (1.5 and 150 mM NaCl) on glass and stainless steel was evaluated. Unlike on glass, no clear evidence was found for electrostatic repulsion with stainless steel since high adhesion was observed whatever the ionic strength. A lack of correlation in adhesion results was also obtained when considering the surface physico-chemical characteristics of type I (hydrophilic) and type II (hydrophobic) rehydrated cells and those of both polymers. It was postulated that unavoidable ""sticky"" compounds were present on the cell wall, which could not be completely removed during the successive washings of the rehydrated cell suspension before use. This could dramatically alter the yeast surface properties and modify the adhesion strength, thus clearly demonstrating the necessity to work with yeast coming from fresh cultures. Biologically active yeast cells were then used. Once cultured, type I- and type II-yeast cells were shown to exhibit the same hydrophilic properties. Regardless of the material used, for the same ionic strength (150 mM NaCl), yeast adhesion was drastically reduced compared to rehydrated yeast cells. Among all the materials tested, the specificity of 316L stainless steel was clearly established. Indeed, for glass and polymers, cell adhesion was substratum-dependent and driven by the balance between the Lifshitz-van der Waals and Lewis acid/base interactions. Despite nearly identical surface free energies for polystyrene and stainless steel, the metallic surface promoted a totally distinct behaviour which was characterized by a strong - although highly variable - yeast adhesion.",0,430

The control group received saline solution on the same dosing schedule. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks, 20 animals in each group were killed (4 for histologic assessment and 16 for biomechanical testing). Outcomes included qualitative histologic assessment to determine new fibrocartilage formation and collagen fiber organization. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to localize TNF-α, ED1 and ED2 macrophages, and tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase. Biomechanical testing was performed to determine the ultimate load to failure, stiffness, cross-sectional area, and ultimate stress to failure.RESULTSQualitative assessments of histology showed that the experimental group had more cartilage formation at 4 weeks but not at 2 or 8 weeks. There was less TNF-α staining in the experimental group at 4 and 8 weeks, and there were fewer ED1 macrophages at 4 weeks compared with controls. The ultimate load to failure was greater in the experimental group compared with controls at 2 weeks (13.3 ± 2.6 N v 11.2 ± 2.7 N, P = .05) and at 4 weeks (21.7 ± 4.6 N v 18.5 ± 2.1 N, P = .04).

The Journal of chemical physics 144(24","Superalkali cations, known to possess low vertical electron affinities (VEAs), high vertical detachment energies, and large highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gaps, are intriguing chemical species. Thermodynamically, such species need to be the global minima in order to serve as the promising targets for experimental realization. In this work, we propose the strategies of polyhalogenation and polyalkalination for designing the superalkali cations. By applying these strategies, the local-minimum planar pentacoordinate carbon (ppC) cluster CBe5 can be modified to form a series of star-like superalkali ppC or quasi-ppC CBe5X5 (+) (X = F, Cl, Br, Li, Na, K) cations containing a CBe5 moiety. Polyhalogenation and polyalkalination on the CBe5 unit may help eliminate the high reactivity of bare CBe5 molecule by covering the reactive Be atoms with noble halogen anions and alkali cations. Computational exploration of the potential energy surfaces reveals that the star-like ppC or quasi-ppC CBe5X5 (+) (X = F, Cl, Br, Li, Na, K) clusters are the true global minima of the systems. The predicted VEAs for CBe5X5 (+) range from 3.01 to 3.71 eV for X = F, Cl, Br and 2.12-2.51 eV for X = Li, Na, K, being below the lower bound of the atomic ionization potential of 3.89 eV in the periodic table. Large HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are also revealed for the species: 10.76-11.07 eV for X = F, Cl, Br and 4.99-6.91 eV for X = Li, Na, K. These designer clusters represent the first series of superalkali cations with a ppC center. Bonding analyses show five Be-X-Be three-center two-electron (3c-2e) σ bonds for the peripheral bonding, whereas the central C atom is associated with one 6c-2e π bond and three 6c-2e σ bonds, rendering (π and σ) double aromaticity. Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the CBe5 motif is robust in the clusters. As planar hypercoordination carbon species are often thermodynamically unstable and highly reactive, the superalkali cation characters of these ppC species should be highlighted, which may be suitable for experimental realization.",0,435

The aim of this paper is to develop a novel SpO2 monitoring system, which detects photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals at hypothenar with a reflection-mode sensor embedded into a glove.METHODSA special photo-detector section was designed with two photodiodes arranged symmetrically to the red and infrared light-emitting diodes (LED) to enhance the signal quality. The reflective sensor was placed in a soft silicon substrate sewn in a glove to fit the surface of the hypothenar. To lower the power consumption, the LED driving current was reduced and energy-efficient electronic components were applied. The performance for PPG signal detection and SpO2 monitoring was evaluated by human hypoxia experiments. Accelerometer-based adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) methods applying the least mean squares (LMS) and recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms were studied to suppress motion artifact.RESULTSA total of 20 subjects participated in the hypoxia experiment. The degree of comfort for wearing this system was accepted by them. The PPG signals were detected effectively at SpO2 levels from about 100-70%.

The present study was an exploration of dissociative experiences in multitraumatized war-refugee youth. METHOD: In this study, we used a mixed-method approach by grouping participants according to a Western-based dissociation measure (the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale; Armstrong, Putnam, Carlson, Libero, & Smith, 1997), and conducting qualitative and quantitative analyses of their verbal descriptions of mental experiences related to dissociation in the aftermath of war and resettlement. The sample included 40 refugee youth, ages 13 to 21, 19 girls and 21 boys resettled in Sweden because of war and persecution. RESULTS: Severe trauma-related dissociation was a problem for a considerable subgroup of the sample. Some dissociative experiences were present in all the sample; others were restricted to the most dissociative group. The correlates of severe dissociation included high frequency and severity of emotional dysregulation and intensity, negative self- and body-perception, depressive mood, and experiences of detachment.

Our studies of molecular pathology in the canine BEST1 disease model revealed retina-wide abnormalities at the RPE-PR interface associated with defects in the RPE microvillar ensheathment and a cone PR-associated insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix. In vivo imaging demonstrated a retina-wide RPE-PR microdetachment, which contracted with dark adaptation and expanded upon exposure to a moderate intensity of light.

Computer methods and programs in biomedicine 109(3","Within the last decade the quantification of pulse wave reflections mainly focused on measures of central aortic systolic pressure and its augmentation through reflections based on pulse wave analysis (PWA). A complementary approach is the wave separation analysis (WSA), which quantifies the total amount of arterial wave reflection considering both aortic pulse and flow waves. The aim of this work is the introduction and comparison of aortic blood flow models for WSA assessment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed modeling approaches (Windkessel, triangular and averaged flow), comparisons against Doppler measurements are made for 148 patients with preserved ejection fraction. Stepwise regression analysis between WSA and PWA parameters are performed to provide determinants of methodological differences. Against Doppler measurement mean difference and standard deviation of the amplitudes of the decomposed forward and backward pressure waves are comparable for Windkessel and averaged flow models. Stepwise regression analysis shows similar determinants between Doppler and Windkessel model only. The results indicate that the Windkessel method provides accurate estimates of wave reflection in subjects with preserved ejection fraction. The comparison with waveforms derived from Doppler ultrasound as well as recently proposed simple triangular and averaged flow waves showed that this approach may reduce variability and provide realistic results.",0,441

BMC Psychiatry 18(1","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to better understand early-stage mental health recovery experiences of people living with severe and persistent mental illness and complex needs. METHODS: Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 people engaged in an Australian program specifically designed for people facing complex barriers to their recovery. Interview data were analysed thematically using constant comparative methods. RESULTS: Participants described engaging with seven interconnecting aspects of early recovery: (1) engaging with the challenge of recovery; (2) struggling for a secure and stable footing; (3) grieving for what was and what could have been; (4) seeking and finding hope; (5) navigating complex relationships; (6) connecting with formal and informal support, and finally, (7) juggling a complexity of health issues. CONCLUSIONS: This study illuminated the complexity of earlier-stage recovery which was characterised both by challenging personal circumstances and a hope for the future. It illustrated that even at an early point in their recovery journey, and amidst these challenging circumstances, people still actively engage with support, draw on inner strengths, source resources and find accomplishments. Stability and security was foundational to the ability of participants to draw on their own strengths and move forward. Stability came when material needs, including housing, were addressed, and an individual was able to connect with a supportive network of workers, carers, friends and family.",0,444

A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach was used in the analysis, which revealed that carers' reflections were focused on the carers themselves, on the patients, on context and on the work itself in the shared everyday life. After repeated stimulated recall interviews, together with supervision every month, an improvement in carers' ability to verbalize their reflections and an awareness and knowledge about their own influence on care quality were seen. The interdependence between carers and patients made it necessary for the carers to cope with many complicated here-and-now situations, and in their reflections the carers kept coming back to their efforts to maintain a sense of dignity for the patients as well as for themselves.

The reflectors were immersed in water solutions containing nanogram per milliliter (ppb) concentrations of perchlorate. After this step, the reflectors were taken out of the solution and they were analyzed by TXRF, using a copper X-ray tube and helium flow on the target (to lower the argon peak which is present in the air). The effects of various experimental parameters were examined, and the possibility of discrimination between chloride and perchlorate anions was shown.

Acta biomaterialia 59: 181-191.","Most photothermal converting systems are not biodegradable, which bring the uneasiness when they are administered into human body due to the uncertainty of their fate. Hereby, we developed a mussel-inspired PLGA/polydopamine core-shell nanoparticle for cancer photothermal and chemotherapy. With the help of an anti-EGFR antibody, the nanoparticle could effectively enter head and neck cancer cells and convert near-infrared light to heat to trigger drug release from PLGA core for chemotherapy as well as ablate tumors by the elevated temperature. Due to the unique nanoparticle concentration dependent peak working-temperature nature, an overheating or overburn situation can be easily prevented. Since the nanoparticle was retained in the tumor tissue and subsequently released its payload inside the cancer cells, no any doxorubicin-associated side effects were detected. Thus, the developed mussel-inspired PLGA/polydopamine core-shell nanoparticle could be a safe and effective tool for the treatment of head and neck cancer.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe described EGFR targeted PLGA/polydopamine core-shell nanoparticle (PLGA/PD NP) is novel in the following aspects: Different from most photothermal converting nanomaterials, PLGA/PD NP is biodegradable, which eliminates the long-term safety concerns thwarting the clinical application of photothermal therapy. Different from most photothermal nanomaterials, upon NIR irradiation, PLGA/PD NP quickly heats its surrounding environment to a NP concentration dependent peak working temperature and uniquely keeps that temperature constant through the duration of light irradiation. Due to this unique property an overheating or overburn situation for the adjacent healthy tissue can be easily avoided. The PLGA/PD NP releases its payload through detaching PD shell under NIR laser irradiation. The EGFR-targeted doxorubicin-loaded PLGA/PD NP effectively eradicate head and neck tumor in vivo through the synergism of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy while not introducing doxorubicin associated cardiotoxicity.",0,449

BMC biophysics 4: 18.","BACKGROUNDRobust self-organization of subcellular structures is a key principle governing the dynamics and evolution of cellular life. In fission yeast cells undergoing division, the mitotic spindle spontaneously emerges from the interaction of microtubules, motor proteins and the confining cell walls, and asters and vortices have been observed to self-assemble in quasi-two dimensional microtubule-kinesin assays. There is no clear microscopic picture of the role of the active motors driving this pattern formation, and the relevance of continuum modeling to filament-scale structures remains uncertain.RESULTSHere we present results of numerical simulations of a discrete filament-motor protein model confined to a pressurised cylindrical box. Stable spindles, nematic configurations, asters and high-density semi-asters spontaneously emerge, the latter pair having also been observed in cytosol confined within emulsion droplets. State diagrams are presented delineating each stationary state as the pressure, motor speed and motor density are varied. We further highlight a parameter regime where vortices form exhibiting collective rotation of all filaments, but have a finite life-time before contracting to a semi-aster. Quantifying the distribution of life-times suggests this contraction is a Poisson process. Equivalent systems with fixed volume exhibit persistent vortices with stochastic switching in the direction of rotation, with switching times obeying similar statistics to contraction times in pressurised systems. Furthermore, we show that increasing the detachment rate of motors from filament plus-ends can both destroy vortices and turn some asters into vortices.CONCLUSIONSWe have shown that discrete filament-motor protein models provide new insights into the stationary and dynamical behavior of active gels and subcellular structures, because many phenomena occur on the length-scale of single filaments. Based on our findings, we argue the need for a deeper understanding of the microscopic activities underpinning macroscopic self-organization in active gels and urge further experiments to help bridge these lengths.",0,450

The use of animal-derived serum is common in hMSC culture but has many drawbacks such as limited supply, lot-to-lot variability, increased regulatory burden, possibility of pathogen transmission, and reduced scope for process optimization. These constraints may impact the development of a consistent large-scale process and therefore must be addressed. The aim of this work was therefore to run a pilot study in the systematic development of serum-free hMSC manufacturing process. Human bone-marrow derived hMSCs were expanded on fibronectin-coated, non-porous plastic microcarriers in 100 mL stirred spinner flasks at a density of 3 × 10(5) cells.mL(-1) in serum-free medium. The hMSCs were successfully harvested by our recently-developed technique using animal-free enzymatic cell detachment accompanied by agitation followed by filtration to separate the hMSCs from microcarriers, with a post-harvest viability of 99.63 ± 0.03%. The hMSCs were found to be in accordance with the ISCT characterization criteria and maintained hMSC outgrowth and colony-forming potential. The hMSCs were held in suspension post-harvest to simulate a typical pooling time for a scaled expansion process and cryopreserved in a serum-free vehicle solution using a controlled-rate freezing process. Post-thaw viability was 75.8 ± 1.4% with a similar 3 h attachment efficiency also observed, indicating successful hMSC recovery, and attachment. This approach therefore demonstrates that once an hMSC line and appropriate medium have been selected for production, multiple unit operations can be integrated to generate an animal component-free hMSC production process from expansion through to cryopreservation.",0,451

Although microcavitation was observed during the detachment of individual MSAMSs, which was a consequence of water inclusions present at the glass-MSAMS contact interface subjected to negative pressure (tension), the pull-off forces were consistently lower, around 50%, of those measured under ambient conditions.

It is offered alongside outpatient psychotherapy for the purpose of strengthening autonomy, self-reflection and self-care and to increase the likelihood of being able to stay in therapy by avoiding lengthy inpatient hospitalizations.Aims: To investigate participants’ experiences with BA during the pilot phase of the Brief Admission Skåne Randomized Controlled Trial (BASRCT), in order to detect possible strengths and limitations of the intervention and gain knowledge to facilitate implementation of BA at other treatment centers.Method: Eight participants randomized to BA were interviewed to obtain their experience of BA, or alternatively their reasons for choosing not to use BA. Thematic analysis was conducted upon their transcribed interviews.Results: Reported as most helpful by the participants was the structure/routines at the ward and the positive attitudes from the staff. However, some individuals reported problems with perceived negative attitudes from the staff administering BA and negative rumination about themselves. The reported reasons to request BA were: preventing urges to self-harm from escalating; ending isolation; preventing longer admissions and forced admission; feelings of emotional exhaustion, and the need for rest and support in re-creating a daily routine. Reasons for not requesting BA were fear of rejection, questioning the method; presumed room shortage; difficulties in deciding whether one’s problems are serious enough; experiencing the situation to be too clinically acute.Conclusion: The results from this study indicated the importance of repeated staff education on all aspects of BA when it is being newly implemented, as well as the importance of working with attitudes of staff delivering BA. These were the key ingredients in making BA implementation successful. Our findings may be of value to other treatment centers implementing BA for the first time.Trial registration: NCT02985047.

Simulations, when corroborated by experimental data yielding global information on the folding process, can provide this level of insight. Molecular dynamics (MD) has often been combined with force spectroscopy experiments to decipher the unfolding mechanism of titin immunoglobulin-like single or multidomain, the giant multimodular protein from sarcomeres, yielding information on the sequential events during titin unfolding under stretching. Here, we used high-pressure NMR to monitor the unfolding of titin I27 Ig-like single domain and tandem. Because this method brings residue-specific information on the folding process, it can provide quasiatomic details on this process without the help of MD simulations. Globally, the results of our high-pressure analysis are in agreement with previous results obtained by the combination of experimental measurements and MD simulation and/or protein engineering, although the intermediate folding state caused by the early detachment of the AB β-sheet, often reported in previous works based on MD or force spectroscopy, cannot be detected.

In our experiment, both adsorbates are in equilibrium with their respective vapors in a cold cell. In our infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy measurements, the SF6 coverage on the surface is monitored by the frequency shift due to dynamic dipole coupling of the collective mode of the strong SF6 ν3 vibrational resonance. Simulations relate this frequency shift to the SF6 areal density. Below T ≈ 134 K, with increasing Xe pressure, a small amount Xe dissolves in the solid SF6 monolayer preceding its displacement by a solid predominantly Xe monolayer in a first-order transition. Above 134 K, there is a weaker first-order transition to a mixed liquid monolayer, followed by continuous increase in Xe concentration.

Topics in current chemistry 313: 189-215.","Basic concepts in tunneling spectroscopy applied to molecular systems are presented. Junctions of the form M-A-M, M-I-A-M, and M-I-A-I'-M, where A is an active molecular layer, are considered. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is found to be readily applied to all the above device types. It can provide both vibrational and electron spectroscopic data about the molecules comprising the A layer. In IETS there are no strong selection rules (although there are preferences) so that transitions that are normally IR, Raman, or even photon-forbidden can be observed. In the electronic transition domain, spin and Laporte forbidden transitions may be observed. Both vibrational and electronic IETS can be acquired from single molecules. The negative aspect of this seemingly ideal spectroscopic method is the thermal line width of about 5 k(B)T. This limits the useful measurement of vibrational IETS to temperatures below about 10 K. In the case of most electronic transitions where the intrinsic linewidth is much broader, useful experiments above 100 K are possible. One further limitation of electronic IETS is that it is generally limited to transitions with energy less than about 20,000 cm(-1). IETS can be identified by peaks in d(2) I/dV (2) vs bias voltage plots that occur at the same position (but not necessarily same intensity) in either bias polarity.Elastic tunneling spectroscopy is discussed in the context of processes involving molecular ionization and electron affinity states, a technique we call orbital mediated tunneling spectroscopy, or OMTS. OMTS can be applied readily to M-I-A-M and M-I-A-I'-M systems, but application to M-A-M junctions is problematic. Spectra can be obtained from single molecules. Ionization state results correlate well with UPS spectra obtained from the same systems in the same environment. Both ionization and affinity levels measured by OMTS can usually be correlated with one electron oxidation and reduction potentials for the molecular species in solution. OMTS can be identified by peaks in dI/dV vs bias voltage plots that do not occur at the same position in either bias polarity. Because of the intrinsic width of the ionization and affinity transitions, OMTS can be applied at temperatures above 500 K.This is not a comprehensive review of more than 20 years of research and there are many excellent papers that are not cited here.

Method: Thirty eight adults with remitted Major Depressive Disorder completed MemFlex in an uncontrolled clinical trial. This involved an orientation session, followed by self-guided completion of six workbook-based sessions over one-month. Assessments of cognitive performance and depression symptoms were completed at pre- and post-intervention. Results: Results demonstrated medium-sized effects of MemFlex in improving memory specificity and problem solving, and decreasing rumination, and a small effect in reducing cognitive avoidance. No significant change was observed in residual symptoms of depression. Limitations: This study was an uncontrolled trial, and has provided initial evidence to support a larger-scale, randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: These findings provide promising evidence for MemFlex as a cost-effective, low-intensity option for reducing cognitive risk associated with depression.

(2014"," ""Direct quantification of circulating miRNAs in different stages of nasopharyngeal cancerous serum samples in single molecule level with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy."" Analytical chemistry 86(19","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate human gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Growing evidence indicates that the expression profile of miRNAs is highly correlated with the occurrence of human diseases including cancers. Playing important roles in complex gene regulation processes, the aberrant expression pattern of various miRNAs is implicated in different types and even stages of cancer. Besides localizing in cells, many of these miRNAs are found circulating around the body in a wide variety of fluids such as urine, serum and saliva. Surprisingly, these extracellular circulating miRNAs are highly stable and resistant to degradation, and therefore, are considered as promising biomarkers for early cancer diagnostic via noninvasive extraction from body fluids. Unfortunately, the abundance of these small RNAs is ultralow in the body fluids, making it challenging to quantify them in complex sample matrixes. Establishing a sensitive, specific yet simple assay for an accurate quantification of circulating miRNAs is therefore desirable. Our group previously reported a sensitive and specific detection assay of miRNAs in single molecule level with the aid of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we advanced the assay to differentiate the expression of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) up-regulator hsa-mir-205 (mir-205) in serum collected from patients of different stages of NPC. To overcome the background matrix interference in serum, a locked nucleic acid-modified molecular beacon (LNA/MB) was applied as the detection probe to hybridize, capture and detect target mir-205 in serum matrix with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. A detection limit of 500 fM was achieved. The as-developed method was capable of differentiating NPC stages by the level of mir-205 quantified in serum with only 10 μL of serum and the whole assay can be completed in 1 h. The experimental results agreed well with those previously reported whereas the quantity of miR-205 determined by our assay was found comparable to that of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), supporting that this assay can be served as a promising noninvasive detection tool for early NPC diagnosis, monitoring and staging.",0,464

Educational and Child Psychology 29(2","People (parents, carers, teachers, adults, other professionals) seeking the involvement of an educational psychologist (EP) frequently bring longstanding and difficult concerns. Usually, many ways have already been tried to address the difficulty and generally these have been felt to be unsuccessful. The problem then often becomes one that is described as belonging to the person or setting -- the angry child, the bad parent, the weak teacher, the inexperienced leader. Once labelled as such, it becomes less likely to remedy a concern that has become part of someone's identity - the label becomes an established fact. The problem is stuck. Narrative approaches construct problems in a different way; the educational psychology team in Darlington has been interested in applying narrative ideas to the practice and ethos of the service over a number of years. Narrative approaches (White, 2007) view problems as separate from the person or setting and as such are one story amongst many that people have in their lives. This paper presents a reflection on the work of Darlington Educational Psychology Service (DEPS) in developing narrative approaches to practice. The work is considered through a number of case studies including direct work with children and young people, training to bring about organisational change and research. It is suggested that a narrative approach provides a challenge to prevailing socio-cultural narratives and offers alternative richer understandings of behaviours often characterised as problematic.

Heart and circulatory physiology 292(3","The left atrium (LA) acts as a booster pump during late diastole, generating the Doppler transmitral A wave and contributing incrementally to left ventricular (LV) filling. However, after volume loading and in certain disease states, LA contraction fills the LV less effectively, and retrograde flow (i.e., the Doppler Ar wave) into the pulmonary veins increases. The purpose of this study was to provide an energetic analysis of LA contraction to clarify the mechanisms responsible for changes in forward and backward flow. Wave intensity analysis was performed at the mitral valve and a pulmonary vein orifice. As operative LV stiffness increased with progressive volume loading, the reflection coefficient (i.e., energy of reflected wave/energy of incident wave) also increased. This reflected wave decelerated the forward movement of blood through the mitral valve and was transmitted through the LA, accelerating retrograde blood flow in the pulmonary veins. Although total LA work increased with volume loading, the forward hydraulic work decreased and backward hydraulic work increased. Thus wave reflection due to increased LV stiffness accounts for the decrease in the A wave and the increase in the Ar wave measured by Doppler.",0,466

The formation of the fluorescent coumarin allowed the catalytic process to be monitored in real time at the single molecule level using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM). Benchtop experiments conducted in parallel demonstrated that the observed catalysis occurred in solution rather than by pure heterogeneous catalysis and is due to a mobile population of small Sm2O3NP released from a polydisperse original sample containing larger particles. TIRFM provided unique insights by demonstrating that catalysis by these smaller colloidal particles is in fact a surface process, while the larger particles are merely suppliers of the small catalytic nanostructures. We refer to this behaviour as a semi-heterogeneous catalytic system. This work showcases the opportunity that single molecule fluorescence techniques can offer in terms of understanding and ultimately improving benchtop and scaled-up synthesis.

To operate at the limits of resolution of the technique, it is essential to investigate and rigorously quantify the major sources of noise and error; we used theoretical predictions, simulations, advanced image analysis, and detailed characterization of DNA standards to quantify the limits of TIRF-FRET resolution. We present a theoretical description of the major sources of noise, which was in excellent agreement with results for short-timescale smFRET measurements (<200 ms) on individual molecules (as opposed to measurements on an ensemble of single molecules). For longer timescales (>200 ms) on individual molecules, and for FRET distributions obtained from an ensemble of single molecules, we observed significant broadening beyond theoretical predictions; we investigated the causes of this broadening. For measurements on individual molecules, analysis of the experimental noise allows us to predict a maximum resolution of a FRET change of 0.08 with 20-ms temporal resolution, sufficient to directly resolve distance differences equivalent to one DNA basepair separation (0.34 nm). For measurements on ensembles of single molecules, we demonstrate resolution of distance differences of one basepair with 1000-ms temporal resolution, and differences of two basepairs with 80-ms temporal resolution.

The detailed understanding of urban wash-off processes is essential for addressing urban management issues. However, existing modelling approaches are rarely applied for these objectives due to the lack of realistic input data, unsuitability of physical descriptions, and inadequate documentation of model testing. In this context, we implement a method of coupling monitoring surveys with the physically-based FullSWOF (Full Shallow Water equations for Overland Flow) model (Delestre et al., 2014) and the process-based H-R (Hairsine-Rose) model (Hairsine and Rose, 1992a, 1992b) to evaluate urban wash-off process on a road catchment near Paris (Le Perreux sur Marne, Val de Marne, France, 2661 m(2)). This work is the first time that such an approach is applied for road wash-off modelling in the context of urban stormwater runoff. On-site experimental measurements have shown that only the finest particles of the road dry stocks could be transferred to the sewer inlet during rainfall events, and most Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are found in the particulate phase. Simulations over different rainfall events represent promising results in reproducing the various dynamics of water flows and sediment transports at the road catchment scale. Elementary Effects method is applied for sensitivity analysis. It is confirmed that settling velocity (Vs) and initial dry stocks (S) are the most influential parameters in both overall and higher order effects. Furthermore, flow-driven detachment seems to be insignificant in our case study, while raindrop-driven detachment is shown to be the major force for detaching sediment from the studied urban surface.

The current study aims to test the effectiveness of cognitive control training as a preventive intervention in a remitted depressed sample, exploring effects of cognitive control training on rumination and depressive symptomatology, along with indicators of adaptive emotion regulation and functioning. Methods/design: We present a double blind randomized controlled design. Remitted depressed adults will complete 10 online sessions of a cognitive control training targeting working memory functioning or a low cognitive load training (active control condition) over a period of 14 days.

Long-term effects of cognitive control training on broader indicators of functioning will be assessed at three months follow-up (secondary outcome measures).

Method: Effects of CCT were assessed using a double-blind randomized controlled design. RMD patients performed 10 sessions of a working memory-based CCT (N = 34) or a low cognitive load training (N = 34; active control condition) over a period of 14 days.

Brooding and depressive symptomatology were selected as primary outcome measures, alternative indicators for emotion regulation and residual symptomatology were selected as secondary outcome measures, along with indicators of functioning. Results: Compared to an active control condition, CCT demonstrated beneficial effects on a cognitive transfer task, brooding, depressive symptomatology, residual complaints, self-reported use of general maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and resilience after controlling for intention to treat. Furthermore, completers of the CCT reported a reduction in experienced disability and cognitive complaints. However, no beneficial effects were found for self-reported use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.

The presence of Bi-C bonds confirms the heterojunction, on account of which the BiOI nanosheets tightly grew on the surface of carbon and subsequently provided the hierarchical structure, sufficient interfacial interaction and high specific surface area. Significantly, the sufficient interracial interaction is beneficial to the detachment of electrons (e-)-holes (h+) pairs and the Bi-C bonds work like a bridge to rapidly transmit the e- from BiOI to carbon. What's more, the hierarchical structure of BiOI/C efficiently shortened the diffusion pathways of pollutants and the high SBET provided more exposed reaction sites.

In this work, SiC nanofiber mats with or without fiber alignment are fabricated via electrospinning and the microwave electromagnetic properties of their silicone resin composites (5 wt %) are investigated in 2-18 GHz. By comparing with the composite containing SiC whisker, it is found that the nanofiber mats show superior dielectric loss and a minimal reflection loss (RL) of around -49 dB at 8.6 GHz and 4.3 mm thickness, associated with a broad effective absorption (<-10 dB) bandwidth (EAB) of about 7.2 GHz at 2.8 mm thickness. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced (RL = -53 dB at 17.6 GHz and 2.3 mm thickness) by aligning the nanofiber in the plane of mat, accompanied by the shift of absorption peak to higher-frequency direction and broader EAB up to 8.6 GHz at 3 mm. In addition, the stacking ways of aligned SiC nanofiber mats (either parallel or perpendicular) are proved to have a negligible effect on their microwave properties. Compared with parallel stacking of the aligned mats, cross-stacking (perpendicular) only leads to a slight drop of the attenuation ability. It confirms that alignment of nanofiber in the mats offers a more effective approach to improve the microwave absorption properties than changing the ways of stacking. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the low loading fraction (5 wt %) is a great advantage to reduce the weight as well as the cost for large-scale production.

Section A, Foundations of crystallography 56 (Pt 5","While it is known that the kinematical approximation works poorly if at all for transmission electron diffraction, substantial success has been achieved over the last few years in applying it via direct methods to determine atomic structures. This raises an interesting quandary; is the established theory of electron diffraction wrong, or are the apparent successes mirages? The intention of this note is to look more deeply into this question and it is found that the correct answer is neither of the above. Beyond vanishingly thin samples when the kinematical approximation holds rigorously, the distribution of phases can remain effectively kinematical; the summation operator(0) distribution given by the sum of the phase of +g and -g reflections remains peaked, albeit not at zero phase, and has a relatively narrow distribution. This fact is shown via both exploiting prior works on including anomalous-scattering effects into direct methods, and numerical calculations. Provided that the summation operator(0) distribution remains narrow, direct methods and indeed structural refinements have some validity. Even larger unit-cell structures with close to statistically random atomic positions do not approach a kinematical limit but instead an effective statistical kinematical approximation. While there are similarities to what there is in conventional (kinematical) direct methods, there remain major differences; for instance, positivity is no longer a valid constraint and the scattering need not be dominated by heavy atoms.",0,487

Environmental science & technology 45(14","To ensure safe and efficient geologic CO(2) sequestration (GCS), it is crucial to have a better understanding of CO(2)-brine-rock interactions under GCS conditions. In this work, using biotite (K(Mg,Fe)(3)AlSi(3)O(10)(OH,F)(2)) as a model clay mineral, brine-biotite interactions were studied under conditions relevant to GCS sites (95 °C, 102 atm CO(2), and 1 M NaCl solution). After reaction for 3-17 h, fast growth of fibrous illite on flat basal planes of biotite was observed. After 22-70 h reaction, the biotite basal surface cracked, resulting in illite detaching from the surface. Later on (96-120 h), the cracked surface layer was released into solution, thus the inner layer was exposed as a renewed flat basal surface. The cracking and detachment of the biotite surface layer increased the surface area in contact with solution and accelerated biotite dissolution. On biotite edge surfaces, Al-substituted goethite and kaolinite precipitated. In control experiments with water under the same temperature and pressure, neither macroscopic fibrous illite nor cracks were observed. This work provides unique information on biotite-brine interaction under acidic hydrothermal conditions.",0,488

Water research 123: 216-223.","Maximizing the energy-profitable treatment of municipal wastewater (MW) is of significance to achieve energy-neutral operation for wastewater treatment plant. Direct membrane filtration technology has been considered as an effective way to separate organic carbon from MW for subsequent anaerobic energy-recovering process, but its application is restrained by severe membrane fouling issues. Thus, it is essential to identify the substances in MW that are responsible for membrane fouling and find out efficient anti-fouling methods. In this work, an integrated approach through combining multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares analysis with infrared attenuated total reflection mapping was adopted to explore the membrane fouling process, and three coagulants, i.e., polyacrylamide, Al2(SO4)3 and FeCl3, were individually used to mitigate membrane fouling. Results show that the 1-8 μm biopolymer clusters, i.e., humic-like and protein-like substances, were the predominant foulants in MW. In addition, membrane fouling caused by proteins was found to be more severe than that by humic substances. Coagulation pretreatment was demonstrated to be effective in mitigating membrane fouling. Al2(SO4)3 or FeCl3 had superior anti-fouling performance comparing to that of polyacrylamide. The dosage of polyacrylamide needs to be optimized according to the actual MW characteristics as its overdose would cause a substantial decline of membrane flux. These results provide a deep understanding of the membrane fouling mechanisms for organic carbon separation from MW and are beneficial for developing efficient and cost-effective membrane fouling mitigation strategies.",0,489

Ophthalmology 116(11","OBJECTIVETo review the published literature for evaluation of the safety and outcomes of phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) implantation for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism.METHODSLiterature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were conducted on October 7, 2007, and July 14, 2008. The PubMed search was limited to the English language; the Cochrane Library was searched without language limitations. The searches retrieved 261 references. Of these, panel members chose 85 papers that they considered to be of high or medium clinical relevance to this assessment. The panel methodologist rated the articles according to the strength of evidence.RESULTSTwo pIOLs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): one iris-fixated pIOL and one posterior-chamber IOL. In FDA trials of iris-fixated pIOLs, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was >or=20/40 in 84% and >or=20/20 in 31% after 3 years. In FDA trials of posterior-chamber pIOLs, UCVA was >or=20/40 in 81% and >or=20/20 in 41%. Satisfaction with the quality of vision with both types of pIOLs was generally high. Toric anterior- and posterior-chamber pIOLs have shown improved clinical results in European trials compared with spherical pIOLs. Comparative studies showed pIOLs to provide better best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) and refractive predictability and stability compared with LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy and to have a lower risk of retinal detachment compared with refractive lens exchange. Reported complications and long-term safety concerns include endothelial cell loss, cataract formation, secondary glaucoma (pupillary block, pigment dispersion), iris atrophy (pupil ovalization), and traumatic dislocation.CONCLUSIONSPhakic IOL implantation is effective in the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism. In cases of high myopia of -8 diopters or more, pIOLs may provide a better visual outcome than keratorefractive surgeries and better safety than refractive lens exchange. The short-term rates of complications and loss of BSCVA are acceptable. Comprehensive preoperative evaluation and long-term postoperative follow-up examinations are needed to monitor for and prevent serious complications, and to establish long-term safety.",0,490

Results showed that detachment of aging biofilm was mainly attributed by extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) solubilization and dispersion, and activity recovery of aging biofilm mainly depended on biological effects of dominant bacteria. Phosphorus metabolism related bacteria, such as Microbacterium and Micropruina, were responsible for BAF biofilm regeneration.

It may often militate against an informed and open debate among interested parties, with concomitant implications for reducing the danger from environmental hazards. To improve communication, vocabulary needs to be free from jargon and acronyms, and differences in conceptual approach between different disciplines need to be better understood. The definition of the 'community' is itself far from clear-cut, yet questions of how to involve this community in intervention processes are important ones.

Journal of cell science 125: 5790-5799.","In moving cells dynamic microtubules (MTs) target and disassemble substrate adhesion sites (focal adhesions; FAs) in a process that enables the cell to detach from the substrate and propel itself forward. The short-range interactions between FAs and MT plus ends have been observed in several experimental systems, but the spatial overlap of these structures within the cell has precluded analysis of the putative long-range mechanisms by which MTs growing through the cell body reach FAs in the periphery of the cell. In the work described here cell geometry was controlled to remove the spatial overlap of cellular structures thus allowing for unambiguous observation of MT guidance. Specifically, micropatterning of living cells was combined with high-resolution in-cell imaging and gene product depletion by means of RNA interference to study the long-range MT guidance in quantitative detail. Cells were confined on adhesive triangular microislands that determined cell shape and ensured that FAs localized exclusively at the vertices of the triangular cells. It is shown that initial MT nucleation at the centrosome is random in direction, while the alignment of MT trajectories with the targets (i.e. FAs at vertices) increases with an increasing distance from the centrosome, indicating that MT growth is a non-random, guided process. The guided MT growth is dependent on the presence of FAs at the vertices. The depletion of either myosin IIA or myosin IIB results in depletion of F-actin bundles and spatially unguided MT growth. Taken together our findings provide quantitative evidence of a role for long-range MT guidance in MT targeting of FAs.",0,493

The objective of our experimental work was to determine influence of electroporation on the cytotoxic and antitumor effect of a ruthenium(III) compound with hampered transmembrane transport, (imH)[trans-RuCl4(im)2] (KP418) in vitro and in vivo and to determine changes in metastatic potential of cells after ECT with KP418 in vitro.

Our results show that electroporation leads to increased cellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of KP418 in murine melanoma cell lines with low and high metastatic potential, B16-F1 and B16-F10, but not in murine fibrosarcoma cell line SA-1 in vitro which is probably due to variable effectiveness of ECT in different cell lines and tumors. Electroporation does not potentiate the cytotoxicity of KP418 as prominently as the cytotoxicity of CDDP. We also showed that the metastatic potential of cells which survived ECT with KP418 or NAMI-A does not change in vitro: resistance to detachment, invasiveness, and re-adhesion of cells after ECT is not affected.

Differential effects of these attention foci have so far only been examined in the laboratory. Therefore, we conducted an experimental ambulatory assessment study using ruminative and mindful attention inductions in everyday life to examine their effects in a natural context. Methods: Fifty young adults carried palmtops over three weekdays (rumination induction day, mindful attention induction day, noninduction day; randomized cross-over design). Ten times a day, participants rated ruminative self-focus and mood. On the induction days, they were additionally subjected to 3-min inductions of ruminative or mindful attention at each assessment. Results: The two induction modes exhibited differential immediate effects on ruminative self-focus and mood. While induced rumination immediately deteriorated valence and calmness, induced mindful attention specifically enhanced calmness. Depressive symptoms did not moderate these effects. While overall longer term effects of the inductions were missing, the mindful attention day was associated with slightly increasing positive valence over the day. Limitations: The results need to be replicated in high-risk and patient samples to demonstrate the clinical significance of identified effects. Conclusions: Results confirm the emotional relevance of rumination and mindful attention in real world settings. Future work may test whether adaptive attention-focusing instructions delivered in daily life can support clinical interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,495

Inhibition of cell growth and inactivation of matrix-producing bacteria can impair biofilm formation and facilitate removal. Here, we developed a novel nonleachable antibacterial composite with potent antibiofilm activity by directly incorporating polymerizable imidazolium-containing resin (antibacterial resin with carbonate linkage; ABR-C) into a methacrylate-based scaffold (ABR-modified composite; ABR-MC) using an efficient yet simplified chemistry. Low-dose inclusion of imidazolium moiety (∼2 wt %) resulted in bioactivity with minimal cytotoxicity without compromising mechanical integrity of the restorative material. The antibiofilm properties of ABR-MC were assessed using an exopolysaccharide-matrix-producing (EPS-matrix-producing) oral pathogen (Streptococcus mutans) in an experimental biofilm model. Using high-resolution confocal fluorescence imaging and biophysical methods, we observed remarkable disruption of bacterial accumulation and defective 3D matrix structure on the surface of ABR-MC. Specifically, the antibacterial composite impaired the ability of S. mutans to form organized bacterial clusters on the surface, resulting in altered biofilm architecture with sparse cell accumulation and reduced amounts of EPS matrix (versus control composite). Biofilm topology analyses on the control composite revealed a highly organized and weblike EPS structure that tethers the bacterial clusters to each other and to the surface, forming a highly cohesive unit. In contrast, such a structured matrix was absent on the surface of ABR-MC with mostly sparse and amorphous EPS, indicating disruption in the biofilm physical stability. Consistent with lack of structural organization, the defective biofilm on the surface of ABR-MC was readily detached when subjected to low shear stress, while most of the biofilm biomass remained on the control surface. Altogether, we demonstrate a new nonleachable antibacterial composite with excellent antibiofilm activity without affecting its mechanical properties, which may serve as a platform for development of alternative antifouling biomaterials.",0,497

Possible determinants of student QoL included demographics, fatigue, and social support. A stepwise multivariate analysis identified factors associated with changes of student QoL. Results: Among sources of support, the 'friends' category was the main position affecting their overall QoL, and 'significant other' had the strongest influence on psychological and social domains. The impact of support from friends on QoL was confirmed in the longitudinal analysis. Final regression models revealed that providing students with more social support and promoting fatigue reduction best improved medical student sense of well-being. Conclusion: Creating stronger student support programs to prevent social detachment and implementing strategies to reduce fatigue can improve QoL in medical students.

Cognitive training is one such strategy. In this article, we report a proof‐of‐concept study of a novel cognitive‐emotional training exercise designed to enhance cognitive control for emotional information processing and targeting components of the neural networks that have been implicated in MDD. Methods: Twenty‐one participants with MDD in a current episode were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions: 11 participating in a cognitive‐emotional training paradigm (emotional faces memory task (EFMT)) involving eight sessions over 4 weeks, and 10 participating in an active control condition (control training, CT). Assessments of MDD symptoms, negative affective bias in cognitive processing, and neurocognition (attention and working memory) were administered at baseline and after 4 weeks. Results: Participants in the EFMT group exhibited a greater reduction in MDD symptoms compared to the CT group, and 6 of the 11 EFMT participants achieved clinical response (≥50% reduction in symptoms). EFMT participants also exhibited changes in negative affective bias in the hypothesized direction whereas the CT participants did not. Both groups exhibited similar, small improvements in attention and working memory. Conclusions: Cognitive‐emotional training may represent a feasible and effective intervention strategy for MDD. This proof‐of‐concept study highlights the need for future studies to fully understand the effectiveness, and mechanisms of effect, of these training strategies.

An excessive use of the internet can have major consequences: loss of sleep time, worse working or school outcomes, progressive detachment from real relationships, isolation, loss of interest and irritability. The most widely used instrument to assess IA is the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), introduced by Kimberly Young; however, different factor structures were reported for the instrument. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of IA among 200 Italian university students (F = 100, M = 100; aged 19-40) using the IAT. Our findings indicate that the 9% (18 subjects) has a moderate risk to develop the IA, but no subjects obtained a test score between 80 and 100. The correct use of internet is present in the 23% of the sample (46 subjects), whereas the 68% (136 subjects) spend great amounts of time online. The collected data were analysed using the Italian two-factor structure model, according to Servidio et al. Our results confirm higher levels of problematic internet use in male than in female subjects and among young compared to older people. According to our results, however, the youth age is stronger than male gender in determining the level of problematic internet use. In addition, higher rates of problematic Internet use are present in young girls compared to old girls, while in male subjects the problematic internet use is independent from youth age or adulthood.

The modification of the SWNT walls with the mutant has been carried out in different buffer solutions, at pH 5, 7.5 and 9, to investigate the anchoring process, the typical chemical and physical properties of the component materials being dependent on the pH. The SWNTs modified by interactions with bacteriorhodopsin membrane patches have been characterized by UV-vis steady state, Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy. The investigation shows that the membrane protein patches wrap the carbon walls by tight chemical interactions undergoing a conformational change; such chemical interactions increase the mechanical strength of the SWNTs and promote charge transfers which p-dope the nano-objects. The functionalization, as well as the SWNT doping, is favoured in acid and basic buffer conditions; such buffers make the nanotube walls more reactive, thus catalysing the anchoring of the membrane protein.

Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to evaluate the effects of the vitrification. The chemical constitution of the material before and after the vitrification process was also analyzed. It was found that the vitrified product has an amorphous structure in which the components of asbestos-cement waste are incorporated. MIR spectroscopy showed that the absorption bands of chrysotile completely disappeared after the vitrification process. The results of the spectroscopic studies were confirmed by X-ray studies - no diffraction reflections from the chrysotile crystallographic planes were observed. As a result of the treatment, the fibrous asbestos construction, the main cause of its pathogenic properties, completely disappeared. The vitrified material was characterized by higher resistance to ion leaching in an aquatic environment than ACW and a smaller volume of nearly 72% in relation to the apparent volume of the substrates.

Understanding their organization can unveil vulnerabilities leading to potential treatments; spatially and temporally-resolved comprehensive experimental characterization can provide new details of biofilm formation, and possibly new targets for disease control. Here, biofilm formation of economically important phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa was analyzed at single-cell resolution using nanometer-resolution spectro-microscopy techniques, addressing the role of different types of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) at each stage of the entire bacterial life cycle. Single cell adhesion is caused by unspecific electrostatic interactions through proteins at the cell polar region, where EPS accumulation is required for more firmly-attached, irreversibly adhered cells. Subsequently, bacteria form clusters, which are embedded in secreted loosely-bound EPS, and bridged by up to ten-fold elongated cells that form the biofilm framework. During biofilm maturation, soluble EPS forms a filamentous matrix that facilitates cell adhesion and provides mechanical support, while the biofilm keeps anchored by few cells. This floating architecture maximizes nutrient distribution while allowing detachment upon larger shear stresses; it thus complies with biological requirements of the bacteria life cycle. Using new approaches, our findings provide insights regarding different aspects of the adhesion process of X. fastidiosa and biofilm formation.",0,506

BMC Psychiatry 17.","Background: Depressive symptoms are common in older adults. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and the availability of psychological treatments in primary care are limited. A behavioural approach to depression treatment might be beneficial to many older adults but such care is still largely unavailable. Behavioural Activation (BA) protocols are less complicated and more easy to train than other psychological therapies, making them very suitable for delivery by less specialised therapists. The recent introduction of the mental health nurse in primary care centres in the Netherlands has created major opportunities for improving the accessibility of psychological treatments for late-life depression in primary care. BA may thus address the needs of older patients while improving treatment outcome and lowering costs. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) for late-life depression in Dutch primary care. A secondary goal is to explore several potential mechanisms of change, as well as predictors and moderators of treatment outcome of BA for late-life depression. Methods/design: Cluster-randomised controlled multicentre trial with two parallel groups: a) behavioural activation, and b) treatment as usual, conducted in primary care centres with a follow-up of 52 weeks. The main inclusion criterion is a PHQ-9 score > 9. Patients are excluded from the trial in case of severe mental illness that requires specialized treatment, high suicide risk, drug and/or alcohol abuse, prior psychotherapy, change in dosage or type of prescribed antidepressants in the previous 12 weeks, or moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The intervention consists of 8 weekly 30-min BA sessions delivered by a trained mental health nurse. Discussion: We expect BA to be an effective and cost-effective treatment for late-life depression compared to TAU.

METHODS: Aldehyde substructures were integrated into starch via oxidative cleavage of vicinal diols by increasing amounts of sodium periodate followed by covalent attachment of cysteamine to oxidized starch via reductive amination. Thiol groups were quantified via Ellman's reaction and their impact on mucoadhesion was analyzed by rheological investigations, the rotating cylinder method and tensile studies on porcine mucosa. RESULTS: The total amount of immobilized thiol groups revealed a correlation between degree of oxidation and thiolation. Modified starch demonstrated an up to 1.66-fold increase in water uptake in comparison to native starch. Modification of starch resulted in greatly improved cohesive properties and improvement in mucoadhesion. Rheological investigations revealed a 2- to 4-fold rise in viscosity of mucus. Tensile studies revealed a linear correlation between degree of oxidation/thiolation and enhancement of maximum detachment force and total work adhesion. CONCLUSION: In terms of these results, thiolated starch is a new, promising, polymer in the field of mucoadhesive drug delivery systems.",0,508

Culture, Health & Sexuality 11(7","Reducing rates of teenage pregnancy is an important part of the agenda of action for meeting most of the Millenium Development Goals. South Africa has important lessons for other countries in this regard as the rate of teenage pregnancy is high but has declined very substantially over the last twenty years. The country experiences waves of moral panic about teenage pregnancy, with assertions that current problems are rooted in accepting or even encouraging the sexual appetites of young people rather than sternly disciplining them. In this paper, we argue that the key to success in teenage pregnancy reduction has been an empowering social policy agenda that has sought to work with young people, making them aware of their rights and the risks of sexual intercourse. Furthermore, family responses and education policy have greatly reduced the potential negative impact of teenage pregnancy on the lives of teenage girls. There is tremendous scope for further progress in reducing teenage pregnancy and we argue that this lies in paying more attention to issues of gender and sexuality, including the terms and conditions under which teenagers have sex. There needs to be critical reflection and engagement with men and boys on issues of masculinity, including their role in child rearing, as well as examination within families of their engagement with supporting pregnancy prevention and responses to pregnancies.",0,509

ACS applied materials & interfaces 10(11","Microwave absorption is a critical challenge with progression in electronics, where fine structural designing of absorbent materials plays an effective role in optimizing their microwave absorption properties. Here, we have developed Fe3O4@C (FC) and Fe-Fe3O4@C (FFC) hybrid nanorings via a hydrothermal method coupled with a chemical catalytic vapor deposition technique. FC and FFC hybrid nanorings have fine carbon coating while their size can easily be tunable in a certain range from 80-130 to 90-140 nm. The optimized FC and FFC hybrid nanorings bear minimum reflection loss (RL) values of -39.1 dB at 15.9 GHz and -32.9 dB at 17.1 GHz, respectively, whereas FFC shows an effective absorption bandwidth (RL values < -10 dB) ranged from 5.2 to 18 GHz. Such an enhanced microwave absorption performance of hybrid nanorings is mainly due to the suitable impedance characteristics, multilevel interfaces, and polarization features in nanorings. This work provides an approach to design hybrid materials having a complex structure to enhance the microwave absorption properties.",0,510

Analytical chemistry 88(18","In the present work, we first found that mercury ion (Hg(2+)) has an efficient quenching effect on the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI). Since we were inspired by this discovery, an aptamer-based ECL sensor was fabricated based on a Hg(2+) triggered signal switch coupled with an exonuclease I (Exo I)-stimulated target recycling amplification strategy for ultrasensitive determination of Hg(2+) and mucin 1 (MUC1). Concretely, the ECL intensity of ABEI-functionalized silver nanoparticles decorated graphene oxide nanocomposite (GO-AgNPs-ABEI) was initially enhanced by ferrocene labeled ssDNA (Fc-S1) (first signal switch ""on"" state) in the existence of H2O2. With the aid of aptamer, assistant ssDNA (S2) and full thymine (T) bases ssDNA (S3) modified Au nanoparticles (AuNPs-S2-S3) were immobilized on the sensing surface through the hybridization reaction. Then, via the strong and stable T-Hg(2+)-T interaction, an abundance of Hg(2+) was successfully captured on the AuNPs-S2-S3 and effectively inhibited the ECL reaction of ABEI (signal switch ""off"" state). Finally, the signal switch ""on"" state was executed by utilizing MUC1 as an aptamer-specific target to bind aptamer, leading to the large decrease of the captured Hg(2+). To further improve the sensitivity of the aptasensor, Exo I was implemented to digest the binded aptamer, which resulted in the release of MUC1 for achieving target recycling with strong detectable ECL signal even in a low level of MUC1. By integrating the quenching effect of Hg(2+) to reduce the background signal and target recycling for signal amplification, this proposed ECL aptasensor was successfully used to detect Hg(2+) and MUC1 sensitively with a wide linear response.",0,511

Here, we present a rational design and construction of well-organized macro-mesoporous nanostructure toward robust high-performance self-cleaning antireflective thin films on the basis of effective medium theory and finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations that combine the optical design principle. A hierarchical macro-mesoporous SiO2 thin film with very high porosity and gradient refractive indexes works as a λ/4-wavelength AR layer and significantly suppresses the reflection in the range from 350 to 1200 nm. Even after dip-coating a layer of high refractive index TiO2 nanocrystals, the nanostructured thin film still exhibits broadband AR properties which are much superior to conventional flat SiO2/TiO2 thin films, especially in the range of 350-500 nm. In addition, the obtained thin film exhibits photocatalytic self-cleaning and durable superhydrophilicity. The advantages brought by the well-organized macro-mesoporous structure are also testified through comparing to the solely mesoporous SiO2/TiO2 film counterpart. Moreover, the pencil hardness test and sandpaper abrasion test show favorable robustness and functional durability of the thin film, which make it extremely attractive for practical applications in optical devices, display devices, and photovoltaic cells.",0,512

The system is based on an imaging spectrometer and a charged coupled device (CCD) detector and includes 12 fiber-optic probes with a novel dual-path design. UV light was produced by a small arc deuterium lamp illuminating an optical fiber bundle. Twelve fiber-optic dipping probes were constructed with a reflection geometry. A 5 mm diameter lens was used to achieve a parallel light beam. The light passed back and forth through the flow-through cuvette defined by a sapphire window and a coated aluminium mirror. The mirror was cut in half and each segment was tilted and set at different distances from the window to obtain two separate paths with different lengths. Two receiver fibers were used for each probe to collect the transmitted light. The 24 receiver fibers from the 12 probes were bunched to a linear bundle and fed to an imaging spectrometer and the corresponding spectra were detected with a 512 x 512 pixel cooled CCD detector. The sampling interval was typically a few seconds for all probes. A software package was developed for data recording and on-line analysis. The program includes tools for multi-component analysis. The system was tested for different tablet formulations. Prednisone 50 mg tablets, normally used for control tests of dissolution baths, were followed for 3 h. Secondly, an extended release low dosage tablet was followed for 7 h resulting in a linear dissolution profile. Finally, a combination tablet containing two active drugs was tested for 60 min profiles. In the latter case, separate dissolution curves for the two active components were obtained.

The 'Living with a parent who has . . .' section includes five/seven chapters sharing coping strategies; likely encounters with the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or the mental illnesses of schizophrenia, major depression, and bi-polar disorder; and resource identification for self-management, detachment, and support for the parent. The 'Wrap-Up' section includes three chapters that are summaries of the 'lessons,' specific resource information, and other 'last words' of encouragement. Each of these books offers many options for the worker or therapist of a teen, family, or individual suffering from PTSD, schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder.

The aim of this work is to shed light on the most favorable doped structures by comparing our results with previously published experimental data. The calculated relative energies, ranging between 0.8 and 10 meV per atom, indicate that several doped Ag29-xAux nanoclusters are likely to co-exist at room temperature. However, only the Au-doped [Ag29-xAux(BDT)12(TPP)4]3- nanoclusters that have direct bonding between Au dopants and phosphines display an enhancement in the electronic transitions at ∼450 nm. This agrees with the main spectral absorption features that have been experimentally reported for the mixture of Au-doped silver Ag29-xAux nanoclusters. In addition, the formation of the Au-TPP bond could prevent cluster degradation starting from the detachment of the phosphine molecules, since the Au-TPP bond is stronger by ∼0.4 eV than the analogous Ag-TPP one.

Psychiatria Danubina 29(Suppl 3","Introduction: The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood. Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones, based both on the anatomic transformation of his/her own body and on the social expectation according to the identity. The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years (Franzoni et al. 2012). Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into predictive factors of a psychopathology. We need to build our body image over time; changing our perception of reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we strive for changes (Bianchini 2008). Method: 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10 and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school. Results: The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15 years the concern for the body shape is already present, without difference between the genders. Although 45% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Rating Scale test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with moderate gravity. Discussion: Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted. Conclusion: The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched. It would be appreciated if we could introduce in the school, in the program of different subjects, the discussion regarding different aspects of a healthy nutrition and the formation of a solid self-esteem in order, for the students, to have a critical interpretation of the media message on food, body and beauty. It is desirable to promote the emancipation of the adolescents from a condition of dependence to discover their own place in the world. The educative action can help developing the research of the meaning of the own personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,522

A circular dichroic response in reflection as large as ∼0.5 is experimentally observed in a near-infrared wavelength band. By imaging a fabricated pattern composed of the enantiomeric unit cells, we directly visualize the two key features of our engineered meta-mirrors, namely the chiral-selective absorption and the polarization preservation upon reflection.

More than 500 published 100%-yield, solid-state reactions in 25 reaction types cover virtually all fields of synthetic organic chemistry. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that solid-state reactions require long-range molecular movements and are strictly and sensibly guided by the crystal packing. Three steps govern the issue: phase rebuilding, phase transformation, and crystal disintegration (detachment). If one of these fails, or if liquid phases are not avoided, the reaction will usually not run to completion. Repeated creation of fresh contacts of crystallites is essential in solid-solid reactions. New, otherwise inaccessible and highly reactive products are most easily obtained. Cooling below eutectic temperatures, but also thermal activation above room temperature, may be necessary. Liquids may be solidified by cooling or inclusion complexation.

Vitis riparia, widely used in rootstock and scion breeding, has been studied in isolated leaf drying response studies; however, it is essential to identify key root and shoot water deficit signaling traits in intact plants. This information will aid improved scion and rootstock selection and management practices in grapevine. RNAseq data were generated from V. riparia roots and shoots under water deficit and well-watered conditions to determine root signaling and shoot responses to water deficit. RESULTS: Shoot elongation, photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance were significantly reduced in water deficit (WD) treated than in well-watered grapevines. RNAseq analysis indicated greater transcriptional differences in shoots than in roots under WD, with 6925 and 1395 genes differentially expressed, respectively (q-value < 0.05). There were 50 and 25 VitisNet pathways significantly enriched in WD relative to well-watered treatments in grapevine shoots and roots, respectively. The ABA biosynthesis genes beta-carotene hydroxylase, zeaxanthin epoxidase, and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases were up-regulated in WD root and WD shoot. A positive enrichment of ABA biosynthesis genes and signaling pathways in WD grapevine roots indicated enhanced root signaling to the shoot. An increased frequency of differentially expressed reactive oxygen species scavenging (ROS) genes were found in the WD shoot. Analyses of hormone signaling genes indicated a strong ABA, auxin, and ethylene network and an ABA, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm network in both WD shoot and WD root. CONCLUSIONS: This work supports previous findings in detached leaf studies suggesting ABA-responsive binding factor 2 (ABF2) is a central regulator in ABA signaling in the WD shoot. Likewise, ABF2 may have a key role in V. riparia WD shoot and WD root. A role for ABF3 was indicated only in WD root. WD shoot and WD root hormone expression analysis identified strong ABA, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm signaling networks. These results present the first ABA, cytokinin, and circadian rhythm signaling network in roots under water deficit. These networks point to organ specific regulators that should be explored to further define the communication network from soil to shoot.",0,536

Nano letters 17(10","Wavefront manipulation in metasurfaces typically relies on phase mapping with a finite number of elements. In particular, a discretized linear phase profile may be used to obtain a beam bending functionality. However, discretization limits the applicability of this approach for high angle bending due to the drastic efficiency drop when the phase is mapped by a small number of elements. In this work, we discuss a novel concept for energy redistribution in diffraction gratings and its application in the visible spectrum range, which helps overcome the constraints of ultrahigh angle (above 80°) beam bending. Arranging asymmetric dielectric nanoantennas into diffractive gratings, we show that one can efficiently redistribute the power between the grating orders at will. This is achieved by precise engineering of the scattering pattern of the nanoantennas. The concept is numerically and experimentally demonstrated at visible frequencies using several designs of TiO2 (titanium dioxide) nanoantennas for medium (∼55°) and high (∼80°) angle light bending. Results show efficient broadband visible-light operation (blue and green range) of transmissive devices, reaching efficiencies of ∼90% and 50%, respectively, at the optimized wavelength.

This study proposes the independent and combined use of ultrasonic waves and chemical agents for the treatment of already damaged core samples caused by exposure to distilled water. Results elucidate that ultrasonic waves with optimum (20kHz, 1000W) instead of maximum frequency and power worked well in the recovery owing to peristaltic transport caused by matching of natural frequency with acoustic waves frequency. In addition, hundred minutes was investigated as optimum irradiation time which provided ample time span to detach fine loosely suspended particles. However, further irradiation adversely affected the damaged permeability recovery. Moreover, permeability improvement attributes to cavitation due to ultrasonic waves propagation through fluid contained in porous medium and thermal energy generated by three different ways. Eventually, experimental outcomes indicated that maximum (25.3%) damaged permeability recovery was witnessed by applying ultrasonic waves with transducer #2 (20kHz and 1000W) and optimum irradiation timeframe (100min).

Edward Fried's extensional mereological account of the human body is taken as representative of a prominent strand in analytic metaphysics that has close affinities with medical positivism. I show why such accounts fail. First, I consider how Fried attempts to make sense of the medical case of Barney Clark, the first recipient of an artificial heart, and show that his analytic metaphysical categories do not have the right kind of fit with the case. A proper medical metaphysic should involve a richer two way dialogue with medicine, and it should not just ""apply"" formal accounts worked out in other settings. Second, I argue that any effort to account for real wholes with extensional mereological sums requires all sorts of ad hoc, supplementary mechanisms that do the real work, and the full repertoire of these mechanisms involves inconsistencies and semantic shifts. Finally, I consider an alternative strand of work on non-extensional whole/part relations that is closer to medicine and that can deepen reflection on some core problems in bioethics, for example, associated with the determination of death when an organism ceases to function as a whole. In addition to the utility such formal ontologies have for addressing traditional problems such as the determination of death, philosophers of medicine should appreciate the increasingly influential role such formal tools are playing in the development of data system ontologies. Assumptions integral to these ontologies have far reaching implications for the way future research and practice in medicine will be conducted, and much greater critical reflection is needed on the full range of issues associated with the development and use of such medical ontologies.",0,541

Follow-up angiography was performed before the rabbits were killed at 2 (n = 7), 6 (n = 9), 10 (n = 8), or 26 (n = 11) weeks. Angiographic occlusion was scored according to the Raymond scale, and interval changes were assessed. The harvested aneurysms were evaluated on histologic examination. From the sections, we determined the percentage of the sac excluded from the vasculature and occupied by embolic devices by using image analysis. We compared results using the analysis of variance/t test or chi(2) test.RESULTSThe mean number of devices used to treat aneurysms in the PPG-B group was significantly greater than that used for the other 2 groups, though aneurysm volumes were similar among groups. Compared with immediate posttreatment occlusion scores, mean angiographic occlusion at follow-up was increased for all 3 hydrogel filament groups. On histologic examination, thrombus organization, neointima formation, and inflammation were similar to that observed in rabbit experimental aneurysms with other embolic devices containing platinum coils.CONCLUSIONSThe embolization of experimental aneurysms with hydrogel filaments resulted in durable angiographic and histologic occlusion from 2 to 26 weeks.

Six aneurysms were embolized as completely as possible, and 6 aneurysms were embolized incompletely to intentionally leave remnants. Three aneurysms in each group underwent follow-up at 4 and 13 weeks. DSA, MRA, and CTA were performed immediately before sacrifice. The harvested aneurysms were evaluated histologically. For each imaging technique, the areas of the embolic mass and remnant were determined by using image analysis. Results were compared by using paired t tests.RESULTSCTAs were suitable for quantification of the embolus and remnant areas because only small streaking artifacts were evident. The areas of the embolus were larger on CTA compared with DSA and histologic sections. The areas of the remnant were larger on CTA and MRA compared with DSA and histologic sections. Like DSA and MRA, CTA was suitable for determining whether aneurysm retreatment was necessary, provided that loops of hydrogel filaments were not present in the parent artery.CONCLUSIONSWe demonstrated that CTA is a technique with potential for surveillance of aneurysms treated with hydrogel filaments.

Generally, biocompatible and nontoxic poly(ethylene glycol) surface modification (PEGylation) can enhance NLC stability, although this may impair drug delivery and NLC clearance. To attain RIPL-NLC steric stabilization without impairing function, pH-sensitive cleavable PEG (cPEG) was grafted onto RIPL-NLCs (cPEG-RIPL-NLCs). Methods: Various types of NLC formulations including RIPL-NLCs, PEG-RIPL-NLCs, and cPEG-RIPL-NLCs were prepared using the solvent emulsification-evaporation method and characterized for particle size, zeta potential (ZP), and cytotoxicity. The steric stabilization effect was evaluated by plasma protein adsorption and phagocytosis inhibition studies. pH-sensitive cleavage was investigated using the dialysis method under different pH conditions. Employing a fluorescent probe (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate [DiI]), in vitro drug delivery capacity of the cPEG-RIPL-NLCs under different pH conditions was also performed on Hpn-expressing SKOV3 cells and 3D-tumor spheroids. Results: All prepared NLCs showed homogenous dispersion (<220 nm in size) with a negative ZP (-18 to -22 mV), except for positively charged RIPL-NLCs (~10 mV), revealing no significant cytotoxicity in either SKOV3 or RAW 264.7 cell lines. cPEG-RIPL-NLC protein adsorption was 1.75-fold less than that of RIPL-NLCs, and PEGylation significantly reduced the macrophage uptake. PEG detachment from the cPEG-RIPL-NLCs was pH-sensitive and time dependent. At 2 hours incubation, cPEG-RIPL-NLCs and PEG-RIPL-NLCs exhibited comparable cellular uptake at pH 7.4, whereas cPEG-RIPL-NLC uptake was increased over 2-fold at pH 6.5. 3D-spheroid penetration also demonstrated pH-sensitivity: at pH 7.4, cPEG-RIPL-NLCs could not penetrate deep into the spheroid core region during 2 hours, whereas at pH 6.5, high fluorescence intensity in the core region was observed for both cPEG-RIPL-NLC-and RIPL-NLC-treated groups.

Despite a great deal of research and investigation since the initial description of ARDS 30 years ago many questions about the pathogenesis, treatment and outcome of the disease remain unanswered. Although there is evidence to suggest that outcome of ALI and ARDS is improving, the reasons why are unknown and there is not yet a well developed treatment for these diseases. Inhalation injury resulting from exposure to pyrolysis and combustion atmospheres is among the causes of ALI/ARDS. Little is known of the mechanisms of fire related inhalation injury that results in the development of ALI/ARDS. There is a paucity of information about fire atmosphere exposure response relationships for smoke-induced inhalation injury. Although there is considerable information about the pulmonary toxicity of many of the more common constituents of fire atmospheres, little is known about the pulmonary toxicity of mixtures of these constituents.

Psychiatriki 28(4","Forgivingness occupies a prominent place in religions as well as in various philosophical systems of ethics and can be defined as the free, personal distancing from feelings of rage and resentment toward a person or persons having committed an injustice. The main psychological function of forgiveness consists in allowing for the replacement of negative emotions by positive ones, such as generosity, goodness, compassion, empathy, or even love toward the offender. It must be emphasized that forgiveness is independent from reconciliation, and it is not simply a form of tolerance, justification, oblivion, underestimation, denial or amnesty. Intrapsychic processes are sufficient and necessary for the genesis of forgiveness, although it is likely that these are also influenced by complex interpersonal events. Current research identifies various dimensions of forgiveness, which must be distinguished from each other, as they differ both on the level of causes, as well as on that of effects. The observation that forgiveness has a positive effect on mental health is not new, it is, however, only recently that comprehensive theories have been constructed and scientific research has been developed regarding the relationship between forgiveness and psychopathology. Over the recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies affirming the beneficial effects of forgiveness on a broad spectrum of aspects of mental health and well-being, despite the lack of complete clarification of underlying mechanisms. The positive connection between forgiveness and mental health could be mediated through direct or indirect mechanisms interacting not only on a biological level, but also in the psychological and social realm of human existence. One direct way could be the avoidance of ruminative thoughts reinforcing and maintaining negative emotions such as resentment, hatred, anger, anxiety and fear. Moreover, forgiveness cultivates empathy and promotes altruistic forms of behavior, facilitating the preservation of relationships and protecting from prolonged distress. An indirect mechanism could involve various forms of health behavior, interpersonal functionality and social supportive networks, factors universally accepted as contributing to mental health. Owing to the positive influence of forgiveness on health issues, various modes of intervention have been proposed and implemented using forgiveness either independently or from within the conceptual framework of specific psychotherapeutic methods. The aim of these interventions is to express negative emotions, to liberate the subject from the vicious circle of rumination, and to overcome resentment in a positive way. Thus, there is an obvious need to further promote forgivingness as a subject of psychological and psychiatric research, and to foreground findings and possible clinical psychotherapeutic applications.

Previous research indicates that when individuals experience difficulty managing these emotions, burnout may result. Aboriginal health care workers often have roles with large emotional demands, as they are relied upon heavily to engage clients in care. However, the concept of emotional labour has received little attention in relation to this group. AIM: To explore potential sources of emotional labour for Aboriginal Maternal Infant Care workers in a maternity care program for Aboriginal women in South Australia. The program involves these workers providing care for women in partnership with midwives. METHODS: We employed a phenomenological approach. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted with staff and clients of the program. Recorded interviews were transcribed and coded and emerging themes identified. FINDINGS: This workforce undertakes extensive emotional labour. Key sources include the cultural and family obligations they have to clients, complex social needs of many clients, and potential for community backlash when poor perinatal outcomes occur.

CONCLUSION: This study found that the responsibilities inherent to the role as both cultural broker and carer create significant emotional labour for workers. Recommendations to address this and enhance the sustainability of this workforce include: recognition and valuing of emotional work by management and other staff, enhancing cultural awareness training, and building stress-relieving activities into the workplace.",0,551

Transcultural Psychiatry began in 1956 as a newsletter published by the McGill Division of Social & Transcultural Psychiatry. The first issue featured reports based on surveys conducted by the McGill Division on cross cultural variations in depressive symptomatology and the relationship between social cohesion and depression. The summaries, mainly written by the editors, were based on mimeo graphed or type script papers that were not widely available. Some reviews were of articles that had appeared in other journals, but included critical analysis that gave them added value. The journal became an arena for discussion and debate on the place of culture in mental health and illness and leading figures in cultural psychiatry, psychological anthropology, and allied disciplines contributed to this exchange. Transcultural Psychiatry has played a central role in consolidating a field that is inherently interdisciplinary and the journal continues to provide a place for very different methods and perspectives to meet, peacefully coexist, and, at times, cross fertilize. Transcultural Psychiatry, therefore,must include ongoing efforts at self critical reflection. The journal reflects about creative work advancing a psychiatry that fully respects the social grounding of human experience in health and illness.

Ultrasonics 77: 54-60.","The use of energy harvesting for powering wireless sensors is made more challenging in most applications by the requirement for customization to each specific application environment because of specificities of the available energy form, such as precise location, direction and motion frequency, as well as the temporal variation and unpredictability of the energy source. Wireless power transfer from dedicated sources can overcome these difficulties, and in this work, the use of targeted ultrasonic power transfer as a possible method for remote powering of sensor nodes is investigated. A powering system for pipeline monitoring sensors is described and studied experimentally, with a pair of identical, non-inertial piezoelectric transducers used at the transmitter and receiver. Power transmission of 18mW (Root-Mean-Square) through 1m of a118mm diameter cast iron pipe, with 8mm wall thickness is demonstrated. By analysis of the delay between transmission and reception, including reflections from the pipeline edges, a transmission speed of 1000m/s is observed, corresponding to the phase velocity of the L(0,1) axial and F(1,1) radial modes of the pipe structure. A reduction of power delivery with water-filling is observed, yet over 4mW of delivered power through a fully-filled pipe is demonstrated. The transmitted power and voltage levels exceed the requirements for efficient power management, including rectification at cold-starting conditions, and for the operation of low-power sensor nodes. The proposed powering technique may allow the implementation of energy autonomous wireless sensor systems for monitoring industrial and network pipeline infrastructure.",0,553

We have previously demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) can be tethered to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates and that these surfaces promoted interactions with human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. The goal of the current work was to better understand the specific effects of the tethered growth factor on the cells. The EGF was reacted with a homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivative, and then bound to allyamine plasma-modified PDMS. Human corneal epithelial cells were seeded on the surfaces and cultured in serum-free medium for periods of up to 5 days. Cell growth was monitored and quantified by trypsinization and counting with a Coulter counter. Expression of matrix proteins and alpha(6)-integrins was assessed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. A centrifugation assay was used to determine cell adhesion under an applied detachment force. Binding of EGF was found to significantly increase cell numbers and coverage across the surfaces at 5 days of culture in vitro. Immunofluorescence experiments indicate increased expression of fibronectin, laminin, and alpha(6)-integrins on the EGF-modified surfaces, and expression is localized at the cell-material interface as observed by confocal microscopy. In accordance with these results, the highest quantity of adherent cells is found on the EGF-modified subtrates at 5 days of culture. The results provide initial evidence that binding of EGF may be used to improve the epithelialization of and the adhesion of the cells on a polymeric artificial cornea device.",0,554

DESIGN: Clinical case report. METHODS: A 56-year-old man reported a 3-day history of visual impairment and scotoma in the right eye. An ophthalmoscopic examination, visual field test, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography, and systemic evaluation were performed. RESULTS: Fundus examination showed multiple nevus-like uveal pigmented lesions bilaterally. Optical coherence tomography showed a subfoveal serous retinal detachment and focal loss of the retinal pigment epithelium with adjacent areas of retinal pigment epithelial thickening in the right eye, explaining the scotoma on the visual field examination. Indocyanine green angiography showed multiple round areas of hypofluorescence corresponding to the nevus-like pigmented tumors seen on funduscopy, and retinal pigment epithelium damage corresponding to hypoautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging and window defects points seen on fluorescein angiography bilaterally. After bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation diagnosis, a systemic workup showed clear cell carcinoma in the left kidney. Owing to the tumoral size, chemotherapy was administered. CONCLUSION: Renal carcinoma associated with bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation is rare, and the patterns observed in the ancillary examinations, including indocyanine green angiography, are useful for early-stage diagnosis and immediate referral for systemic investigation and treatment.",0,555

Toxicology and applied pharmacology 329: 121-127.","Current in vitro approaches to cardiac safety testing typically focus on mechanistic ion channel testing to predict in vivo proarrhythmic potential. Outside of the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative, structural and functional cardiotoxicity related to chronic dosing effects are of great concern as these effects can impact compound attrition. Development and implementation of an in vitro cardiotoxicity screening platform that effectively identifies these liabilities early in the discovery process should reduce costly attrition and decrease preclinical development time. Impedence platforms have the potential to accurately identify structural and functional cardiotoxicity and have sufficient throughput to be included in a multi-parametric optimization approach. Human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hIPSC-CMs) have demonstrated utility in cardiac safety and toxicity screening. The work described here leverages these advantages to assess the predictive value of data generated by two impedance platforms. The response of hIPSC-CMs to compounds with known or predicted cardiac functional or structural toxicity was determined. The compounds elicited cardiac activities and/or effects on ""macro"" impedance often associated with overt structural or cellular toxicity, detachment, or hypertrophy. These assays correctly predicted in vivo cardiotox findings for 81% of the compounds tested and did not identify false positives. In addition, internal or literature Cmax values from in vivo studies correlated within 4 fold of the in vitro observations. The work presented here demonstrates the predictive power of impedance platforms with hIPSC-CMs and provides a means toward accelerating lead candidate selection by assessing preclinical cardiac safety earlier in the drug discovery process.",0,556

Twelve metal coils coated with simvastatin and 12 bare coils were inserted into the ligated external carotid arterial (ECA) sacs of rats. The ECA sacs were removed 2 or 4 weeks after the coils were implanted and examined by histology and immunohistochemical assay.

We predict that above v = 10(4) nm/s the additional force-induced intermediate state is populated at an end-to-end extension of about 75 Å. The force-induced switch in the unfolding pathway occurs at the critical pulling speed v(crit) ≈ 10(6)-10(7) nm/s. We argue that this critical pulling speed is an upper limit of the interval where Bell's theory works. However, our results suggest that the Go-model fails to reproduce the experimentally observed mechanical unfolding pathway properly, yielding an incomplete picture of the free energy landscape. Surprisingly, the experimentally observed intermediate state with the A strand detached is not populated in Go-model simulations over a wide range of pulling speeds.

Animals were allocated into 1 of 3 groups: (1) repair alone (controls, n = 32), (2) repair augmented by application of an osteoconductive calcium-phosphate (Ca-P) matrix only (n = 32), or (3) repair augmented with Ca-P matrix + TGF-β(3) (2.75 µg) at the tendon-bone interface (n = 32).

Microcomputed tomography was utilized to quantitate bone microstructure at the repair site. The healing tendon-bone interface was evaluated with histomorphometry and immunohistochemical localization of collagen types I (COLI) and III (COLIII). Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way analysis of variance with significance set at P < .05.RESULTSThere was significantly greater load to failure of the Ca-P matrix + TGF-β(3) group compared with matrix alone or untreated controls at 4 weeks postoperatively (P = .04). At 2 weeks, microcomputed tomography revealed a larger volume of newly formed bone present at the healing enthesis in both experimental groups compared with the control group.

Magnetic interactions, accessible spin states, and (55)Mn isotropic hyperfine couplings are computed with quantum chemical methods and form the basis for structure-property correlations. Additionally, the effects of oxo-bridge protonation and one-electron reduction are examined. The calculated properties are found to be in excellent agreement with available experimental data. It is established that all synthetic and model Mn(IV)3CaO4 cubane complexes have the same high-spin S = (9)/2 ground state. The magnetic coupling conditions under which different ground spin states can be accessed are determined. Substitution of Mn(IV) magnetic centers by diamagnetic ions [e.g., Ge(IV)] allows one to ""switch off"" specific spin sites in order to examine the magnetic orbitals along individual Mn-Mn exchange pathways, which confirms the predominance of ferromagnetic interactions within the cubane framework. The span of the Heisenberg spin ladder is found to correlate inversely with the number of protonated oxo bridges. Energetic comparisons for protonated models show that the tris-μ-oxo bridge connecting only Mn ions in the cubane has the lowest proton affinity and that the average relaxation energy per additional proton is on the order of 18 kcal·mol(-1), thus making access to ground states other than the high-spin S = (9)/2 state in these cubanes unlikely.

In addition, the differences in the level of burnout in firefighters were evaluated within the three of meaning in life. Method: Participants were 189 firefighters randomly recruited from 12 fire stations in southern Poland; they participated in the study voluntarily. The age range was 20–50 years (mean 33.04 years, SD = 7.87). The following questionnaires were used: the Personal Meaning Profile, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: Firefighters with higher levels of personal meaning and presence of meaning reported less emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and more personal accomplishment. Most of the personal meaning dimensions also had significant associations with burnout indicators: individuals with detached style had higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization than individuals with presence style and presence and search style. Discussion: Meaning structures are an important salutary factor that enables firefighters to effectively comprehend and interpret their work-related experiences, and thus reduces the likelihood of distress and weariness they experience. Search for meaning has beneficial effects on burnout consequences among firefighters only if it is linked with presence of meaning. Conclusions: Having valuable goals and purpose in life endows individuals with meaningful experiences that form the building blocks of meaning in life that neutralize the processes and effects of burnout.

Using differential scanning calorimetry we revealed a stepwise disassembly of PSI supercomplex above 50°C. Circular dichroism, sucrose gradient centrifugation and 77K fluorescence experiments identified the sequence of events of PSI destabilization: 3min heating at 60°C or 40min white light illumination at 25°C resulted in pronounced Lhca1/4 detachment from the PSI supercomplex, which is then followed by the degradation of Lhca2/3. The similarity of the main structural effects due to heat and light treatments supports the notion that thermo-optic mechanism, structural changes induced by ultrafast local thermal transients, which has earlier been shown to be responsible for structural changes in the antenna system of photosystem II, can also regulate the assembly and functioning of PSI antenna.",0,573

Rofo 190(8","BACKGROUND: Lower urinary tract fistulas are currently a rather rare, but severe condition associated with considerable morbidity. Treatment is challenging, especially in fistulas caused by pelvic malignancy or radiation therapy. Surgical treatment attempts fail in a considerable number of patients, especially in those with pelvic malignancies/prior radiation therapy or are precluded altogether due to severe comorbidity. For such patients percutaneous approaches can provide alternative treatment. METHOD: This review is based on case studies and case reports dealing with percutaneous treatment options of lower urinary tract fistulas and leakages from the past four decades (1979 - 2017). The included techniques were ureteral fulguration, tissue adhesive-based embolization, non-detachable and detachable balloon occlusion, ureteral coiling, ureteral clipping, silicone or nylon plug as well as modified vascular plug embolization. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Percutaneous treatment options of lower urinary tract fistulas and leakages allow for either permanent or temporary, instant ureteral occlusion. In general, transrenal ureteral occlusion is a safe and reliable alternative to surgical treatment of ureteral fistulas and leakages. So far, no technique has been proven to be superior to the others. Depending on the underlying disease, the optimal percutaneous technique may vary and should be chosen according to the individual needs of the patients. KEY POINTS: . Patients with therapy-refractory urerteral fistulas may benefit from transrenal ureteral occlusion.. . Transrenal ureteral occlusion allows for long-term symptom relief.. .

The influence of varying current density on morphological, structural, optical and electrical properties of PS samples were analyzed by using SEM, AFM, XRD, FT-IR, PL and electrical (I-V) techniques, respectively. Microstructural images clearly showed that the average pore diameter and thickness increase with increase current densities up to 100mA/cm(2) and decrease for 125mA/cm(2). It could be related to breaking of pore walls and exposing to the next layer of c-Si. Further increase the current density about 150mA/cm(2), the average pore diameter increase as in the case of first layer (40-100mA/cm(2)) of c-Si wafer. The result is reflected in PL emission band (at 708nm) and the intensity of the emission band shifted towards red region. The X-ray diffraction pattern confirm the formation of porous silicon as appeared as a broad peak at 2θ=69.3° belongs to (400) reflection. The FTIR study supports the X-ray diffraction analysis that shows the vibrational bands of S-H2 and Si-O-Si at 2109cm(-1), 915cm(-1) and 615cm(-1) and 1107cm(-1), respectively. The I-V characteristic of PS exhibited rectifying behavior with different values of ideality factor (η) and barrier height (ϕb). It is concluded from the experimental results that the formed pores developed up to 100mA/cm(2) in the top layer of c-Si and the formed pores exposed to the next layer of c-Si when increase the high electrochemical etching process (above 100mA/cm(2)).",0,575

The minimum energy ""zero Kelvin"" structure found for any 4-water (or larger) anion cluster, at any post-Hartree–Fock theory level, is very similar to a recently reported embedded-DFT-in-classical-water-MD simulation (Uhlig, Marsalek, and Jungwirth, J.

The minimum calculation with just four water molecules does a remarkably good job of reproducing the resonance Raman properties, the radius of gyration derived from the optical spectrum, the vertical detachment energy, and the hydration free energy. For the first time we also successfully calculate the EPR g-factor and (low temperature ice) hyperfine couplings.

Synergetic microwave absorption in carbon globules embedded with nanoscale iron/iron-carbide graphite (FeC) particles via dielectric, magnetic and Ohmic losses is emphasized in this work. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties of the FeC nanoparticles dispersed in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are studied in the 8-18 GHz frequency range and compared with those of PVDF composites containing similar weight fractions of conducting/magnetic phase micro-particles such as carbonyl iron (CI) or electrolytic iron (EI) or a similar amount of amorphous carbon phase such as amorphous carbon (a-C) globules. The PVDF/FeC composite shows a maximum SET value of -23.9 dB at 18 GHz, as compared to the SET for the other composites. The enhanced EMI shielding in the PVDF/FeC composite is attributed to the increased interfaces of the nanoscale particles, which facilitate enhanced Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization. The homogenous dispersion of iron and iron-carbide phases in the carbon matrix of the FeC sample enhances the interfacial polarization and multiple internal scattering of the penetrated EM waves, which get synergistically attenuated by the Ohmic, magnetic and dielectric losses. Based on complex permittivity and permeability results we have calculated the Reflection Loss (RL) of the PVDF/FeC composite. The PVDF-FeC composite shows a RL peak of -40.5 dB for a 4.3 mm thick specimen positioned at 5 GHz frequency. The RL peak is explained using the quarter-wave cancellation model. Our work demonstrates that incorporating carbon globules containing nanoscale magnetic and conducting particles in a polymer matrix, provides an effective way to enhance EMI shielding via absorption of the EM wave in a lightweight thin composite coating.",0,578

It motivates students to work in a collaborative manner with frequent opportunities for feedback, reflection, and modification of their ideas. Each laboratory activity has four stages to keep the students' efforts on track: pre-lab work, an in-lab discussion, in-lab work, and a post-lab assignment. Students are guided at each stage by an instructor created template that directs their learning while giving them the opportunity and flexibility to explore new information, ideas, and questions. These templates are easily transferred into an electronic journal (termed the E-notebook) and form the basic structural framework of the final lab reports the students submit electronically, via a learning management system. The guided-inquiry based approach presented here uses a single laboratory activity for undergraduate Introductory Biochemistry as an example.

Health administrations, therefore, are called to improve the performance through a better motivation and satisfaction of the staff, in view of two strategic aspects: job satisfaction of professionals and team collaboration.METHODBetween January and September 2014, a survey at the OU (UUOO) intensive care and sub intensive has been made inside three hospitals in Emilia Romagna. It' s been a multicentre cross-sectional quantitative study by administering a self-report questionnaire designed to investigate the different constructs. On 742 questionnaires were spread 454 professionals gave it back  (response rate = 73%). Of those, 273 (60.1%) were nurses, 119 (26.2%) were physicians and 62 (13.7%) were healthcare operators. 62 (13.7%) Job Satisfaction was measured with the McCloskey Mueller Satisfaction Scale. Team Functioning was measured with the Index of Interprofessional Team Collaboration.RESULTSResults from MANOVA indicated that physicians were less satisfied of scheduling than both nurses and healthcare operators. For professional opportunities, instead, healthcare operators showed the lower level of satisfaction. The participants seem to perceive a high level of team effectiveness and therefore the professionals involved in the care of critically ill patients than the two dimensions analysed, (reflection between the processes and interdependent roles), also state a greater tendency to respect the roles interdisciplinary, maintaining their professional autonomy and a lower tendency to use critical thinking to act professionally in order to improve the effectiveness of care provided.CONCLUSIONThe study results oriented healthcare administrators, to take paths that feed the job satisfaction and the collaboration of professionals by developing the aspects investigated. Considering the shared perception among the professions studied, compared to the constructs under investigation, it seems to be clear how the routes should be designed in a systematic order to involve, in an integrated way the best professionals (nurses, doctors and OSS) involved in taking managing critical patients.

Psychiatriki 15(1","Cancer, a life-threatening disease, is still accompanied by a strange and unjust mythology, despite the significant progress of the current oncology treatment. Liaison Psychiatry in Oncology has an accepted place at the table within the oncology community. The educational function of Liaison Psychiatry in an oncology hospital is one of its most significant activities, in combination with the clinical and research work, and its objective is the incorporation of psychosocial guidelines to the total care of a patient. Training of non-psychiatric staff is of great importance to Liaison Psychiatry and has as its main purpose to focus the interest of the oncology staff on the patients quality of life, on the psychosocial problems that arise to patients that are under active treatment or palliative care and also to draw attention on the humanistic, moral and spiritual values of patient care. The educational contribution of nonpsychiatric staff is focused especially on the relationship between patient/doctor/nurse staff. The diagnostic consultation and the communication in the doctor/patient relationship is an issue of major publication relevance and educational efforts. During the course of the doctor/patient relationship, both patient and doctor are in a difficult emotional status. For the patient, the fear of death itself is conceived in various forms, such as fear for the unknown, for the potential losses, or for the listlessness and the dependence he/she would experience. For the doctor, the possibility of death of his/her patient can cause guilt and hostility because of unconscious feelings of impotence and the need for loving. These complicated feelings of stress, anger and guilt can develop behaviours of detachment that make diagnostic consultancy and communication in doctor/patient relationship extremely difficult. During the recent years, following the increased educational experience in oncology hospitals and the understanding of the difficulties that arise during the training of non-psychiatric staff, various liaison services started to change their training policy by focusing on the recently employed doctors and nurse staff, as well as on graduates of medical schools, and by emphasising on experiential methods through team-works and role-playing. In 1999, the Liaison Psychiatry of 'Metaxa' hospital initiated the training of new-employed doctors and nurse staff with two seminars per year, presenting an educational videotape and using role-playing exercises to address ethical and moral issues that arise during the care of patients suffering from cancer, as well as for other psycho-oncology issues. The trainees' observations during the evaluation of the seminar regarding the experiential methods express the significance of the emotional interactions. An evaluation of this programme by a greater number of new doctors would validate its benefits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,583

Evidence suggests that deliberate rumination predicts posttraumatic growth (PTG), and mediates the relationship between coping and PTG. This study examined the relationship between rumination and psychological adjustment following pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality (TFA). Method: A cross-sectional, online study was conducted with women who had undergone TFA. Women were recruited from a support organization; 161 women completed the Brief COPE, the Perinatal Grief Scale, the Event-Related Rumination Inventory, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Data were analyzed using regression and mediation analyses. Results: The results show that women engaged in high levels of intrusive and deliberate rumination post-TFA and that intrusive rumination predicted grief. Intrusive and deliberate rumination predicted PTG, although intrusive rumination was a negative predictor of growth. Deliberate rumination mediated the relationship between grief and PTG. It also mediated the path between positive reframing and PTG, and religious coping and PTG, although the mediation effect depended upon the inclusion of the grief variable in the models. Conclusions: The results confirm the applicability of the PTG model to TFA and support the relevance of rumination to the PTG experience. The results also have clinical implications. Given the positive relationship between deliberate rumination and PTG, promoting interventions that encourage reflective thinking and narrative construction would benefit women post-TFA, particularly those experiencing high levels of distress and/or at risk of complicated grief.

In the work described herein, the reversible kinetics of mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE Fabs at substrate-supported planar membranes composed of 25 mol % DNP-conjugated phosphatidylethanolamine and 75 mol % dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine have been examined by using TIR-FPR. Data were obtained as a function of the Fab solution concentration. Higher Fab concentrations reduce rebinding (and increase the fluorescence recovery rate) because different Fab molecules compete for the same surface-binding sites. Data were also obtained for solutions containing different volume fractions of glycerol. In these measurements, higher glycerol concentrations increase rebinding (and decrease the fluorescence recovery rate) because the solution viscosity is increased and the Fab diffusion coefficient in solution is decreased. The TIR-FPR data were quantitatively compared with theoretical predictions which follow from the general theory for rebinding at the membrane surface. The data were consistent with the theoretical predictions and, therefore, provide experimental verification of the previously developed theory.",0,586

The control of the position of the stationary point brings to the concept of domain of viability. Starting from this system, the equations bring to light the parameters that push glioma cells out of their domain of viability. Four fundamental factors are highlighted. The first two are cerebral blood flow and the rate of lactate transport through monocarboxylate transporters, which must be reduced in order to push glioma out of its domain of viability. Another factor is the intra arterial lactate, which must be increased. The last factor is pH, indeed a decrease of intra cellular pH could interfere with glioma growth.

The presence of two heads is a prerequisite for this processive motility, but other interacting domains, like the neck and K-loop, influence the processivity and are implicated in allowing some single-headed kinesins to move processively. Neurospora kinesin (NKin) is a phylogenetically distant, dimeric kinesin from Neurospora crassa with high gliding speed and an unusual neck domain. We quantified the processivity of NKin and compared it to human kinesin, HKin, using gliding and fluorescence-based processivity assays. Our data show that NKin is a processive motor. Single NKin molecules translocated microtubules in gliding assays on average 2.14 micro m (N = 46). When we tracked single, fluorescently labeled NKin motors, they moved on average 1.75 micro m (N = 182) before detaching from the microtubule, whereas HKin motors moved shorter distances (0.83 micro m, N = 229) under identical conditions.

The greatest amount of nuclei containing fragmented DNA was observed on day 8 post-detachment, suggesting this was the peak occurrence of programmed cell death. Further, the temporal organization of programmed cell death suggests that the granule-secreting acini undergo apoptosis first, and that during the first week of oviposition the type I acini do not exhibit programmed cell death.

Despite this, relatively little is known about factors that give rise to intrusions. Cognitive models of PTSD highlight the importance of pre-existing cognitive vulnerabilities, cognitive processing and anxiety during a traumatic event, as well as negative responses to trauma sequelae. However, few studies have examined multiple forms of peritraumatic processes, and rumination in response to trauma intrusions using analogue trauma tasks, and none have examined whether broader anxious ruminative processes contribute to intrusion development. In addition, little work has investigated the role of post-state anxiety in intrusions, and anxiety may be related to both peritraumatic processing and rumination. The current study employed a distressing film paradigm to examine key tenets of cognitive models of PTSD. Ninety-one female university students completed measures of anxiety, rumination in response to anxious symptoms, peritraumatic dissociation, data driven processing, lack of self referent processing, intrusions, and rumination in response to intrusions of the distressing film. Results revealed that peritraumatic dissociation, data driven processing, and self referent processing were associated with intrusion development, with lack of self referent processing being a strong predictor of intrusion development. Post-state anxiety and rumination in response to intrusions also predicted intrusion development. Discussion focuses on implications of cognitive processes and anxiety in theories of intrusion development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,592

For the five silyl radicals where experimental data are available, the BLYP functional gives the most accurate determination of AEAs; the average absolute error is 0.04(1) eV, whereas the corresponding errors for the O3LYP, MPW1K, PBE1PBE, B3LYP, OLYP, and BHLYP functionals are 0.05(8), 0.06(0), 0.06(3), 0.08(5), 0.11(5), and 0.15(3) eV, respectively.",0,594

This is evident within, for instance, physical rehabilitation, where relieving patients' pain is a major challenge. To gain new understanding, develop and change, registered nurses have a great part in engaging their staff.DESIGNA qualitative study using a participatory action research approach was used, and a hermeneutic analysis was conducted.METHODSA group of three registered nurses, two assistant nurses and a physiotherapist took part in focus group sessions. This group was followed with seven repeated sessions during a period of five months from January 2010 until June 2010. A hermeneutic analysis was used.RESULTSThe participants changed their attitudes towards the patient in pain, their own caring role and the team's role towards a more person-centred care.CONCLUSIONSParticipation and reflection were key aspects as means to transfer knowledge into action and establish change. The participants came to the sessions, shared actively their experiences and expressed pride in the work they accomplished. This can be seen as an expression of a need to share and a joy to be working together in a person-oriented development area. In addition, the approach seemed to contribute to increased job satisfaction.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEThe participants expressed that their work resulted in a changed approach to pain and pain assessment in their daily practice at the ward.

596,"Lawn, S., et al. (2016"," ""Examining the use of metaphors to understand the experience of community treatment orders for patients and mental health workers."" BMC Psychiatry 16.","Background: Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) are often complex because of the ethical tensions created by an intervention that aims at promoting the patient’s good through an inherently coercive process. There is limited research that examines the complexity of CTOs and how patients on CTOs and workers administering CTOs make sense of their experiences. Methods: The study involved in-depth interviews with 8 patients on CTOs and 10 community mental health workers in South Australia, to explore how they constructed their experiences of CTOs. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) was used to analyse the data, supported by NVIVO software. Results: Analysis of the interviews revealed that patients and workers experienced the CTO process as multi-dimensional, including some positive as well as more negative constructions. The positive metaphor of CTOs as a safety net is described, followed by a more detailed description of the metaphors of power and control as the dominant themes, with five sub-themes of the CTO as control, wake-up, punishment, surveillance, and tranquiliser. Discussion: Metaphors are a way that mental health patients and mental health workers articulate the nature of CTOs. The language used to construct these metaphors was quite different, with patients overwhelmingly experiencing and perceiving CTOs as coercive (that is, punishing, controlling and scrutinizing), whereas workers tended to perceive them as necessary, beneficial and supportive, despite their coerciveness. Conclusions: By acknowledging the role of metaphors in these patients’ lives, workers could enhance opportunities to engage these patients in more meaningful dialogue about their personal experiences as an alternative to practice predominantly focused on risk. Such a dialogue could enhance workers’ reflection on their work and promote recovery-based practice. More understanding of how to promote autonomy, capacity and supported decision-making, and how to address the impacts of coercion within care, is needed.

Biophysical journal 109(2","Axonal microtubule (MT) bundles crosslinked by microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau are responsible for vital biological functions such as maintaining mechanical integrity and shape of the axon as well as facilitating axonal transport. Breaking and twisting of MTs have been previously observed in damaged undulated axons. Such breaking and twisting of MTs is suggested to cause axonal swellings that lead to axonal degeneration, which is known as ""diffuse axonal injury"". In particular, overstretching and torsion of axons can potentially damage the axonal cytoskeleton. Following our previous studies on mechanical response of axonal MT bundles under uniaxial tension and compression, this work seeks to characterize the mechanical behavior of MT bundles under pure torsion as well as a combination of torsional and tensile loads using a coarse-grained computational model. In the case of pure torsion, a competition between MAP tau tensile and MT bending energies is observed. After three turns, a transition occurs in the mechanical behavior of the bundle that is characterized by its diameter shrinkage. Furthermore, crosslink spacing is shown to considerably influence the mechanical response, with larger MAP tau spacing resulting in a higher rate of turns. Therefore, MAP tau crosslinking of MT filaments protects the bundle from excessive deformation. Simultaneous application of torsion and tension on MT bundles is shown to accelerate bundle failure, compared to pure tension experiments. MAP tau proteins fail in clusters of 10-100 elements located at the discontinuities or the ends of MT filaments. This failure occurs in a stepwise fashion, implying gradual accumulation of elastic tensile energy in crosslinks followed by rupture. Failure of large groups of interconnecting MAP tau proteins leads to detachment of MT filaments from the bundle near discontinuities. This study highlights the importance of torsional loading in axonal damage after traumatic brain injury.",0,597

Advances in experimental medicine and biology 714: 151-172.","The causes of metastasis remain unknown, however it has been proposed for nearly a century that metastatic cells are generated by fusion of tumor cells with tumor-associated leukocytes such as macrophages. Indeed, regardless of cell or tissue origin, when cancer cells in the original in situ tumor transform to malignant, invasive cells, they generally become aneuploid and begin to express molecules and traits characteristic of activated macrophages. This includes two key features of malignancy: chemotactic motility and the use of aerobic glycolysis as a metabolic energy source (the Warburg effect). Here we review evidence that these phenomena can be well-explained by macrophage-cancer cell fusion, as evidenced by studies of experimental macrophage-melanoma hybrids generated in vitro and spontaneous host-tumor hybrids in animals and more recently humans. A key finding to emerge is that experimental and spontaneous cancer cell hybrids alike displayed a high degree of constitutive autophagy, a macrophage trait that is expressed under hypoxia and nutrient deprivation as part of the Warburg effect. Subsequent surveys of 21 different human cancers from nearly 2,000 cases recently revealed that the vast majority (~85%) exhibited autophagy and that this was associated with tumor proliferation and metastasis. While much work needs to be done, we posit that these findings with human cancers could be a reflection of widespread leukocyte-cancer cell fusion as an initiator of metastasis. Such fusions would generate hybrids that express the macrophage capabilities for motility and survival under adverse conditions of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, while at the same time maintaining the deregulated mitotic cycle of the cancer cell fusion partner.",0,598

The procedure applied is mainly based on the use of Fourier transform IR and UV-vis spectroscopies and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and consists of the following steps: (1) compositional analysis of the artworks, with particular attention to components which may have a negative effect on the overall ageing; (2) evaluation of the actual state of conservation; (3) investigation of the accelerated ageing of reference polymer samples; and (4) monitoring of the natural ageing of the artworks. On such a basis, the following could be concluded. Stage Evidence by Loris Cecchini is made of poly(ether urethane) elastomer which contains a high amount of phthalates. Their exudation gives a sticky appearance to the artwork and their removal during ageing is the main cause of the loss of flexibility. The latex used by Andrés Pinal for tailoring Traxe de Home is a natural polyisoprene, whose oxidative degradation accounts for the extensive deterioration and yellowing of the artwork. The plaster sculptures of 3D Bodyscans 1:9 by Karin Sander are coated with an aliphatic epoxy resin. Its oxidation with formation of amides is the cause of the surface yellowing. The adhesive used by Dario Villalba for Tierra, Ladrillo y Agua is a commercial poly(vinyl acetate).

He had unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid studies and magnetic resonance imaging that showed abnormal thoracic cord signal and periventricular brain white matter changes with a normal pituitary gland and stalk. Dilated fundus examination showed multifocal areas of intra- and subretinal hemorrhage with serous retinal detachment. The workup included serologies and 2 normal bone marrow biopsies but did not reveal the underlying etiology. Because of the continued high suspicion for a malignant process, we performed bedside transconjunctival biopsy of the lacrimal gland. This demonstrated large, atypical CD20-positive B cells confined to the vessel lumina, consistent with IVL, an unusual form of large B-cell lymphoma.CONCLUSIONSThis case represents the first time that IVL has been detected via lacrimal gland biopsy, which may be a useful way to investigate cryptogenic neurologic processes.

Axial forces, Fresnel coefficients, average internal attenuation factors and effective internal reflection coefficients were calculated. Thermal and mechanical indices were also computed to address the safety issues in the implementation of acoustic tweezers and were found to be negligible. The results show that the overall distribution of axial forces is barely affected by attenuation. Furthermore, it is found that attenuation actually works against the scattering force and may therefore reinforce the axial trapping force. For a particle size of 180 microm, the maximum trapping force increases from 29.8 x 10(-11) N to 30.3 x 10(-11) N by 1.7% when attenuation is included.

However, to learn about real photosynthetic processes the minimal unit to study is a single photosynthetic membrane complete with all elements of its machinery. In the present work, the fluorescence spectra of excitons in lone intracytoplasmic (IC) photosynthetic membrane vesicles of the wild type purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides that involve peripheral (LH2) and core (RC-LH1-PufX) antenna pigment-protein complexes were investigated at ambient temperature under continuous-wave laser excitation into the Q(x) absorption band of the bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChl) chromophores at 594 nm. In parallel, the spectra of mutant membrane vesicles occupied by just one type of complexes (either LH2 or RC-LH1-PufX) and the spectra of individual purified LH2 and RC-LH1-PufX complexes were measured. The fluorescence from full IC membranes shows a high sensitivity to excitation intensity, being varied over more than four orders of magnitude between 0.1 W/cm(2) and 2 kW/cm(2). At low to moderate excitation intensities, the spectra of IC membranes could be well reproduced by its component spectra, the ratio of the spectra related to peripheral and core complexes being the only adjustable parameter. The spectra of both intact chromatophores and individual membrane components recorded over 1-50 s experimental time frames are robust, strongly suggesting that large spectral fluctuations hardly play a role in the functional photosynthetic process. The significant, up to 14 times, variation of the LH2 and LH1 emission ratio observed in individual IC membranes could be related to variations in the stoichiometric ratio of the peripheral and core complexes. Evidence was found for the presence of LH2 parts that are detached from efficient energy transfer pathways. Upon strong and prolonged illumination, the membrane spectra reveal significant permanent modifications. These alterations, which mostly concern peripheral antenna complexes, were shown to be due to photo-oxidation of various numbers of BChl molecules in the B850 compartment of LH2.",0,605

Research conducted over the last 50/years supports the proposition that depression and risk for depression are characterized by the operation of negative biases, and often by a lack of positive biases, in self-referential processing, interpretation, attention, and memory, as well as the use of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies. There is also evidence to suggest that deficits in cognitive control over mood-congruent material underlie these cognitive processes. Specifically, research indicates that difficulty inhibiting and disengaging from negative material in working memory: (1) increases the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination), decreases the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., reappraisal), and potentially impedes flexible selection and implementation of emotion regulation strategies; (2) is associated with negative biases in attention; and (3) contributes to negative biases in long-term memory. Moreover, studies suggest that these cognitive processes exacerbate and sustain the negative mood that typifies depressive episodes. In this review, we present evidence in support of this conceptualization of depression and discuss implications of research findings for theory and practice.

The active volume of a high frequency ultrasound chamber can be determined by the sound pressure penetration and distribution provided by the transducers. This work evaluated the sound pressure levels and uniformity achieved in water by selected commercial scale high frequency plate transducers without and with reflector plates. Sound pressure produced by ultrasonic plate transducers vertically operating at frequencies of 400 kHz (120 W) and 2 MHz (128 W) was characterized with hydrophones in a 2 m long chamber and their effective operating distance across the chamber's vertical cross section was determined. The 2 MHz transducer produced the highest pressure amplitude near the transducer surface, with a sharp decline of approximately 40% of the sound pressure occurring in the range between 55 and 155 mm from the transducer. The placement of a reflector plate 500 mm from the surface of the transducer was shown to improve the sound pressure uniformity of 2 MHz ultrasound. Ultrasound at 400 kHz was found to penetrate the fluid up to 2 m without significant losses. Furthermore, 400 kHz ultrasound generated a more uniform sound pressure distribution regardless of the presence or absence of a reflector plate. The choice of the transducer distance to the opposite reactor wall therefore depends on the transducer plate frequency selected. Based on pressure measurements in water, large scale 400 kHz reactor designs can consider larger transducer distance to opposite wall and larger active cross-section, and therefore can reach higher volumes than when using 2 MHz transducer plates.",0,608

Disks of simulated tissue (PVP hydrogel) were subjected to cyclic micromotion ranging from 0 at the center to 1000 microm at the periphery at approximately 13 Hz, relative to biomaterial surfaces or tissue culture polystyrene controls populated with human osteoblasts in standard tissue culture plate wells. The effect of the interfacial micromotion on the number of cells remaining attached was quantitated by XTT assay. The activity level of the remaining cells was determined by an alkaline phosphatase assay, and cell stress was evaluated by nitrogen assay. Significantly more cells (ANOVA) became detached from similarly prepared surfaces of titanium, hydroxyapatite, and alumina compared to the polystyrene control, and detachment from alumina was greater than for the other two materials. The activity of the remaining attached cells was lower as compared to the static (no micromotion) control but not significantly different among the biomaterials.

Therefore, the necessary quantity of captured fringes is very large, especially for the fringe reflection technique (FRT), since a pair of phases should be unwrapped to get the slopes of two perpendicular directions. In this paper, we propose a fast TPU algorithm based on the orthogonal grid fringes by which only one image is needed to extract the two integer phases for each frequency instead of two groups of phase shift fringes, and then they can be added into the wrapped phases separately to complete the unwrapping. There are ridge errors in the direct unwrapped phases, but they are significantly suppressed by our pseudo-phase-shift strategy without any extra captured fringes. The proposed method is robust and effective where the fringe amount used for unwrapping is only 1/4 of the previous similar algorithm and 1/6-1/8 of the traditional TPU methods. The detailed comparison of measurement time is also given, which demonstrate that the FRT measurement can be accelerated in most cases by our method.

Exp Appl Acarol 76(3","Phoretic associations between mites and insects commonly occur in patchy and ephemeral habitats. As plants provide stable habitats for herbivores, herbivorous mites are rarely dependent on other animals for phoretic dispersal. However, a phoretic gall mite, Aceria pallida, which is found on plants, seasonally attaches to a herbivorous insect, Bactericera gobica, for overwintering survival. After detachment, the gall mite shares a habitat with its vector and is likely to compete with this vector for plant resources. However, excessive competition works against the sustainability of the seasonal phoretic association. How the gall mite, as an obligate phoretic mite, balances this relationship with its vector during the growing season to achieve phoresy is unknown. Here, the plant-mediated interspecific interaction between the gall mite and the psyllid after detachment was studied in the laboratory and field. The laboratory results showed that infestation by the gall mite had detrimental effects on the survival and development of psyllid nymphs. Meanwhile, the mite population and the gall size were also adversely affected. The results from the field showed that the mean densities of the mite galls and psyllids were lower in the mixed-species infestation treatment than in the single-species infestation treatment across the investigation period. However, the interspecific interaction between the gall mite and the psyllid decreased rather than accelerated leaf abscission caused by the psyllid, which promoted the persistence of the psyllid population and then indirectly contributed to phoretic association. Our results suggest that the plant-mediated competition between the phoretic gall mite and its vector after detachment facilitates the maintenance of the phoretic association.",0,614

The Journal of chemical physics 149(6","A series of 20 composite structures, consisting of superhalogen and noble gas (Ng) hydrides, was explored via high-level coupled-cluster single, double and perturbative triple excitations calculations in this work. The existence of these composites, as local minima on the potential energy surface, arises from the charge transfer from the Ng hydride part to the superhalogen moiety. Clearly, this transfer could lead to stabilizing the interaction of the ionic type between the two components. The driving force of the charge transfer should be the high vertical electron detachment energy (VDE) of the superhalogen part leading to its enough capability of extracting the electron from the Ng hydride moiety. However, except triggering the ionic attractive interaction, there is nomonotonic correlation between the VDE value and the thermodynamic stability of the whole composite. This counter-intuitive result actually originates from the fact that, irrespective of various superhalogens, only two of their F ligands interact with the Ng atoms directly. Thus, although leading to higher VDE values, the increase in the number of electronegative ligands of the superhalogen moiety does not affect the stabilizing interaction of the composites here directly. In other words, with the necessary charge transfer generated, further increase of the VDE does not ensure the improvement of the thermodynamic stabilities of the whole composite. Moreover, in the transition state of the exothermic dissociation channel, more F atoms will give rise to higher probability of additional attractions between the F and H atoms which should lower the energy barrier. That is to say, increasing VDE, i.e., having more F atoms in many cases, will probably reduce the kinetic stability. Knowing the inevitable existence of the exothermic channel, kinetic stability is crucial to the ultimate goal of experimental observation of these Ng hydrides. Thus, in some cases, only the superhalogen itself may not provide enough information for the correct prediction on the properties of the whole composites. The understanding of the superhalogen-based composites will provide valuable information on the functional properties as well as the application potential of superhalogen clusters. Thus, the corresponding researches should focus on not only the superhalogen itself but also other related aspects, especially the details of the interaction between different parts.",0,615

The single-nucleotide specificity of the two DNA reactions allows highly selective detection of all types of single nucleotide changes (including single-nucleotide insertion and deletion), achieving a high discrimination factor with a median of 491 which is comparable with recently reported methods. For the first time, the enzyme assisted nucleic acid assay was characterized by single molecule analysis on total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) suggesting that the two steps do not work independently and the rate of TSD can be tuned by Endo IV facilitated conformation selection. The effective discrimination of the point mutation of BRAF gene in cancer and normal cell line suggests that this method can be a prominent post-PCR genotyping assay.",0,616

Sensors (Basel, Switzerland","Available microwave notch-type damage detection sensors are typically based on monitoring frequency shift or magnitude changes. However, frequency shift testing needs sweep-frequency data that make scanning detection becomes difficult and time-consuming. This work presents a microwave near-field nondestructive testing sensor for detecting sub-millimeter notch-type damage detection in metallic surfaces. The sensor is loaded with an interdigital electrode element in an open-ended coaxial. It is simple to fabricate and inexpensive, as it is etched on the RC4003 patch by using printed circuit board technology. The detection is achieved by monitoring changes in reflection amplitude, which is caused by perturbing the electromagnetic field around the interdigital structure. The proposed sensor was tested on a metallic plate with different defects, and the experimental results indicated that the interdigital electrode probe can determine the orientation, localization and dimension of surface notch-type damage.",0,617

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) results of glass transition temperatures of epoxy resins after immersion in hot water correlated well with the PALS and IR results. In addition, four types of water molecules, termed nonbonded (S(0)), single bonded (S(1)), loosely double hydrogen bonded (S(2L)), and tightly double bonded (S(2T)), were detected. It was likewise found, as verified by rough estimation, that water molecules with double hydrogen bonds mostly accomplished diffusion.",0,618

Lack of targeting accuracy while inserting needles can significantly mitigate the effectiveness of these methods. Robot-assisted needle steering under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance is a viable option for reaching the target accurately. In this paper, we report the development of an MRI-compatible needle driver for in-bore prostate biopsy. The device easily mounts onto and works together with our previously developed MRI-compatible prostate interventional robot. It is the first robotic device using a standard biopsy gun, which is easily replaceable/detachable in case of multi-sampling biopsy applications. The mechanism enables rotation, translation, and triggering of the biopsy gun to steer the bevel needle through the tissue and to take samples accurately from the target loci. Using the rotational and translational capabilities, the same system can also assist brachytherapy needle placement. Preliminary experiments have shown that the design meets the requirements set by the clinical workflow.

ACS applied materials & interfaces 9(3","It is well accepted that the microwave absorption performance (MAP) of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be enhanced via coating magnetic nanoparticles on their surfaces. However, it is still unclear if the magnetic coating structure has a significant influence on the microwave absorption behavior. In this work, nano-Fe3O4 compact-coated CNTs (FCCs) and Fe3O4 loose-coated CNTs (FLCs) are prepared using a simple solvothermal method. The MAP of the Fe3O4-coated CNTs is shown to be adjustable via controlling the Fe3O4 nanocoating structure. The results reveal that the overall MAP of coated CNTs strongly depends on the magnetic coating structure. In addition, the FCCs show a much better MAP than the FLCs. It is shown that the microwave absorption difference between the FLCs and FCCs is due to the disparate complementarities between the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss, which are related to the coverage density of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surfaces of CNTs. For FCCs, the mass ratio of CNTs to Fe3+ is then optimized to maximize the effective complementarities between the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss. Finally, a comparison is made with the literature on Fe3O4-carbon-based composites. The FCCs at the optimized CNT to Fe3+ ratio in the present work show the most effective specific RLmin (28.7 dB·mm-1) and the widest effective bandwidth (RL < -10 dB) (8.3 GHz). The excellent MAP of the as-prepared FCC sample is demonstrated to result from the consequent dielectric relaxation process and the improved magnetic loss. Consequently, the structure-property relationship revealed is significant for the design and preparation of CNT-based materials with effective microwave absorption.",0,620

We used density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)) with correlation consistent basis sets to study the structures and energetics of the electronic states of these anions. The adiabatic and vertical electron detachment energies (ADEs and VDEs) of the anionic clusters were calculated with 27 exchange-correlation functionals including one local spin density approximation functional, 13 generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals, and 13 hybrid GGA functionals, as well as the CCSD(T) method. For M(3)O(9)(-), CCSD(T) and nearly all of the DFT exchange-correlation functionals studied predict the (2)A(1) state arising from the Jahn-Teller distortion due to singly occupying the degenerate e' orbital to be lower in energy than the (2)A(1)' state arising from singly occupying the nondegenerate a(1)' orbital. For W(3)O(9)(-), the (2)A(1) state was predicted to have essentially the same energy as the (2)A(1)' state at the CCSD(T) level with core-valence correlation corrections included and to be higher in energy or essentially isoenergetic with most DFT methods.

Applied optics 55(29","Extinction coefficients are fundamental for analyzing radiative transport in micro/nano particle suspensions. In the traditional transmission method for measuring the extinction coefficient of particles in a cuvette, a reference system is used to compensate for the influence of the cuvette and base fluid. However, the multiple reflections and refractions between the air-glass and liquid-glass interfaces cannot be sufficiently eliminated by using the reference system, and the induced measurement error increases significantly with increasing difference in refractive index between the two neighboring media at these interfaces. In this paper, an improved transmission method is proposed to measure the extinction coefficient of micro/nano particles. The extinction coefficient of the particles is determined based on an optical model, taking into account the multiple reflection and refraction at the glass-liquid interfaces. An experimental validation was conducted for suspensions with various mean particle sizes. By considering the higher-order transmission terms, the improved transmission method generally achieved high-accuracy improvement over the traditional transmission method for extinction coefficient measurement, especially for the case with a small optical thickness of particle suspensions.

Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The PU-loop method for determining wave speed is based on the water hammer equation for flow in flexible tubes and artery using the method of characteristics. This technique determines wave speed using simultaneous measurements of pressure and velocity at a single point. The method shows that during the early part of systole, the relationship between pressure and velocity is generally linear, and the initial slope of the PU-loop is proportional to wave speed. In this work, we designed an in-vitro experiment to investigate the effect of proximity to a reflection site on the wave speed determined by the PU-loop through varying the distance between the measurement and reflection sites. Measurements were made in a flexible tube with a reflection site at the distal end formed by joining the tube to another tube with a different diameter and material properties. Six different flexible tubes were used to generate both positive and negative reflection coefficients of different magnitudes. We found that the wave speed determined by the PU-loop did not change when the measurement site was far from the reflection site but did change as the distance to the reflection site decreased. The calculated wave speed increased with positive reflections and decreased with negative reflections. The magnitude of the change in wave speed at a fixed distance from the reflection site increased with increasing the value of the reflection coefficient.",0,623

Journal of biomechanics 44(7","The relationship between the vessel diameter (D) and fluid velocity (U) in arteries and flexible tubes has been recently characterized as linear in the absence of wave reflections. This relationship allowed for determining local wave speed (C(DU)) using the lnDU-loop method. Using C(DU), it was possible to separate U and D waveforms into their forward and backward components. It was also possible to calculate wave intensity (dI(DU)), using D and U, from which the arrival time of reflected wave (Trw(DU)) could be determined. These techniques are fluid density independent and require only non-invasive measurements of D and U. In this work we experimentally validate the relative accuracy of these new techniques in vitro, by comparing their results of C(DU) and Trw(DU) to those determined by the established techniques, PU-loop and wave intensity analysis, C and Trw, respectively. We generated a single semi-sinusoidal wave in long flexible tubes, and simultaneously measured pressure (P), D, and U at the same site. Sequentially in time, we repeated this experiment at three sites along each of the flexible tubes, which were made of different materials and sizes, and three fluids of different densities. C(DU) compared well with that C and likewise Trw(DU) was very similar to Trw. Varying fluid density did not appreciably change the difference between the results of the two techniques. We conclude that the new techniques for determining C(DU) and Trw(DU), although independent of density, provide relatively accurate estimates of wave speed and arrival times of reflected waves in vitro. The new techniques require only non-invasive measurements of D and U, and further in vivo validation is required to establish its advantage in the clinical setting.",0,624

Journal of biomechanics 49(13","It has been shown that reflected waves affect the shape and magnitude of the arterial pressure waveform, and that reflected waves have physiological and clinical prognostic values. In general the reflection coefficient is defined as the ratio of the energy of the reflected to the incident wave. Since pressure has the units of energy per unit volume, arterial reflection coefficient are traditionally defined as the ratio of reflected to the incident pressure. We demonstrate that this approach maybe prone to inaccuracies when applied locally. One of the main objectives of this work is to examine the possibility of using wave intensity, which has units of energy flux per unit area, to determine the reflection coefficient. We used an in vitro experimental setting with a single inlet tube joined to a second tube with different properties to form a single reflection site. The second tube was long enough to ensure that reflections from its outlet did not obscure the interactions of the initial wave. We generated an approximately half sinusoidal wave at the inlet of the tube and took measurements of pressure and flow along the tube. We calculated the reflection coefficient using wave intensity (RdI and RdI0.5) and wave energy (RI and RI0.5) as well as the measured pressure (RdP) and compared these results with the reflection coefficient calculated theoretically based on the mechanical properties of the tubes. The experimental results show that the reflection coefficients determined by all the techniques we studied increased or decreased with distance from the reflection site, depending on the type of reflection. In our experiments, RdP, RdI0.5 and RI0.5 are the most reliable parameters to measure the mean reflection coefficient, whilst RdI and RI provide the best measure of the local reflection coefficient, closest to the reflection site. Additional work with bifurcations, tapered tubes and in vivo experiments are needed to further understand, validate the method and assess its potential clinical use.",0,625

The stability, transport and deposition of engineered CeO2 nanoparticles through water-saturated column packed with sand were studied by monitoring effluent CeO2 concentration. The influence of solution chemistry such as ionic strength (1-10 mM) and pH (3-9) on the mobility and deposition of CeO2 nanoparticles was investigated by using a three-phase (deposition-rinse-reentrainment) procedure in packed bed columns. The results show that water chemistry governs the transport and deposition of CeO2 nanoparticles. Transport is significantly hindered at acidic conditions (pH 3) and high ionic strengths (10 mM and above), and the deposited CeO2 particles may not be re-entrained by increasing the pH or lowering the ionic strength of water. At neutral and alkaline conditions (pH6 and 9), and lower ionic strengths (below 10 mM), partial breakthrough of CeO2 nanoparticles was observed and particles can be partially detached and re-entrained from porous media by changing the solution chemistry. A mathematical model was developed based on advection-dispersion-adsorption equations and it successfully predicts the transport, deposition and re-entrainment of CeO2 nanoparticles through a packed bed. There is strong agreement between the deposition rate coefficients calculated from experimental data and predicted by the model. The successful prediction for attachment and detachment of nanoparticles during the deposition and re-entrainment phases is unique addition in this study.

It is revealed that optical properties of these nanoarrays are predominantly dictated by their geometrical factors including the structural pitch, material filling ratio, and aspect ratio. Surprisingly, along with the proper geometrical design, the inverted nanopencil arrays can couple incident photons into optical modes in the pencil base efficiently in order to achieve excellent broadband and omnidirectional light-harvesting performances even with the substrate thickness down to 10 μm, which are comparable to the costly and technically difficult to achieve nanocone counterparts.

However, experimental evidence for the proposed causal pathway is scarce and the translating mechanisms are insufficiently understood. The study assessed the impact of social exclusion on paranoid beliefs in a quasi-experimental design and investigated the role of emotion regulation (ER) as a vulnerability indicator and emotional responses as a putative translating mechanism. Methods: Participants fulfilling criteria for clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR, n = 25), controls with anxiety disorders (AC, n = 40), and healthy controls (HC, n = 40) were assessed for dysfunctional (eg, rumination, catastrophizing, blaming) and functional ER-strategies (eg, reappraising, accepting, refocusing). They were then exposed to social exclusion during a virtual ball game (Cyberball) and assessed for changes in self-reported emotions and paranoid beliefs. Results: The CHR sample showed a significantly stronger increase in paranoid beliefs from before to after the social exclusion than both control groups. This was accounted for by lower levels of functional and higher levels of dysfunctional ER (compared to HC) and by a stronger increase in self-reported negative emotion in the CHR group (compared to AC and HC). Conclusions: The results confirm the role of negative emotion on the pathway from social stressors to psychotic symptoms and indicate that both the use of dysfunctional ER strategies and difficulties in employing functional strategies add to explaining why people at risk of psychosis respond to a social stressor with increased paranoia.",0,633

The association between the background variables and the sum score of the items of the questionnaire was tested with Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The open-ended question was analysed with content analysis.RESULTSSome psychiatric nurses perceived coercive measures as ethically problematic.

The detection of apoptosis was performed by confocal microscopy and annexin V and propidium iodide labelling; cell volume changes were monitored by video imaging. Within a few hours after isolation, enterocytes underwent anoikis (apoptosis induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix). They showed an early normotonic volume decrease (AVD) preceding the appearance of annexin V positivity. AVD occurred in correspondence with an increase in the [Ca(2+)](i), measured with Fura-2. When the cells were resuspended in high K(+) solution or treated with iberiotoxin, AVD was completely abolished. In addition, treatment with high K(+) or iberiotoxin significantly inhibited apoptosis progression.

Herein, we report, for the first time, the design, formation and testing of Fenton reaction for in vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). To realize in vivo fluorescence imaging of H2O2 via Fenton reaction, a functional nanosphere, Fc@MSN-FDNA/PTAD, is fabricated from mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN), a Fenton reagent of ferrocene (Fc), ROX-labeled DNA (FDNA), and a cationic perylene derivative (PTAD). The ferrocene molecules are locked in the pore entrances of MSN, and exterior of MSN is covalently immobilized with FDNA. As a key part, PTAD acts as not only the gatekeeper of MSN but also the efficient quencher of ROX. H2O2 can permeate into the nanosphere and react with ferrocene to product hydroxyl radical (·OH) via Fenton reaction, which cleaves FDNA to detach ROX from PTAD, thus in turn, lights the ROX fluorescence. Under physiological condition, H2O2 can be determined from 5.0 nM to 1.0 μM with a detection limit of 2.4 nM. Because of the rapid kinetics of Fenton reaction and high specificity for H2O2, the proposed method meets the requirement for real applications. The feasibility of Fc@MSN-FDNA/PTAD for in vivo applications is demonstrated for fluorescence imaging of exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in cells and mice.

Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) of heavily doped Si(100) creates mesoporous silicon nanowires (mp-SiNWs). mp-SiNWs are transferred from the MACE-treated wafer to a sticky tape, leaving residues composed of broken mp-SiNWs and a mesoporous Si layer on the wafer. Then the taped wafer is re-treated by MACE, without changing the etching conditions. The second MACE treatment generates mp-SiNWs that are less porous and longer than those generated by the first MACE treatment, which can be attributed to the difference in the surface topography at the beginning of the etching process. Less porous mp-SiNWs reduce optical scattering from the porous Si skeletons, and vertically protrude on the wafer without aggregation to facilitate optical trapping. Consequently, less porous mp-SiNWs effectively reduce ultraviolet-visible reflection loss.",0,638

ACS applied materials & interfaces.","One of the major hurdles of ferrites-based microwave absorbing materials is the limited working frequency that urgently calls for effective modification technique. Herein, a controllable carbothermal route has been developed to ameliorate the microwave absorption performance of Fe3O4 nanospheres by using MOFs shell as carbon source with changing ramping rates. Enhanced synergistic attenuation induced by varied composition and tailored morphology is of great importance, which can be regarded as the superiority of comprehensive (magnetic and dielectric) than unilateral (dielectric) modification technique. The drawback of dielectric modification can be concluded as separated attenuation mechanisms at discrete frequency, proven by the construction of core-shell structured Fe3O4@Prussian blue composite. The advantages of magnetic modification can also be confirmed by a series of Fe-based composites with unique composition and tailored structure derived from Fe3O4@Prussian blue composite at distinct heating rate. And the superiority can be summarized as rearrangement of magnetic loss by exceeding the Sonek limit and reinforcement of dielectric loss by enhancing electrical conductivity and introducing multiple polarization processes. Consequently, sample obtained at 10 oC∙min-1, which contains Fe and Fe3O4 shows an extended working frequency of 14.05 GHz with thickness less than 5 mm and a high reflection loss value of -48.04 dB at 1.55 mm.

However, the conventional route is confined to slight modification of the physicochemical properties of metal species and carbon, which also restricts the functionalization of MOF-derived materials. Here, a facile technique has been improved by making full use of highly porous structure to uniformly introduce metallic Co nanoparticles into carbon matrix derived from Cu3(btc)2. Through changing the starting amount of Co sources, the composition of the final products can be tuned, offering an effective route to control electromagnetic properties. Multiple attenuation mechanisms are employed to realize excellent reflection loss performance, which can be clarified by modified equivalent circuit mode. Effective frequency bandwidth ( fe) over the whole X band can be obtained by optimizing interfacial polarization through changing interface area and electrical conductivity. Broad fe covering almost the whole Ku band from 12.3 to 18 GHz with a thin thickness of 1.85 mm can be gained through improving impedance matching and enhancing conduction loss.

This work describes the design of a fluorescence light-up nanomicelle that can afford precise imaging-guided drug delivery and pharmacokinetic monitoring in a real-time fashion for cancer chemotherapy. The nanomicelle, which contains a boron dipyrromethene based fluorescent probe as the hydrophobic core and a redox-triggered detachable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell, can accumulate at the tumor site via enhanced permeation and retention effect. The PEG detachment induced by tumoral and intracellular glutathione can destabilize the nanomicelle, leading to fluorescence light up and simultaneous drug release. Importantly, the fluorescence intensities generated by the nanomicelles in different organs are well-correlated with released drug concentrations in both temporal and spatial manners, suggesting its precise role for imaging-guided drug delivery and pharmacokinetic monitoring in vivo. The tumor growth can be effectively inhibited by the docetaxel-loaded nanomicelle formulation, and the nanomicelles are monitored to be excreted via hepatobiliary routes.

Herein, we report on a straightforward strategy using a thin Au layer to enhance the SHG from a single CdS nanobelt by 3 orders of magnitude. Through detailed experimental and theoretical analysis, we validate that the augmented SHG originates from the mutual intensification of the local fields induced by the plasmonic nanocavity and by the reflections within the CdS Fabry-Pérot resonant cavity in this hybrid semiconductor-metal system. Polarization-dependent SHG measurements can be employed to determine and distinguish the contributions of SH signals from the CdS nanobelt and gold film, respectively.

Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 nurses at one paediatric clinic. The data were analysed by means of content analysis. Results: The interviews suggested that when a child’s pain followed an expected pattern and they complied with treatment, the nurses trusted their knowledge and felt comfortable. On the other hand, in unpredictable situations the nurses felt fearful, powerless, abandoned and distrustful. Conclusion: The nurses were comfortable in predictable situations, but if a situation was unpredictable, they felt they had lost control over it. Implications for pain management: To reduce feelings of abandonment,work shifts should be organized so that more experienced nurses can work side by side with those who are less experienced.

Environ Sci Process Impacts 20(8","The degradation in water of the most widespread herbicide, glyphosate, is still under debate. Experimental disagreements on this process exist and there are only a few theoretical studies to support any conclusions. Moreover, the relationship between glyphosate and glycine is underestimated. Besides the structural similarity, glycine is a product of glyphosate degradation; hence, their studies are complementary. In this study, two mechanisms for the decomposition of the glyphosate molecule and glycine molecule in water are proposed. These mechanisms were explored by using quantum mechanical calculations. A combined microsolvation/PCM approach was employed to find and characterize their transition states, by which the reaction pathways were determined via the IRC method. The results have shown that the degradation processes might occur via a C-C bond cleavage, through a concerted mechanism, whereby the proton transfers and the CO2 detachments occur simultaneously. The second mechanism had two consecutive steps, a decarboxylation followed by the proton transfers. The water molecules served as a conduit for the proton transfers, away from the amine group (or the phosphonate, glyphosate case). Their function was to assist the reactions in a water-mediated decarboxylation. In these particular cases, the free energy of activation was 42.68 and 42.28 kcal mol-1 for the glycine structure and the glyphosate structure, respectively. These results agreed with the photodegradation and thermodegradation of glyphosate, as well as with the spontaneous decarboxylation of glycine.

Disasters have strong political background and consequences. They shake the life of a community and raise questions about safety, social organization and the meaning of life. Disasters confront psychiatrists with challenges far beyond regular clinical activities or research strategies. During early interventions after a disaster, psychiatrists often have to work out of their usual clinical premises, in contact with unfamiliar professionals (i.e. rescue personnel) and with individuals who should not be considered as 'cases', and therefore without keeping regular clinical records. In the latter stages they have to confront many factors which tend to cause the clinical consequences of those affected and who developed a psychiatric condition to be chronic. Reactions to stress occur in stages, each one characterised by a specific psychological mechanism. Symptoms include flashbacks, difficulties in remembering, avoidance of stimuli, blunting of responses, high arousal level and obsessive ruminations. The strong biological and psychosocial factors which are unchained after a disaster should be recognised and chanelled.

In this work, we determine the mechanism responsible for the higher activity against Escherichia coli of the C-terminal lysine dimer of magainin 2, (MG2)2K, in comparison to the monomeric peptide magainin 2 (MG2). Langmuir monolayers and vesicles made with the E. coli lipid extract were used to address the two possible states for the peptide-membrane interaction, namely the ""binding state"" and ""pore state"", respectively. The incorporation of MG2 and (MG2)2K in lipid monolayers at the air-water interface caused slight differences in surface pressure isotherms and polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption (PM-IRRAS) spectra, and therefore the difference in activity is not associated with the binding state. In contrast, large differences were observed in the leakage experiments where (MG2)2K was shown to disrupt the large unilamellar vesicles to a much higher extent owing to efficient pore formation. The binding and penetration of MG2 and (MG2)2K were also probed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for bilayers made with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPE:POPG).

It is predominantly about British royal culture and family, but it also provides an example of how symptoms can preserve homeostasis within a family system, and how class, socioeconomic status, and roles can be constraining. There are myriad therapeutic implications and applications that arise from The King’s Speech. A main therapeutic point is the understanding that symptoms often serve an important function within a family system; the preservation of homeostasis is a powerful force. It can be a great asset to a clinician to investigate family of origin issues in order to understand the current presenting problem.

This work examines the dynamics of structurally-defined motor complexes containing two myosin Va (myoVa) motors that are linked together via a molecular scaffold formed from a single duplex of DNA. Dynamic changes in the filament-bound configuration of these complexes due to motor binding, stepping, and detachment were monitored by tracking the positions of different color quantum dots that report the position of one head of each myoVa motor on actin. As in studies of multiple kinesins, the run lengths produced by two myosins are only slightly larger than those of single motor molecules. This suggests that internal strain within the complexes, due to asynchronous motor stepping and the resultant stretching of motor linkages, yields net negative cooperative behaviors. In contrast to multiple kinesins, multiple myosin complexes move with appreciably lower velocities than a single-myosin molecule. Although similar trends are predicted by a discrete state stochastic model of collective motor dynamics, these analyses also suggest that multiple myosin velocities and run lengths depend on both the compliance and the effective size of their cargo. Moreover, it is proposed that this unique collective behavior occurs because the large step size and relatively small stalling force of myoVa leads to a high sensitivity of motor stepping rates to strain.",0,660

The droplet was subjected to a uniform electric field with strengths ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 V/nm. Both the experiments and simulations demonstrate a mixed charge emission regime where field-induced desorption of solvated ions and charged droplets occurs. The macroscopic parameters, such as average mass-to-charge ratio and maximum surface-normal field strengths deduced from the simulations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental work and consistent with electrohydrodynamic theory of cone-jets. The observed mass spectrometric Na (+) and I (-) solvated ion distributions are consistent with a thermal evaporation process, and are correctly reproduced by the simulation after incorporation of the different flight times and unimolecular ion dissociation rates in the analysis. Alignment of formamide dipoles and field-induced reorganization of the positive and negative ionic charges in the interfacial region are both found to contribute to the surface-normal field near the points of charge emission. In the simulations the majority of cluster ions are found to be emitted from the tip of the jet rather than from the neck region next to the Taylor cone. This finding is consistent with the experimental energy distributions of the solvated ions which demonstrate that indeed most ions are emitted closer to the jet region, that is, beyond the cone-neck region where ohmic losses occur. This observation is also consistent with continuum electrohydrodynamic predictions of cluster-ion evaporation at surface regions of high curvature and therefore maximum surface electric field strengths, which may be the cone-neck region, the breakup region of the jet (usually near the tip of the jet), or the emitted charged droplets. In the nanoscale jets observed in this study, the regions of highest spatial curvature are at the ends of the jets where nascent drops either are forming or have just detached.",0,662

A number of data collections are reported, which were carried out at the beamlines F1 and D3 of Hasylab (DESY, Hamburg) first at 100 K and later at 15-20 K, demonstrating the quality of the measured intensities.

X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained in the symmetric reflection geometry on a DRON-4 diffractometer (Mo K(alpha) radiation, LiF monochromator) in automatic mode. Molecular dynamics simulation of amorphous tungsten oxide atomic configurations has been carried out in the micro-canonical ensemble (NVE) for N = 208 atoms and N = 624 atoms, in a cubic cell, using pairwise Born-Mayer interaction potentials and periodic boundary conditions. One of the purposes of the present work is to analyze the influence of the parameters and the cutoff of the interaction potentials on the interatomic distances. The values obtained in the molecular dynamics simulation for the pair functions D(r) are compared with the experimental data for amorphous oxides in order to choose the most convenient aforesaid values. The values of the average interatomic distances and the coordination numbers obtained by both methods are also compared. The result shows that the tungsten subsystem can be well reproduced using the potential cutoff radius of about 4 A, but the oxygen subsystem can be well reproduced when the cutoff of the potential for the W-O pairs is equal to 2.8 A. The configuration built during the molecular dynamics experiment consists of distorted octahedra. These octahedra form chains, as in the WO(3) phases of type ReO(3), and hexagonal rings, of the same type as in the WO(3)(1/3)H(2)O phase, when we extract (1/3)O at every WO(3) unit.

Cells 7(2","Anchoring of heterochromatin to the nuclear envelope appears to be an important process ensuring the spatial organization of the chromatin structure and genome function in eukaryotic nuclei. Proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) mediating these interactions are able to recognize lamina-associated heterochromatin domains (termed LAD) and simultaneously bind either lamin A/C or lamin B1. One of these proteins is the lamin B receptor (LBR) that binds lamin B1 and tethers heterochromatin to the INM in embryonic and undifferentiated cells. It is replaced by lamin A/C with specific lamin A/C binding proteins at the beginning of cell differentiation and in differentiated cells. Our functional experiments in cancer cell lines show that heterochromatin in cancer cells is tethered to the INM by LBR, which is downregulated together with lamin B1 at the onset of cell transition to senescence. The downregulation of these proteins in senescent cells leads to the detachment of centromeric repetitive sequences from INM, their relocation to the nucleoplasm, and distension. In cells, the expression of LBR and LB1 is highly coordinated as evidenced by the reduction of both proteins in LBR shRNA lines. The loss of the constitutive heterochromatin structure containing LADs results in changes in chromatin architecture and genome function and can be the reason for the permanent loss of cell proliferation in senescence.",0,665

In this work we have filled this gap by experimentally and theoretically examining the growth and detachment dynamics of oxygen bubbles from hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyzed by gold. We measured the bubble radius R(t) as a function of time by confocal microscopy and find R(t) ∝ t1/2. This diffusive growth behavior demonstrates that the bubbles grow from an oxygen-oversaturated environment. For several consecutive bubbles detaching from the same position in a short period of time, a well-repeated growing behavior is obtained from which we conclude the absence of noticeable depletion effect of oxygen from previous bubbles or increasing oversaturation from the gas production. In contrast, for two bubbles far apart either in space or in time, substantial discrepancies in their growth rates are observed, which we attribute to the variation in the local gas oversaturation. The current results show that the dynamical evolution of bubbles is influenced by comprehensive effects combining chemical catalysis and physical mass transfer. Finally, we find that the size of the bubbles at the moment of detachment is determined by the balance between buoyancy and surface tension and by the detailed geometry at the bubble's contact line.",0,669

The mechanisms of injury, the nature of the IOFBs, the BCVA before and after the surgery, the penetrating site and the complications of the surgery were all collected. Univariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the prognostic factors. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years. The nature of IOFBs was mainly metal. Most injuries were commonly caused by hammering the metal. The mean preoperative VA was 2.30 logMAR, and mean final VA was 0.92 logMAR. From univariate analysis, good visual outcome was correlated with the good visual acuity before surgery and poor visual outcome was correlated with the macular break and multiple surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: In a tertiary hospital of eastern China, most cases of IOFBs were work-related. The prognosis of the patients was really well in the patients with good presenting visual acuity. Nevertheless the prognosis was not good for those patients who had macular injury or underwent several surgeries because of retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane or proliferative vitreous retinopathy.

Studies have suggested that clinical librarians may promote evidence-based practice. To date, little is known about clinical librarians participating nurses in the wards.DESIGNA descriptive, qualitative design was adopted for the study.METHODIn 2007, 16 nurses who had been attended by a clinical librarian in the wards were interviewed in focus groups. Two clinical librarians were interviewed by individual interviews. In the analysis, a content analysis was used.RESULTSThree themes were generated from the interviews with nurses: 'The grip of everyday work', 'To articulate clinical nursing issues' and 'The clinical librarians at a catalyst'. The nurses experienced the grip of everyday work as a hindrance and had difficulties to articulate and formulate relevant nursing issues. In such a state, the nurses found the clinical librarian presence in the ward as enhancing the awareness of and the use of evidence-based practice. Three themes emerged from the analysis with the librarians.

Current biology : CB 15(23","BACKGROUNDCytoplasmic dynein is the molecular motor responsible for most retrograde microtubule-based vesicular transport. In vitro single-molecule experiments suggest that dynein function is not as robust as that of kinesin-1 or myosin-V because dynein moves only a limited distance (approximately 800 nm) before detaching and can exert a modest (approximately 1 pN) force. However, dynein-driven cargos in vivo move robustly over many microns and exert forces of multiple pN. To determine how to go from limited single-molecule function to robust in vivo transport, we began to build complexity in a controlled manner by using in vitro experiments.RESULTSWe show that a single cytoplasmic dynein motor frequently transitions into an off-pathway unproductive state that impairs net transport. Addition of a second (and/or third) dynein motor, so that cargos are moved by two (or three) motors rather than one, is sufficient to recover several properties of in vivo motion; such properties include long cargo travels, robust motion, and increased forces. Part of this improvement appears to arise from selective suppression of the unproductive state of dynein rather than from a fundamental change in dynein's mechanochemical cycle.CONCLUSIONSMultiple dyneins working together suppress shortcomings of a single motor and generate robust motion under in vitro conditions. There appears to be no need for additional cofactors (e.g., dynactin) for this improvement. Because cargos are often driven by multiple dyneins in vivo, our results show that changing the number of dynein motors could allow modulation of dynein function from the mediocre single-dynein limit to robust in vivo-like dynein-driven motion.",0,677

Current interventions include focal laser or intravitreal injections. This article outlines a new treatment protocol based on the theory that peripheral ischemia is the precursor to angiogenesis, which will ultimately gather its momentum at the fovea. Extreme peripheral light laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) back to the equator reduces excessive production of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the eye. This decreases VEGF-induced DME and provides long-term protection against the development of neovascularization. Initial exacerbation of DME often accompanies PRP. Therefore, injections of anti-VEGF agents (with or without dexamethasone implants) initially can forestall worsening of DME and prevent loss of vision. However, on the other hand, applying peripheral PRP and intraocular injections can induce posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). This could help release vitreomacular adhesions (VMA) and vitreomacular traction (VMT), thereby decreasing DME severity and improving the response to intravitreal injections. In the current approach, peripheral retinal photocoagulation should stop the drive for VEGF release; moreover, laser ablation should produce secondary, accidental, and beneficial PVD. This approach precludes focal laser therapy and paves the path for prolonged intervals between anti-VEGF therapy.",0,679

Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was used as a control. CHA cement could be directly injected and solidified in situ to repair bone defects. Histology results showed that CHA bonded with bone through gradual remodeling and was replaced by new bone tissue, which is an attribute for excellent biocompatibility. The interfacial bonding strength increased with implantation time. After 16 weeks implantation, the measured detaching force and the pullout force between CHA and bone were 281 +/- 16 N and 512.5 +/- 14.5 N, respectively. These values were several times higher compared to 5 days implantation. In contrast, the control showed a fibrous microstructure between PMMA and bone, and the detaching force and the pullout force decreased with implantation time.

In this study, in order to extract and solubilise these proteins, the eggshell membranes were treated in an alkali solution. A Box-Behnken design was employed to determine the influence of the treatment variables on the amount of protein solubilised. Furthermore, the effect of ultrasound on the protein recovery yield was also evaluated and compared with the unmodified process. RESULTS: A solubilised protein yield close to 100% of the total eggshell membrane protein was obtained. The optimal conditions could be set at 70 degrees C in a 1.0 mol L(-1) NaOH solution for 60 min. However, when ultrasound was applied, it was possible to decrease the time of reaction by half. In the two processes, the temperature was found to be the most important independent variable evaluated. Finally, the antioxidant properties of the proteins obtained in each case were similar.

Sensors (Basel, Switzerland","Signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) were originally conceived for position and speed determination, but they can be used as signals of opportunity as well. The reflection process over a given surface modifies the properties of the scattered signal, and therefore, by processing the reflected signal, relevant geophysical data regarding the surface under study (land, sea, ice…) can be retrieved. In essence, a GNSS-R receiver is a multi-channel GNSS receiver that computes the received power from a given satellite at a number of different delay and Doppler bins of the incoming signal. The first approaches to build such a receiver consisted of sampling and storing the scattered signal for later post-processing. However, a real-time approach to the problem is desirable to obtain immediately useful geophysical variables and reduce the amount of data. The use of FPGA technology makes this possible, while at the same time the system can be easily reconfigured. The signal tracking and processing constraints made necessary to fully design several new blocks. The uniqueness of the implemented system described in this work is the capability to compute in real-time Delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) either for four simultaneous satellites or just one, but with a larger number of bins. The first tests have been conducted from a cliff over the sea and demonstrate the successful performance of the instrument to compute DDMs in real-time from the measured reflected GNSS/R signals. The processing of these measurements shall yield quantitative relationships between the sea state (mainly driven by the surface wind and the swell) and the overall DDM shape.

In this work, we first demonstrate the limited accuracy that can be achieved by thresholding techniques and propose a hybrid method which is based on closed contours and thresholding. The method has been evaluated on 269 specular reflections in 49 images which were taken from 27 real laparoscopic interventions. Our method improves the average sensitivity by 16% compared to the state-of-the-art thresholding methods.",0,685

(2010"," ""Analytical possibilities of total reflection X-ray spectrometry (TXRF","Selenium content of soils is an important issue due to the narrow range between the nutritious requirement and toxic effects upon Se exposure. However, its determination is challenging due to low concentrations within complex matrices that hamper the analysis in most spectroscopic techniques. In this study, we explored the possibilities of several analytical approaches combined with total reflection X-ray (TXRF) spectrometry for soil Se determinations. The direct analysis of a solid suspension using 20 mg of fine ground material (<50 μm) has a relatively high Se limit of detection (LOD) of 1 mg/kg (worldwide Se average in soils = 0.4 mg/kg) and is therefore only suitable for seleniferous soils. Several fast and simple analytical strategies were developed to decrease matrix effects and improve the LOD for Se determination in soil digests. On one hand, the application of a liquid-liquid extraction procedure using ethyl ether and the introduction of a Cr absorbent in the instrument configuration were carried out to avoid the associated problems on TXRF analysis of soil extracts due to the high Fe concentrations (∼700 mg/L). On the other hand, a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure (DLLME) before the TXRF analysis of the soil digest was also developed. The effects of various experimental parameters such as sample volume, effect of major elements present in the soil matrix (Fe), and Se concentration in the sample were investigated. The LOD using this analytical methodology (0.05 mg/kg of Se) was comparable to or lower than those obtained in previous works using other popular spectrometric techniques such as GFAAS, ICPMS, and AFS. The calculated Se concentration for JSAC-0411 ([Se] = 1.32 ± 0.27 mg/kg) using the combination of DLLME and TXRF ([Se] = 1.40 ± 0.23 mg/kg) was in agreement with the certified value.",0,686

After exclusion of eyes with previous treatment, follow-up less than 12 months, or missed visits, 99 patients were included in the analysis. The influence of baseline characteristics, initial VA response, and central retinal thickness (CRT) fluctuations on the VA stability from month 3 to month 24 were analyzed using subgroups and multiple regression analyses.RESULTSMean follow-up duration was 21.3 months (range 12-40 months, 32 patients followed-up for ≥24 months). Secondary loss of VA (loss of five letters or more) after month 3 was seen in 30 patients (mean VA improvement from baseline +5.8 letters at month 3, mean loss from baseline -5.3 letters at month 12 and -9.7 at final visit up to month 24), while 69 patients maintained vision (mean gain +8.9 letters at month 3, +10.4 letters at month 12, and +12.8 letters at final visit up to month 24). Secondary loss of VA was associated with the presence of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) at baseline (p 0.01), but not with baseline fibrosis/atrophy/hemorrhage, CRT fluctuations, or initial VA response. Chart analysis revealed additional individual explanations for the secondary loss of VA, including retinal pigment epithelial tears, progressive fibrosis, and atrophy.CONCLUSIONSTissue damage due to degeneration of PED, retinal pigment epithelial tears, progressive fibrosis, progressive atrophy, or massive hemorrhage, appears to be relevant in causing secondary loss of VA despite vascular endothelial growth factor suppression.

The X-ray structural investigation (MoK(α)) at 98 K on these crystals revealed a CNCbl-TFA salt of formula [CNCbl(H)](TFAc)·14H(2)O (1, where TFA = trifluoracetic acid; TFAc(-) = trifluoracetate anion), in which a proton transfer from the trifluoracetic acid to the phosphate-O4P oxygen atoms is observed. 1 crystallizes in the standard orthorhombic P2(1)2(1)2(1) space group, a = 16.069(2) Å, b = 20.818(2) Å, c = 24.081(2) Å, Z = 4. The final full-matrix least-squares refinements on F(2) converged with R(1) = 4.1% for the 18957 significant reflections, a very low crystallographic residual for cobalamins, which facilitated the analysis of the extensive network of hydrogen bonds within the lattice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cobalamin structure to show protonation of the phosphate group of the cobalamin nucleotide loop. In this work, the crystal structure of 1 is analyzed and compared to other CNCbls reported in the literature, namely, CNCbl·3PrOH·12H(2)O (2, PrOH = propyl alcohol), CNCbl·acetone·20H(2)O (3), CNCbl·2LiCl·10.2H(2)O (4), and CNCbl·2KCl·10.6H(2)O (5). The analysis confirmed that protonation of the phosphate leaves the major CNCbl structural parameters unaffected, so that 1 can be considered an ""unmodified"" Cbl solvate. However, comparison between 1-5 led to interesting findings. In fact, although the cobalt(III) coordination sphere in 1-5 is similar, significant differences could be noted in the upward fold angle of the corrin macrocycle, a parameter commonly related to the steric hindrance of the axial lower ""α"" nucleotide-base and the electronic trans influence of the upper ""β"" substituent. This suggests that crystal-packing forces may influence the corrin deformation as well. Herein we explore, on the basis of the newly acquired structure and reported crystallographic data, whether the incongruities among 1-5 have to be attributed to random crystal packing effects or if it is possible to associate them with specific crystal packing (clusters).",0,689

By increasing adhesion of these networks at the delivery site of the upper small intestine by utilizing small covalent chemical linkages caused by the addition of an aldehyde functional group we can make them more viable. These aldehydes bind covalently by way of a condensation reaction with the amines of the amino acids found in the glycoprotein network of the mucus layer of the small intestine to form imines. To investigate the effectiveness of this linkage the co-polymers are prepared in three different percentages of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and aldehyde-modified PEG, and characterized through swelling, release and adhesion testing. The percentages of aldehyde-modified PEG used are 0.06, 0.6 and 3.3%. The swelling results indicate that the formulations with the aldehyde-modified PEG maintained the same pH sensitivity and transition around a pH of 5.8 as those formulations without the aldehyde moiety. Release results indicate that the release of insulin of the most promising 3.3% aldehyde formulation was successful with a release of about 80% after 3 h, which compares favorably with the similar release of the controls done in previous work. Adhesion testing was carried out through the use of a mechanical testing apparatus. Data have been gathered and plotted to give a detachment force (N) versus displacement (m) curve, of which the work of adhesion (μJ) was found by taking the area underneath the curve. Adhesion results indicate an increase to the already present adhesion of the co-polymers due to increased percentages of the aldehyde-modified PEG tethers where the 3.3% formulation showed an increase of 10-30 μJ over both control formulations.",0,690

In this study we tested whether differences in terms of neural activation are present between a group of PI patients and a healthy-control group while they are exposed to idiosyncratic ruminations and worries, evoked visually by words, so as to explore their hypothetical link with default-mode network (DMN) dysfunction in PI. We recruited five PI patients diagnosed according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 2 (ICSD-2) of American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and five age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were recruited at the outpatient Sleep Medicine Centre of the Coimbra University Hospital Centre. We used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) block-design paradigm where the participants visualized lists of words related to past/present and future concerns and also emotionally neutral words. The results suggested that the PI patients showed a failure of the DMN to deactivate. Moreover, when these patients were exposed to words concerning both past/present ruminations and future worries, there was a pronounced and significant over-recruitment of brain areas related to DMN and self-referential processing when they were compared to healthy volunteers. The differences between the patient and control groups were also evident in self-report measures. In sum, despite the relatively small sample size, our study clearly suggests that in PI there is a dysfunction in brain regions pertaining to self-referential processing, which is corroborated by an overall pattern of hyperarousal in brain regions comprising the DMN. These data may be useful in the improvement of pathophysiological models, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for insomnia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)",0,691

Indeed the fluorescence emission band of C60 experiences a progressive bathochromic shift with respect to C60 in solution as the cavity dimensions of the host decrease in going from the mesoporous material MCM41 to UTD-1 and Na-Y zeolites. This experimental observation, which has been documentarily confirmed by theoretical predictions and recent experimental results, is a reflection of the confinement effect imposed by the host. However, the most striking result reported in this work is that the fluorescence range accessible to this occluded species can be extraordinarily extended by confinement inside the neutral cages of a ""dendritic box"". The ability of the dendritic shell to create a microenvironment, modifying the properties of its functional core, allows the emission bands of C60 incorporated into a dendrimer to be effectively red-shifted with respect to their emission in solution, and, contrarily to other confined spaces of considerable hardness such as zeolites or the high surface material MCM41, the magnitude of this shifting is maximum and can be modulated under appropriate experimental conditions.

Fifteen apparently healthy male subjects (aged 30.6 ± 6.2 y) were given a 2.5 g oral dose of ST after baseline measurements were recorded. Pulse wave analysis using radial artery applanation tonometry was performed in triplicate at baseline (0 min) and at 10-min intervals during (10, 20 and 30 min) and after (40, 50 and 60 min) ST use. An acute dose of ST was associated with a significant increase in heart rate (HR), central aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, peripheral brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and aortic augmentation index normalized to a fixed heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@75). Furthermore, ejection duration and round trip travel time of the reflected pressure wave (Δt(p)) were significantly decreased as a result of one time ST use. As a result of changes in aortic pressure wave reflection characteristics, there was a significant increase in wasted left ventricular pressure energy (LVE(w)) and the tension-time index (TTI) as a result of ST use. In conclusion, one time use of ST elicits significant transient increases in HR, central aortic pressures, AIx@75, the TTI and LVE(w).

J Vis Exp(137","The ubiquitous presence of plastic debris in the ocean is widely recognized by the public, scientific communities, and government agencies. However, only recently have microplastics in freshwater systems, such as rivers and lakes, been quantified. Microplastic sampling at the surface usually consists of deploying drift nets behind either a stationary or moving boat, which limits the sampling to environments with low levels of suspended sediments and floating or submerged debris. Previous studies that employed drift nets to collect microplastic debris typically used nets with >/=300 microm mesh size, allowing plastic debris (particles and fibers) below this size to pass through the net and elude quantification. The protocol detailed here enables: 1) sample collection in environments with high suspended loads and floating or submerged debris and 2) the capture and quantification of microplastic particles and fibers <300 microm. Water samples were collected using a peristaltic pump in low-density polyethylene (PE) containers to be stored before filtering and analysis in the lab. Filtration was done with a custom-made microplastic filtration device containing detachable union joints that housed nylon mesh sieves and mixed cellulose ester membrane filters. Mesh sieves and membrane filters were examined with a stereomicroscope to quantify and separate microplastic particulates and fibers. These materials were then examined using a micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (micro ATR-FTIR) to determine microplastic polymer type. Recovery was measured by spiking samples using blue PE particulates and green nylon fibers; percent recovery was determined to be 100% for particulates and 92% for fibers. This protocol will guide similar studies on microplastics in high velocity rivers with high concentrations of sediment. With simple modifications to the peristaltic pump and filtration device, users can collect and analyze various sample volumes and particulate sizes.",0,696

Journal of chemical theory and computation 14(7","During host cell infection by flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika, acidic pH within the endosome triggers a conformational change in the envelope protein on the outer surface of the virion. This results in exposure of the ∼15 residue fusion peptide (FP) region, freeing it to induce fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes. A better understanding of the conformational dynamics of the FP in the presence of membranes, and the basis for its selectivity for anionic lipid species present within the endosome, would facilitate its therapeutic targeting with antiviral drugs and antibodies. In this work, multiscale modeling, simulations, and free energy calculations (including a total of ∼75 μs of atomic-resolution sampling), combined with imaging total internal reflection fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments, were employed to investigate the mechanisms of interaction of FP variants with lipid bilayers. Wild-type FPs (in the presence or absence of a fluorescein isothiocyanate tag) were shown to possess a funneled conformational landscape governing their exit from solvent and penetration into the lipid phase and to exhibit an electrostatically favored >2-fold affinity for membranes containing anionic species over purely zwitterionic ones. Conversely, the landscape was abolished in a nonfunctional point mutant, leading to a 2-fold drop in host membrane affinity. Collectively, our data reveal how the highly conserved flavivirus FP has evolved to funnel its conformational space toward a maximally fusogenic state anchored within the endosomal membrane. Therapeutically targeting the accessible ensemble of FP conformations may represent a new, rational strategy for blocking viral infection.",0,697

Water research 126: 240-251.","Effluents derived from a municipal wastewater treatment plant were used for virus filtration/retention experiments by using a horizontal laboratory filter. Filtration tests were performed to examine how soil geochemical heterogeneity and fracture patterns affected the transport of viruses in groundwater in order to model the influence of reductive perturbations in ionic strength (IS) during wastewater filtration. Although perturbations of IS and velocity are known to result in resuspension of colloids, we found that the effect of soil geochemical heterogeneity can produce strong and instantaneous virus releases in fractured aquifers, likely an internal additional source of viruses. Sixteen limestone slabs were packed in a PVC box filter at the Bari Laboratory (South Italy) to replicate wastewater filtration throughout a fractured medium similar to the Bari carbonate aquifer. Terra rossa, which is an aggregate of sand, silt and clay, was unevenly spread on the surface of each limestone slab within the filter. Since the mineralogical composition of terra rossa includes iron (hematite, magnetite, and goethite) oxides, the soil exhibited localized unfavorable colloid/collector interactions for attachment. In contrast, soil-free parts of the fracture surfaces maintained favorable colloid/collector interactions. We found in our experiments that the lowering of IS due to the reduction of water salt content, which could occur during runoff injections after rainfall, might be sufficient to cause strong detachment of viruses from fracture surfaces, allowing further migration into the groundwater. The model in this work can predict the count and pathways of released viruses in groundwater fractures under soil geochemical heterogeneity and originated by reductions of IS, by using analytical solutions.",0,698

In spite of this phenomenon having a psychodynamic nosography and descriptive models that effectively reveal it in detail, mental alienation is still mysterious and unsettling, especially when it manifests all of a sudden in clinical work. Alienating withdrawal into sensory fantasizing, which causes increasing loss of contact with human reality, is often preceded by a long period of time spent in a dissociated world that has gradually replaced psychic reality. However, prior to the human world being completely replaced by the alien world, both worlds coexisted for a considerable length of time in the patient’s mind. My hypothesis is that the dissociation from psychic reality that underlies the future state of psychotic alienation occurs in psychic withdrawal that begins in infancy.

After the development of technologies for observing and manipulating individual working molecules, experimental results negating the widely accepted 'lever-arm hypothesis' have been reported. In this paper, based on the experimental results so far accumulated, an alternative hypothesis is proposed, in which motor molecules are modelled as electromechanical components that interact with each other through electrostatic force. Electrostatic attractive force between myosin and actin is assumed to cause a conformational change in the myosin head during the attachment process. An elastic energy resulting from the conformational change then produces the power stroke. The energy released at the ATP hydrolysis is mainly used to detach the myosin head from actin filaments. The mechanism presented in this paper is compatible with the experimental results contradictory to the previous theories. It also explains the behavior of myosins V and VI, which are engaged in cellular transport and move processively along actin filaments.",0,701

Bio Systems 132-133: 1-5.","Myosins are typical molecular motor proteins that convert the chemical energy from the ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. The fundamental mechanism of this energy conversion is still unknown. To explain the experimental results already obtained, Masuda has proposed a hypothesis called the ""Driven by Detachment"" theory for the working principle of the myosins. This theory insists that the energy used during the power stroke of the myosins does not directly originate from the chemical energy of ATP, but is converted from the elastic energy within the molecule at the joint between the head and neck domains. One method for demonstrating the validity of this theory is a computational simulation using the molecular dynamics (MD) method. The MD software used was GROMACS. The target of the MD simulations was myosin subfragment-1 (S1), for which the initial structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank entry 1M8Q. The AFM pull code of GROMACS was used to apply an external force of 17 pN at the end of the neck domain in the direction opposite to the power stroke to observe whether the myosin S1 takes the pre-power stroke conformation. The residues assumed to be engaged in the docking with an actin filament were fixed to the space. Starting from exactly the same initial position, 10 simulations were repeated by varying the random seeds for generating the initial velocities of the atoms. After 64ns of calculations, the myosin S1 took the conformation of the pre-power stroke state in which the neck domain was bent around the joint between the head and the neck domains. This result agrees with the prediction expected by the DbD theory, the validity of which may be established by conducting similar simulations for the other steps of the myosin working processes.",0,702

Covariates included baseline systemic findings: age, gender, corticosteroid use, stress, shift work, sleep disorder, depression, allergy, cardiovascular risk; baseline optical coherence tomography findings: subfoveal choroidal thickness, pigment epithelial detachment pattern (regular/bump/irregular), number of subretinal hyperreflective foci at leakage site; baseline angiographic findings: fluorescein leakage intensity (intense/moderate/subtle/absent), hyperpermeability pattern on indocyanine-green angiography (focal/multifocal); and episode-related findings: duration and treatment of previous episode. RESULTS: Twenty of 46 subjects (43%) presented >/=1 recurrences during a mean follow-up of 29.9 +/- 9.5 months (range, 15-54 months). Follow-up duration did not differ between cases with or without recurrences (P = 0.3). Worse final visual acuity levels (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution) were associated with a higher number of episodes during follow-up (P = 0.032, r = 0.28). In a univariate analysis, higher subfoveal choroidal thickness (P = 0.021), nonintense fluorescein leakage (= moderate/subtle/absent, P = 0.033), multiple subretinal hyperreflective foci (P = 0.026), and shift work (P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with recurrences, with a near-significant influence of irregular pigment epithelial detachment (P = 0.093).

The objective of this study was to clarify changes in nurses' recognition and behaviors, as well as the intervention's post-initiation durability. The pediatric nursing care model (PNCM), defining 24 nursing approaches, was developed to show simple examples of ethical nursing practices for pediatric patients and their families. An intervention program included an initial session that consisted of a 30-minute mini-lecture. Nurses also described details of approaches previously performed and conducted a peer-review. Concerning the PNCM, the frequency of implementing each approach was examined using a 4-point Likert scale both before and at 2-month post-intervention initiation. Recognition of intervention feasibility was evaluated using a 4-point Likert scale at the end of the first session. Furthermore, during the second month, reflection and outcome content was evaluated by examining approaches the nurses performed and described. During the third month, the nurses were asked to describe changes in their behavior in terms of ethical nursing practices, along with those observed by patient and family responses, and any recognition of future challenges.

Environmental science & technology 41(15","Bromide and resting-cell bacteria tracer tests conducted in a sandy aquifer at the U.S. Geological Survey Cape Cod site in 1987 were reinterpreted using a three-dimensional stochastic approach. Bacteria transport was coupled to colloid filtration theory through functional dependence of local-scale colloid transport parameters upon hydraulic conductivity and seepage velocity in a stochastic advection-dispersion/attachment-detachment model. Geostatistical information on the hydraulic conductivity (K) field that was unavailable at the time of the original test was utilized as input. Using geostatistical parameters, a groundwater flow and particle-tracking model of conservative solute transport was calibrated to the bromide-tracer breakthrough data. An optimization routine was employed over 100 realizations to adjust the mean and variance of the natural-logarithm of hydraulic conductivity (InK) field to achieve best fit of a simulated, average bromide breakthrough curve. A stochastic particle-tracking model for the bacteria was run without adjustments to the local-scale colloid transport parameters. Good predictions of mean bacteria breakthrough were achieved using several approaches for modeling components of the system. Simulations incorporating the recent Tufenkji and Elimelech (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2004, 38, 529-536) correlation equation for estimating single collector efficiency were compared to those using the older Rajagopalan and Tien (AIChEJ. 1976, 22, 523-533) model. Both appeared to work equally well at predicting mean bacteria breakthrough using a constant mean bacteria diameter for this set of field conditions. Simulations using a distribution of bacterial cell diameters available from original field notes yielded a slight improvement in the model and data agreement compared to simulations using an average bacterial diameter. The stochastic approach based on estimates of local-scale parameters for the bacteria-transport process reasonably captured the mean bacteria transport behavior and calculated an envelope of uncertainty that bracketed the observations in most simulation cases.",0,708

Silicone oil typically appears hyperdense on computer tomography (CT) and hyperintense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR). These imaging findings may mimic a mass or blood products. However, MR imaging of silicone results in chemical shift artifact which should help narrow the imaging differential. We present a patient with incidental CT and MRI findings which resulted in a prolonged hospital course following misidentification of intraventricular silicone oil. Although the imaging differential for an intraventricular lesion may include metastasis, lymphoma, hemorrhage, choroid plexus papilloma/carcinoma, meningioma, subependymoma, and ependymoma, secondary imaging findings should be noted to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

On-going psychosocial stress and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are both associated with an attenuated clinical response to antidepressants. Preclinical data shows that co-administration of corticosteroids leads to a reduction in the ability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to increase forebrain 5-hydroxytryptamine, while co-administration of antiglucocorticoids has the opposite effect. A Cochrane review suggests that antiglucocorticoid augmentation of antidepressants may be effective in treating TRD and includes a pilot study of the cortisol synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone. The Antiglucocorticoid augmentation of anti-Depressants in Depression (The ADD Study) is a multicentre randomised placebo controlled trial of metyrapone augmentation of serotonergic antidepressants in a large population of patients with TRD in the UK National Health Service. Methods/design: Patients with moderate to severe treatment refractory Major Depression aged 18 to 65 will be randomised to metyrapone 500 mg twice daily or placebo for three weeks, in addition to on-going conventional serotonergic antidepressants. The primary outcome will be improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score five weeks after randomisation (i.e. two weeks after trial medication discontinuation). Secondary outcomes will include the degree of persistence of treatment effect for up to 6 months, improvements in quality of life and also safety and tolerability of metyrapone. The ADD Study will also include a range of sub-studies investigating the potential mechanism of action of metyrapone. Discussion: Strengths of the ADD study include broad inclusion criteria meaning that the sample will be representative of patients with TRD treated within the UK National Health Service, longer follow up, which to our knowledge is longer than any previous study of antiglucocorticoid treatments in depression, and the range of mechanistic investigations being carried out. The data set acquired will be a rich resource for a range of research questions relating to both refractory depression and the use of antiglucocorticoid treatments.

Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing 24(5","WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: People with learning disability are more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia. Personal recovery philosophies are based on positive attitudes and an optimism that recognizes and values people and their strengths and capacity to achieve goals. Little is known from previous studies about the illness perceptions of learning disability practitioners who work with people that experience both a learning disability and schizophrenia. The illness beliefs of learning disability practitioners about schizophrenia may mediate the potential for social exclusion and limit recovery outcomes. WHAT THIS STUDY/PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The findings show that the illness beliefs of learning disability practitioners and support workers regarding schizophrenia are pessimistic in terms of the consequences for people with schizophrenia and learning disability and their relatives as well as the chronic course of the illness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE?: This study identifies the nature of LD practitioner perceptions about schizophrenia and provides guidance about how personal recovery philosophies can be applied to the management of LD and schizophrenia. The beliefs of learning disability practitioners and support workers regarding schizophrenia need to be reframed to support better recovery outcomes and social inclusion for this group. The findings from this study can inform the development of training in bio-psycho-social models of schizophrenia, recovery approaches, family/carer interventions, clinical supervision, mentorship and reflection on clinical practice, which could be potentially useful strategies to help facilitate a reframing of beliefs.ABSTRACTBackground and purpose of study The prevalence of schizophrenia in people with learning disability is 3-4%. This is the first study to investigate the illness perceptions of learning disability (LD) practitioners towards people with schizophrenia. Methods Learning disability practitioners (n = 210) that work with people with LD and schizophrenia completed a modified version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire Schizophrenia Carers Version (IPQ-SCV). Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted for all of the IPQ-SCV subscales. Results A significant positive correlation was found between consequences relative and consequences patient (0.495, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation was found between timeline episodic and timeline chronic (-0.243, P < 0.001) subscales. Discussion Consistent with previous evidence found regarding negative staff attitudes to schizophrenia recovery outcomes, course and chronicity, the current investigation has extended and confirmed these observations to staff working with individuals with comorbid schizophrenia and learning disability. Implications for practice This study identifies the nature of LD practitioner perceptions about schizophrenia and contributes to the development of the recovery philosophy in relation to the management of LD and schizophrenia. The findings inform the design of training modules in bio-psycho-social models of schizophrenia, recovery approaches, family intervention, clinical supervision and reflection.

In this work we optimized the binding of human B-lymphocyte cells (HR1K) inside a microfluidic channel and determined the strength of this binding under shear stress of flowing liquid. In order to determine the parameters required for a live/dead test in microfluidic devices, populations of both living and dead cells were tested separately. Channels were prepared in glass-polydimethylsiloxane hybrid chips, with a self-assembled monolayer of 3-(glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) before covalently immobilizing anti-CD20 antibody. Without GPTMS linker, ∼90% of the CD20-expressing cells detached at 200 μl min-1 (the highest flow rate studied). With GPTMS linker, the bonding method proved critical for sustained immobilization of HR1K cells under flow. Masking the channel area during plasma bonding preserves the antibody functionality; the masked surface gives 15% cell detachment at 200 μl min-1 compared with 80% for an unmasked surface. Sealing the chip via clamping (without plasma treatment) was similar to masked plasma treatment (20% detachment) and allowing a post-adhesion stasis time (30 min) did not significantly change the relative cell detachment for the flow rates studied. Membrane integrity and calcium spiking behaviour were measured fluorescently, and demonstrated that the live cells retained comparable functionality to unanchored cells for the duration of the flow experiments. Non-viable HR1K cells were found to detach more readily, exhibiting only 20% cell retention at 200 μl min-1 compared with >80% for live cells.",0,713

Three sets of cells based on pristine PEDOT:PSS film, cosolvent enhanced PEDOT:PSS film using ethylene glycol as a cosolvent, and post-treated PEDOT:PSS film using a novel 1:1 binary mixture of ethylene glycol and methanol have been studied. Markedly different film conductivities have been found for the pristine (∼0.8 S/cm), cosolvent added (637 S/cm), and post-treated films (1334 S/cm). The photoconversion efficiency obtained over a large set of samples (72 cells) was used to evaluate the cosolvent addition and post-treatment. Post-treatment is found to reproducibly provide films with not only the highest conductivities but also the highest efficiencies along with higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor but lower short-circuit current density when compared to those of the cosolvent added films. The decrease in the latter is attributed to the increase in absorbance in the PEDOT:PSS film.

With the current voluntary 'opt-in' programmes clearly failing to adequately address this issue, the time has undoubtedly come for a new approach to vaccination to be implemented. Two different approaches to vaccination delivery have been suggested to rectify this situation, mandatory vaccination and 'opt-out' declination forms. It is suggested, however, that these two approaches are inadequate when used by themselves. In order to protect the most vulnerable patients in our healthcare facilities as best we can from serious harm or death caused by nosocomial transmission of influenza, while at the same time respecting HCWs autonomy, and in many jurisdictions, the related legal right to refuse medical treatment, it is recommended that 'op-out' declination forms should be used in conjunction with restricted mandatory vaccination.

Using CO2 and H2O-molecules that are expected to be abundant and widespread on habitable terrestrial planets-oxygenic photosynthesis is plausible as a significant planetary process with a global impact. Photosynthetic O2 has long been considered particularly robust as a sign of life on a habitable exoplanet, due to the lack of known ""false positives""-geological or photochemical processes that could also produce large quantities of stable O2. O2 has other advantages as a biosignature, including its high abundance and uniform distribution throughout the atmospheric column and its distinct, strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared. However, recent modeling work has shown that false positives for abundant oxygen or ozone could be produced by abiotic mechanisms, including photochemistry and atmospheric escape. Environmental factors for abiotic O2 have been identified and will improve our ability to choose optimal targets and measurements to guard against false positives. Most of these false-positive mechanisms are dependent on properties of the host star and are often strongest for planets orbiting M dwarfs. In particular, selecting planets found within the conservative habitable zone and those orbiting host stars more massive than 0.4 M⊙ (M3V and earlier) may help avoid planets with abundant abiotic O2 generated by water loss. Searching for O4 or CO in the planetary spectrum, or the lack of H2O or CH4, could help discriminate between abiotic and biological sources of O2 or O3. In advance of the next generation of telescopes, thorough evaluation of potential biosignatures-including likely environmental context and factors that could produce false positives-ultimately works to increase our confidence in life detection.

We show how two-tone suppression (TTS), a hallmark of cochlear nonlinearity, can be used as an indirect measure of HB stimulation. Using two different nonlinear computational models of the cochlea, we investigate the effect of altering the mechanical load applied by the tectorial membrane (TM) on the outer hair cell HB. In the first model (TM-A model), the TM is attached to the spiral limbus (as in wild-type animals); in the second model (TM-D model), the TM is detached from the spiral limbus (mimicking the cochlea of Otoa(EGFP/EGFP) mutant mice). As in recent experiments, model simulations demonstrate that the absence of the TM attachment does not preclude cochlear amplification. However, detaching the TM alters the mechanical load applied by the TM on the HB at low frequencies and therefore affects TTS by low-frequency suppressors. For low-frequency suppressors, the suppression threshold obtained with the TM-A model corresponds to a constant suppressor displacement on the basilar membrane (as in experiments with wild-type animals), whereas it corresponds to a constant suppressor velocity with the TM-D model. The predictions with the TM-D model could be tested by measuring TTS on the basilar membrane of the Otoa(EGFP/EGFP) mice to improve our understanding of the fundamental workings of the cochlea.",0,721

This change in attitude has been largely fostered by the extensive work of reflection on the involvement of the administrative authorities and the acquisition of new competences by carers, helping them to integrate this new mindset to the multitude of individual situations that can arise. By adopting a medical-social model, we have been able to move away from a 'care-based' system towards a 'support-based' system for helping clients with their sexuality. Professionals need theoretical and institutional landmarks in order to best meet client needs. Managers of care facilities must play a leading role in developing an institutional project for sexuality that will be a guideline for carers in deciding what action to take in a given situation to support the sexuality of residents.

Langmuir 34(40","Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have become increasingly exploited in biological applications, such as imaging and drug delivery. The application of SWNTs in biological settings requires the surface chemistry to remain through the low solubility in aqueous media. In this research, a facile approach for the preparation of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated SWNT-based nanocarrier was reported. We focused on the effect of PEG chain length and SWNT size on the cytotoxicity of PEG-coated SWNTs as a superior drug delivery nanovector. First, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to explore the stability and behavior of SWNT/pyrene-PEG (SWNT/Pyr-PEG) structures at a molecular level that is not attainable with experiments. The MD studies revealed that (i) pi-pi stacking interactions between the pyrene bearing PEG molecules and SWNTs are maintained in bulky situations, regardless of PEG molecular weight or SWNT size; (ii) pyrene molecules diffuse over the SWNT surface without detaching; and (iii) both short and long dynamic Pyr-PEG chains have the capability of effectively coating the SWNT surface. In light of the simulations, noncovalent (pi-pi stacking) assemblies of SWNT/Pyr-PEG with different molecular weights of PEG ( Mw = 2000, 5000, and 12000) were successfully fabricated and characterized. For longer PEG chains, more effective coating of SWNTs was obtained, resulting in more biocompatible SWNT/Pyr-PEG nanomaterials. The number of SWNTs coated by Pyr-PEG was highly dependent on the length of pyrene bearing PEG polymers. Moreover, the short SWNTs showed a higher amount of PEG coating with respect to the long SWNTs. Cell viability results demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxicity of coated SWNTs. Short SWNTs coated with longer PEG chains have low cytotoxicity to be used in in vivo studies.",0,729

As is well known, the main disadvantage of least-squares fitting is its sensitivity to outliers. The elimination from the data set of the most aberrant reflections (due to both experimental errors and incompleteness of the model) is an effective practice that could yield satisfactory results, but it is often complicated in the presence of a great number of bad data points, whose one-by-one elimination could become unattainable. This problem can be circumvented by means of a robust least-squares regression that minimizes the influence of outliers. This work is aimed at showing the capability of a robust regression to achieve an higher reliability of the least-squares estimates with respect to the traditional weighted least-squares crystal structure refinement in terms of both accuracy and precision. The results can be considered encouraging and represent a starting point for future developments.",0,730

In so doing, the Board went far beyond the vision of its congressional creators, the most relevant federal agencies, and the field itself. The dedication, daring, collegiality, and public spirit of the drafters and ultimately the moral and intellectual power of the reports themselves were awe-inspiring, as was the level of public attention given to the Board's initial declaration of a national emergency. However, the specific effects on policy were quite limited. Possible reasons for the enormous gap between the strength of the Board's vision and the weakness of its implementation are reviewed.

Method: We searched SciELO, Scopus, ScienceDirect, MEDLINE, OneFile (GALE), SpringerLink, Cambridge Journals and Web of Science between February and March of 2014 for studies whose title and topic included the following keywords: cognitive rumination; rumination response scale; and self-reflection. The inclusion criteria were: empirical clinical study; CR as the main object of investigation; and study that included a conceptual definition of CR. The studies selected were published in English in biomedical journals in the last 10 years. Our phenomenological analysis was based on Karl Jaspers’ General Psychopathology. Results: Most current empirical studies adopt phenomenological cognitive elements in conceptual definitions. However, these elements do not seem to be carefully examined and are indistinctly understood as objective empirical factors that may be measured, which may contribute to misunderstandings about CR, erroneous interpretations of results and problematic theoretical models. Conclusion: Empirical studies fail when evaluating phenomenological aspects of the cognitive elements of the CR construct. Psychopathology and phenomenology may help define the characteristics of CR elements and may contribute to their understanding and hierarchical organization as a construct. A review of the psychopathology principles established by Jasper may clarify some of these issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,732

This is aligned along an interneural plane and makes the approach truly minimally invasive. This technique is performed in a lateral decubitus position on a normal operating table; there is no need for a specific orthopaedic or fracture table. As leg traction is not necessary, this enables the approach to be used routinely. Most of the instruments used for this procedure are standard instruments; only the acetabular reamers and positioners are angulated and specifically designed. The angled instruments (MI minimally invasive) are especially useful when performing hip replacement in obese patients. An excellent view of both the acetabulum and the proximal femur can be obtained through an incision of only 6-8cm, using this MI approach. The approach follows the interval between the tensor fascia lata muscle and the rectus muscle using a section of the anterior iliofemoral approach described by Smith-Petersen. No tendon or muscle is cut or detached. The joint capsule is split and left in place. The hip joint is not dislocated and we perform the osteotomy of the femoral neck in situ. To date we have performed over 500 MicroHip operations. We have not observed any nerve lesions or fractures of the trochanter. Our experience to date shows that the method we have de-veloped allows us to operate reliably on virtually any patient.

(2005"," ""Energetic and topological analyses of the oxidation reaction between Mo(n","The interaction between molybdenum, atom, and dimer, with nitrous oxide has been investigated using density functional theory. The analysis of the potential energy surfaces for both reactions has revealed that a single molybdenum atom can activate the N--O bond of N2O requiring a small activation energy. However, the presence of several intersystem crossings between three different spin states, namely, septet, quintet and triplet states, seems to be the major constraint to the Mo + N2O reaction. Contrarily, the low-lying excited states (triplet and quintet) do not participate in the reaction between the molybdenum dimer and N2O. The latter reaction fully evolves on the singlet spin surface. Three different regions have been distinguished along the pathway: formation of an adduct complex, formation of an inserted compound, and the N2 detachment. The connection between the two first regions has been characterized by the formation of a special complex in which the N--O bond is so weakened that it could be considered as a first step in the insertion process. It has been shown that the topological changes along the pathways provide a clear explanation for the geometrical changes that occur along the reaction pathway. In summary, the detachment of the N2 molecule is found to be kinetically an effective process for both reactions, owing to the high exothermicity and consequently to the high internal energy of the insertion intermediates. However, in the case of Mo atom, the reaction should be a slow process due to the presence of spin-forbidden transitions. These results fully agree with previous experimental works.",0,735

It is assumed that there is a cumulative disturbance called ""background,"" which describes mentioned distortions in the coherent imaging system manifested at the sensor plane. Here we propose a novel iterative phase-retrieval algorithm compensating for these distortions in the optical system. An estimate of this background is obtained via special calibration experiments, and then it is used for the object reconstruction. The algorithm is based on the maximum likelihood approach targeting on the optimal object reconstruction from noisy data and imaging enhancement using a priori information on the object amplitude.

Intrusive memory vividness was not significantly associated with depression. There were insufficient data to examine the relationship between depression and memory vantage perspective. Between‐study heterogeneity was high for intrusive memory frequency and memory avoidance, and the percentage of females in studies significantly moderated the relationship between these variables and depression. An additional exploratory meta‐analysis (3 studies; N = 257) indicated that intrusive memories were experienced more frequently by those with posttraumatic stress disorder than those with depression. Overall, the findings suggest that intrusive memories warrant clinical attention as they may contribute to the maintenance of depressive symptomatology.

It was shown that the length of what was removed during discharge part of specimens in most of the cases was several orders greater than that of an initial radius of the specimen apex. Experimental results obtained in this work indicate that electrical breakdown in field-ion microscopes is initiated by the impact of nanoparticles detached from a point anode in a high electric field. A new approach for explanation of an observed specimen failure in a high electric field was proposed, where the formation and expansion of the cathode plasma play the key role in the mechanical rupture and melting of field-ion tips. The expanding plasma behaves as a dynamic capacitor plate characterized by a high velocity and increasing field strength at the specimen tip. The field rise rate at a constant voltage in a dynamic plasma-to-tip capacitor is of the order of >10(20)V/m/s.

Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials 3(3","Fundamental to the development and application of biomedical devices is an understanding of the adhesion of cells to substrates. There are many experimental techniques and papers dedicated to the study of cell adhesion. This work aims to elucidate on the cell detachment mechanism in a recently reported cell adhesion measurement experiment by laser-induced stress wave technique. In the experiment the absorption of an Nd:YAG laser pulse generates a stress wave of nanoseconds duration that interacts with and detaches the cell adhered to a Si substrate. Due to the ultra-short timescale involved in the experiment, details of the detachment process were not readily observable. In this work, dynamic finite element method is used to simulate the cell-substrate decohesion process under the laser-induced stress wave loading. The results show that the combined effect of nanosecond stress wave pulse and the specific cell geometry results in a complex stress-strain state along the cell-substrate interface. The principal failure mechanism is large interfacial strains realized from the cell's tendency to spread and elongate on the substrate as a result of substrate acceleration. The cells behave like a soft elastic solid during the detachment process due to the large difference between their characteristic response time and the ultra-short duration of the applied stress wave. Evolution of the cell geometry from hydrophobic to hydrophilic contact results in the same detachment process.",0,742

We categorized the domain of knowledge, methods, topical content, whether articles represented core values of primary care, and looked for articles that studied health/illness/symptoms from a uniquely primary care experience. We reconciled differences by discussion.RESULTSAmong 110 articles, knowledge domains reflected the 4 quadrants of the clinician (n = 6), patient, family, or community (10), health care system (32), disease (22), or the interface (39) between these quadrants. The most frequent methods were cross-sectional studies (23), cohorts (15), randomized clinical trials (13), qualitative interviews (11), analyses of secondary data (11), systematic reviews (11), methods/theory development (10), self-reflections (8), and mixed methods (5). The most common topical areas were chronic disease and prevention. Core primary care values were represented in 75% of articles. Only 2 articles represented an integrative illness/healing perspective.CONCLUSIONSDespite contemporary forces driving a reductionistic approach, primary care research, as reflected by articles published in the Annals of Family Medicine, addresses the domains of knowledge that contribute to comprehensive, relationship-centered health care.

However Australian family therapists have also made their own significant contributions to theory and practice. The vastness of the continent combined with a relatively small population has presented challenges with respect to the formation of a national association and for many years, the Australian Journal of Family Therapy (later the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy Board acted as de facto national voice for the discipline. The Australian Association of Family Therapy was formed as recently as 2011. It has a total of over 1,000 members and is the sole organisation representing family therapy and family therapists in Australia. Clinical membership is achieved via successful completion of a 2-year sequence of study in family therapy followed by 50 hours of supervision (or its equivalent). Family Therapy training is mostly delivered in the four most populated states in Australia at both University level and through private organisations registered to provide training at government approved levels. La Trobe University (through the Bouverie Centre), Swinburne University (through the Williams Road Family Therapy Centre) and the University of New South Wales currently provide training leading to specialist qualification in family therapy. A number of other private institutions also provide recognised family therapy training. To date, family therapists and couple therapists in Australia have not in the main shared common platforms such as conferences, training and professional journals. Narrative therapy has also remained somewhat detached from 'mainstream' family therapy. Family therapy qualifications are often valued by prospective employers even when duty statements are focused on the more traditional skills of professionals such as psychologists or social workers.

Sensors (Basel, Switzerland","Nondestructive Testing (NDT) assessment of materials' health condition is useful for classifying healthy from unhealthy structures or detecting flaws in metallic or dielectric structures. Performing structural health testing for coated/uncoated metallic or dielectric materials with the same testing equipment requires a testing method that can work on metallics and dielectrics such as microwave testing. Reducing complexity and expenses associated with current diagnostic practices of microwave NDT of structural health requires an effective and intelligent approach based on feature selection and classification techniques of machine learning. Current microwave NDT methods in general based on measuring variation in the S-matrix over the entire operating frequency ranges of the sensors. For instance, assessing the health of metallic structures using a microwave sensor depends on the reflection or/and transmission coefficient measurements as a function of the sweeping frequencies of the operating band. The aim of this work is reducing sweeping frequencies using machine learning feature selection techniques. By treating sweeping frequencies as features, the number of top important features can be identified, then only the most influential features (frequencies) are considered when building the microwave NDT equipment. The proposed method of reducing sweeping frequencies was validated experimentally using a waveguide sensor and a metallic plate with different cracks. Among the investigated feature selection techniques are information gain, gain ratio, relief, chi-squared. The effectiveness of the selected features were validated through performance evaluations of various classification models; namely, Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Results showed good crack classification accuracy rates after employing feature selection algorithms.",0,752

B, Biointerfaces 81(1","This paper describes a controlled way to immobilize gold nanoparticles on planar gold surfaces and the use of the resulting 3D platform to build up a 3D biosensor. The surface was first functionalized by grafting hexanedithiol, this molecule has 2 thiol end groups, which enables its chemical grafting to planar gold while retaining a free thiol group to attach nanoparticles. This step was optimized by varying experimental parameters such as solvent, temperature and immersion time. The grafting was monitored by polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The high resolution XPS sulfur peak made clear the existence of two contributions, S bound to gold and free S, thus led us to determine the optimal conditions to graft hexanedithiol in an extended conformation. 15 nm spherical gold nanoparticles were then immobilized on the resulting surface and their presence was evidenced by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The resulting gold layer was used to build up a 3D biosensor by grafting protein A (PrA), rabbit immunoglobulin (rIgG), and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively. Each step was characterized by PM-IRRAS then compared to the results on planar gold surface. Despite the small size of particles and their rather low density on the planar surface, the amount of immobilized proteins, starting from PrA, was almost doubled. The amount of rIgG fixed on the 3D layer was also significantly increased ( approximately 4 times higher than on planar surfaces), however accompanied by a slight decrease of their accessibility, checked by assaying the recognition of a secondary IgG. This work demonstrates the feasibility and interest of building arrays of nanoparticles to immobilize molecular receptors; it also shows that controlling the conditions of elaboration of the biosensor at each step is determining for optimizing the number of molecular receptors.",0,760

The EMBO journal 23(11","Neuronal transmission of information requires polarized distribution of membrane proteins within axonal compartments. Membrane proteins are synthesized and packaged in membrane-bounded organelles (MBOs) in neuronal cell bodies and later transported to axons by microtubule-dependent motor proteins. Molecular mechanisms underlying targeted delivery of MBOs to discrete axonal subdomains (i.e. nodes of Ranvier or presynaptic terminals) are poorly understood, but regulatory pathways for microtubule motors may be an essential step. In this work, pharmacological, biochemical and in vivo experiments define a novel regulatory pathway for kinesin-driven motility in axons. This pathway involves enzymatic activities of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). Inhibition of CDK5 activity in axons leads to activation of GSK3 by PP1, phosphorylation of kinesin light chains by GSK3 and detachment of kinesin from transported cargoes. We propose that regulating the activity and localization of components in this pathway allows nerve cells to target organelle delivery to specific subcellular compartments.

However, no evidence was found for an equivalent I*(aq) charge-transfer absorption, and I((2)P(3/2)) was produced within the instrument response.

Our aim was to examine relationships between OCD symptoms, depression and functioning before and after exposure and response prevention (ERP), a type of cognitive-behavioural therapy for OCD, specifically examining whether functioning, depression and other cognitive factors like rumination and worry acted as mediators. METHODS: Forty-four individuals with OCD were randomised to 4 weeks of intensive ERP treatment first (n = 23) or waitlist then treatment (n = 21). We used a bootstrapping method to examine mediation models. RESULTS: OCD symptoms, depression and functioning significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention. Functioning mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and depression and the relationship between functioning and depression was stronger at post-treatment. Depression mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and functioning, but only at post-intervention. Similarly, rumination mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and depression at post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that after ERP, relationships between depression and functioning become stronger. Following ERP, treatment that focuses on depression and functioning, including medication management for depression, cognitive approaches targeting rumination, and behavioural activation to boost functionality may be important clinical interventions for OCD patients.",0,767

Hormones and Behavior 105: 146-156.","Maternal melatonin provides photoperiodic information to the fetus and thus influences the regulation and timing of the offspring's internal rhythms and preparation for extra-uterine development. There is clinical evidence that melatonin deprivation of both mother and fetus during pregnancy, and of the neonate during lactation, results in negative long-term health outcomes. As a consequence, we hypothesized that the absence of maternal pineal melatonin might determine abnormal brain programming in the offspring, which would lead to long-lasting implications for behavior and brain function. To test our hypothesis, we investigated in rats the effects of maternal melatonin deprivation during gestation and lactation (MMD) to the offspring and the effects of its therapeutic replacement. The parameters evaluated were: (1) somatic, physical growth and neurobehavioral development of pups of both sexes; (2) hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory of the male offspring; (3) adult hippocampal neurogenesis of the male offspring. Our findings show that MMD significantly delayed male offspring's onset of fur development, pinna detachment, eyes opening, eruption of superior incisor teeth, testis descent and the time of maturation of palmar grasp, righting reflex, free-fall righting and walking. Conversely, female offspring neurodevelopment was not affected. Later on, male offspring show that MMD was able to disrupt both spatial reference and working memory in the Morris Water Maze paradigm and these deficits correlate with changes in the number of proliferative cells in the hippocampus. Importantly, all the observed impairments were reversed by maternal melatonin replacement therapy. In summary, we demonstrate that MMD delays the appearance of physical features, neurodevelopment and cognition in the male offspring, and points to putative public health implications for night shift working mothers.

This article begins with a brief account of both of these avant garde metalation methods focusing on selected recent examples not covered previously in a review. New results in the area of Alkali-Metal Mediated Alumination (AMMAl) are also presented. Thus, the putative lithium aluminate base THF·Li(μ-TMP)(2)Al((i)Bu)(2) (4) is shown to act via TMP basicity to efficiently ortho deprotonate a variety of functionalized aromatic molecules at room temperature, tolerating carboxamide and halide functionalities. These metalated species are electrophilically quenched with elemental iodine. Crystal structure determinations of the metalated intermediates confirm unequivocally that direct alumination of the substrates has occurred. Since the homometallic lithium or aluminum reagents are unable to effect such deprotonations these reactions are synergic in nature and can be considered examples of AMMAl. Drawing together previously published work in the field of AMMAl, together with other pertinent experimental observations and new density functional theory (DFT) computational studies, we propose a potential rationale for the ""unusual"" reactivity patterns witnessed in this branch of heterometallic synthetic chemistry with respect to other Alkali Metal Mediated Metalations which appear to behave in a more conventional manner.",0,771

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy and long-term safety of the new Matrix coil system.METHODSMatrix coils consist of thin platinum coils covered with a bioabsorbable, polymeric material (polyglycolic acid/lactide). Fifty-two experimental aneurysms were created in 26 swine. All of the aneurysms were tightly packed with Matrix or Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC). Comparative angiographic and histopathologic data were analyzed at 2 weeks (n=14), 3 months (n=6), and 6 months (n=6) after embolization.RESULTSThree aneurysms treated with GDC ruptured despite tight packing. No recanalization or rupturing was observed in the aneurysms embolized with Matrix coils. At 14 days after embolization, the aneurysms treated with Matrix coils exhibited a more extensive area of organized thrombus when compared with the aneurysms treated with GDC (87% versus 75%, P=0.008, n=11). At 3 months, both Matrix and GDC-treated aneurysms demonstrated complete clot organization. Neck tissue thickness was higher in Matrix-treated aneurysms at 14 days and 3 months, but not at 6 months. No untoward parent artery stenosis was observed in aneurysms treated with Matrix during follow-up. The angiographic cross-sectional area of the Matrix-treated aneurysms was smaller than those treated with GDC at the 3 months.CONCLUSIONSMatrix accelerated aneurysm fibrosis and neointima formation without parent artery stenosis.

Even though it has been extensively studied, its pathophysiology remains nebulous. Over the last two decades, cerebral imaging has increasingly been used to aid the investigation of pain and headache disorders. Pioneering work using magnetic resonance-based, voxel-based morphometry depicted an isolated increase of grey matter in the posterior hypothalamus and thereby reconfirmed the most commonly accepted pathophysiological concept. More recent works demonstrate structural changes across multiple structures related to pain processing, sensory integration, and emotional evaluation. These changes do not seem to be static, but rather appear to be dynamic in nature as they change over the course of the disease. This was interpreted as a reflection of the plasticity of the human brain and should guide future thoughts towards a more complex pathophysiological model involving a maladaptive pain modulatory network.",0,776

Journal of Clinical Nursing 17(24","AIMS AND OBJECTIVESThis paper aims to forecast the total number of non-working nursing staff in Japan both overall and in terms of separate age groups for assistant nurses and fully qualified nurses. This also examines policy implications of those forecasts.BACKGROUNDAlthough the existence of around 550,000 of non-working nursing staff has been announced, the actual number of non-working nurses is not so clear that we might make errors in making policy to meet nurse workforce demand and supply in Japan.DESIGN AND METHODEstimations by integrating various data on the quantitative characteristics of non-working nursing staff were carried out. Considering the length and the type of education or training in referred four nursing positions; registered nurses, assistant nurses, public health nurses and midwives, we first estimated the number of students who completed a full course. And then multiplying by the ratio for gender and age classifications at the time of entry into courses, the number of those who obtained licenses was estimated.RESULTSThe number of non-working nurses was estimated at 100,000 higher than those in 2005 by government. Looking at age group, it is also possible to see a strong reflection of an employment pattern that follows the life cycle of female workers. Further analysis of life cycle effects and cohort effects proved the effect of life cycles even when subtracting the differences between the working behaviours of different generations.CONCLUSIONSOur findings strongly suggest the need to provide an urgent policy that workplace conditions can be created in which a balance between work and family is achievable. Moreover, to empower clinical activity, we also believe there is an urgent need to reexamine the overall career vision for assistant nurses including in terms of compensation. Relevance to clinical practice. Our findings strongly suggests that consideration for work-life balance of nursing staff; particularly, female staff is all the more important to provide a stable quality care.",0,777

Biophysical journal 92(10","The extracellular space of the brain is the heterogeneous porous medium formed by the spaces between the brain cells. Diffusion in this interstitial space is the mechanism by which glucose and oxygen are delivered to the brain cells from the vascular system. It is also a medium for the transport of certain informational substances between the cells (called volume transmission), and for drug delivery. This work involves three-dimensional modeling of the extracellular space as void space in close-packed arrays of fluid membrane vesicles. These packings are generated by minimizing the configurational energy using a Monte Carlo procedure. Both regular and random packs of vesicles are considered. A random walk algorithm is then used to compute the geometric tortuosities, and the results are compared with published experimental data. For the random packings, it is found that although the absolute values for the tortuosities differ, the dependence of the tortuosity on pore volume fraction is very similar to that observed in experiment. The tortuosities we measure are larger than those computed in previous studies of packings of convex polytopes, and modeling improvements, which require higher resolution studies and an improved modeling of brain cell shapes and mechanical properties, could help resolve remaining discrepancies between model simulations and experiment. It is also shown that the specular reflection scheme is the appropriate technique for implementing zero-flux boundary conditions in random walk simulations commonly encountered in diffusion problems.",0,778

In this work, we unify these concepts in a new hybrid metal-semiconductor surface that offers both strong light absorption and high electrical conductivity. We use metal-assisted chemical etching to nanostructure the surface of a silicon wafer, creating an array of silicon nanopillars protruding through holes in a gold film. When coated with a silicon nitride anti-reflection layer, we observe broad-band absorption of up to 97% in this structure, which is remarkable considering that metal covers 60% of the top surface. We use optical simulations to show that Mie-like resonances in the nanopillars funnel light around the metal layer and into the substrate, rendering the metal nearly transparent to the incoming light. Our results show that, across a wide parameter space, hybrid metal-semiconductor surfaces with absorption above 90% and sheet resistance below 20 Ω/□ are realizable, suggesting a new paradigm wherein transparent electrodes and photon management textures are designed and fabricated together to create high-performance optoelectronic interfaces.",0,779

The consequent stress-strain state on peri-implant bone tissue must be carefully considered because of the significant effects induced.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe case of a two-implant prosthesis connected by a titanium cast bar in the pre-molar mandible region is investigated. The complex geometry requires the use of refined finite element model. In consideration of the action induced on the bone tissue, a specific constitutive model that includes inelastic behavior is implemented. The linear misfits considered, estimated with reference to experimental works already present in the literature, induce relevant strains in the peri-implant bone tissue up to a post-elastic phase. Relaxation phenomena are also evaluated. The interaction between the bone and implant is modeled by using contact elements to represent possible detachments at the bone-implant interface.RESULTSThe response of the bone material is reported with regard to the stress/strain field induced, evaluating the inelastic behavior in terms of plastic and relaxation responses. The effects on the peri-implant bone tissue at the interface are evaluated.SIGNIFICANCEThe analysis confirms that the interaction phenomena between the multi-implant oral prostheses and bone induced by the misfit defects of normal intensity induce significant strain in the bone tissue and inelastic phenomena must be taken into account.

However, the biomonitoring of atmospheric pollution can be compromised in urban contexts if the targeted biomonitors are regularly disturbed, irregularly distributed, or are difficult to access. Here, we test the hypothesis that cemeteries are appropriate moss sampling sites for the evaluation of air pollution in urban areas. We sampled mosses growing on gravestones in 21 urban and peri-urban cemeteries in the Paris metropolitan area. We focused on Grimmia pulvinata (Hedwig) Smith, a species abundantly found in all studied cemeteries and very common in Europe. The concentration of Al, As, Br, Ca, Ce, Cl, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, V, P, Pb, Rb, S, Sr, Ti, and Zn was determined by a total reflection X-ray fluorescence technique coupled with a slurry sampling method (slurry-TXRF). This method avoids a digestion step, reduces the risk of sample contamination, and works even at low sample quantities. Elemental markers of road traffic indicated that the highest polluted cemeteries were located near the highly frequented Parisian ring road and under the influence of prevailing winds. The sites with the lowest pollution were found not only in the peri-urban cemeteries, adjoining forest or farming landscapes, but also in the large and relatively wooded cemeteries located in the center of Paris. Our results suggest that (1) slurry-TXRF might be successfully used with moss material, (2) G. pulvinata might be a good biomonitor of trace metals air pollution in urban context, and (3) cemetery moss sampling could be a useful complement for monitoring urban areas. Graphical abstract We tested the hypothesis that cemeteries are appropriate moss sampling sites for the evaluation of air pollution in urban areas. We sampled 110 moss cushions (Grimmia pulvinata) growing on gravestones in 21 urban and peri-urban cemeteries in the Paris metropolitan area. The concentration of 20 elements in mosses was determined by a total reflection X-ray fluorescence technique coupled with a slurry sampling method. Statistical analysis revealed that: - Urbanized Parisian areas crossed by traffic roads have the highest polluted cemeteries with a strong influence of main wind direction on the distribution of air pollutants - As expected, small cemeteries with low tree density were heavily polluted - Less obvious, large green spaces such as large cemeteries (Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse) in the center of a dense metropolis like Paris present the same level of atmospheric trace metal pollution as cemeteries in less urbanized areas or nearing a very large forest. This suggests that even in densely urbanized areas, there is more spatial variability in pollution distribution than usually assumed and that large urban areas with low traffic and green filters such as trees are likely to intercept air pollutants.",0,781

In this regard, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has been widely used to wash fouled membranes for maintenance and recovery purposes. Advanced chemical and biological characterization was conducted in this work to evaluate the performance of aqueous NaOCl solutions during washing of polyacrylonitrile membranes. Fouled membranes from MBR operations supplemented with artificial wastewater were washed with 0.1% and 0.5% aqueous NaOCl solutions for 5, 10 and 30 min. The changes in organics composition on the membrane surface were directly monitored by an attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectrometer. In addition, high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was applied to detect any residual microorganisms. Results from ATR-FT-IR analysis indicated the complete disappearance of functional groups representing different fouling compounds after at least 30 min of treatment with 0.1% NaOCl. However, the biomolecular survey revealed the presence of residual bacteria even after 30 min of treatment with 0.5% NaOCl solution. Evaluation of microbial diversity of treated samples using Chao1, Shannon and Simpson reciprocal indices showed an increase in evenness while no significant decline in richness was observed. These implied that only the population of dominant species was mainly affected. The high-resolution phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of numerous operational taxonomic units (OTUs) whose close relatives exhibit halotolerance. Some OTUs related to thermophilic and acid-resistant strains were also identified. Finally, the taxonomic analysis of recycled membranes that were previously washed with NaOCl also showed the presence of numerous halotolerant-related OTUs in the early stage of fouling. This further suggested the possible contribution of such chemical tolerance on their survival against NaOCl washing, which in turn affected their re-fouling potential.",0,782

Science and technology of advanced materials 13(4","Porous silicon (PSi) is widely used in biological experiments, owing to its biocompatibility and well-established fabrication methods that allow tailoring its surface. Nevertheless, there are some unresolved issues such as deciding whether the stabilization of PSi is necessary for its biological applications and evaluating the effects of PSi stabilization on the surface biofunctionalization with proteins. In this work we demonstrate that non-stabilized PSi is prone to detachment owing to the stress induced upon biomolecular adsorption. Biofunctionalized non-stabilized PSi loses the interference properties characteristic of a thin film, and groove-like structures resulting from a final layer collapse were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Likewise, direct PSi derivatization with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTS) does not stabilize PSi against immunoglobulin biofunctionalization. To overcome this problem, we developed a simple chemical process of stabilizing PSi (CoxPSi) for biological applications, which has several advantages over thermal stabilization (ToxPSi). The process consists of chemical oxidation in H2O2, surface derivatization with APTS and a curing step at 120 °C. This process offers integral homogeneous PSi morphology, hydrophilic surface termination (contact angle θ = 26°) and highly efficient derivatized and biofunctionalized PSi surfaces (six times more efficient than ToxPSi). All these features are highly desirable for biological applications, such as biosensing, where our results can be used for the design and optimization of the biomolecular immobilization cascade on PSi surfaces.",0,783

Biochimie 93(7","Tributyltin (TBT), a persistent lipophilic contaminant found especially in the aquatic environment, is known to be toxic to mitochondria with the F(1)F(0)-ATPase as main target. Recently our research group pointed out that in mussel digestive gland mitochondria TBT, apart from decreasing the catalytic efficiency of Mg-ATPase activity, at concentrations ≥1.0 μM in the ATPase reaction medium lessens the enzyme inhibition promoted by the specific inhibitor oligomycin. The present work aims at casting light on the mechanisms involved in the TBT-driven enzyme desensitization to inhibitors, a poorly explored field. The mitochondrial Mg-ATPase desensitization is shown to be confined to inhibitors of transmembrane domain F(0), namely oligomycin and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). Accordingly, quercetin, which binds to catalytic portion F(1), maintains its inhibitory efficiency in the presence of TBT. Among the possible mechanisms involved in the Mg-ATPase desensitization to oligomycin by ≥1.0 μM TBT concentrations, a structural detachment of the two F(1) and F(0) domains does not occur according to experimental data. On the other hand TBT covalently binds to thiol groups on the enzyme structure, which are apparently only available at TBT concentrations approaching 20 μM. TBT is able to interact with multiple sites on the enzyme structure by bonds of different nature. While electrostatic interactions with F(0) proton channel are likely to be responsible for the ATPase activity inhibition, possible changes in the redox state of thiol groups on the protein structure due to TBT binding may promote structural changes in the enzyme structure leading to the observed F(1)F(0)-ATPase oligomycin sensitivity loss.",0,786

Theoretical considerations indicate that the stress distribution in the contact zone is crucial for the detachment mechanism, but direct experimental evidence is missing so far. In this work, we propose a method that allows, for the first time, the detection of local stresses at the contact area of biomimetic adhesive microstructures during contact formation, compression and detachment. We use a mechano-sensitive polymeric layer, which turns mechanical stresses into changes of fluorescence intensity. The biomimetic surface is brought into contact with this layer in a well-defined fashion using a microcontact printer, while the contact area is monitored with fluorescence microscopy in situ. Thus, changes in stress distribution across the contact area during compression and pull-off can be visualized with a lateral resolution of 1 μm. We apply this method to study the enhanced adhesive performance of T-shaped micropillars, compared to flat punch microstructures. We find significant differences in the stress distribution of the both differing contact geometries during pull-off. In particular, we find direct evidence for the suppression of crack nucleation at the edge of T-shaped pillars, which confirms theoretical models for the superior adhesive properties of these structures.",0,787

When the temperature is lowered below its lower critical solution temperature ( approximately 32 degrees C), pNIPAM rapidly hydrates, and adherent cells detach as intact cell sheets. This cell-releasing behavior in a physiologically relevant temperature range has led to NIPAM's use for engineered tissues and other devices. In a previous study, however, the authors found that although most techniques used to polymerize NIPAM yield biocompatible films, some formulations from commercially-available NIPAM (cpNIPAM) can be cytotoxic. In this work, the authors investigate the reasons underlying this anomaly. The authors evaluated the response of a variety of cell types (e.g., bovine aortic endothelial cells, BAECs; monkey kidney epithelial cells, Vero cells; and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 3T3s) after culture on substrates spin-coated with sol-gel (spNIPAM) and commercially-prepared (cpNIPAM). The relative biocompatibility of each cell type was evaluated using observations of its cell morphology and function (e.g., XTT and Live/Dead assays) after 48 and 96 h in culture. In addition, the substrates themselves were analyzed using NMR, goniometry, and XPS. The authors find that all the cell types were compromised by 96 h in culture with cpNIPAM, although the manner in which the cells are compromised differs; in particular, while Vero and 3T3 cells appear to be undergoing cytotoxic death, BAECs undergo apoptic death. The authors believe that this result is due to a combination of factors, including the presence of short chain oligomers of NIPAM in the commercially-available preparation. This work will provide valuable insights into the cytotoxicity of commercially-prepared polymer substrates for this type of bioengineering work and therefore into the applicability of cells grown on such surfaces for human subjects.",0,789

A single-wavelength telecentric imaging system in DHM was originally proposed to circumvent the residual parabolic phase distortion due to the microscope objective (MO) in standard nontelecentric DHM configurations. However, telecentric configurations cannot compensate for higher order phase aberrations. As an extension to the telecentric and nontelecentric arrangements in single-wavelength DHM (SW-DHM), we propose multiple-wavelength telecentric DHM (MW-TDHM) in reflection and transmission modes. The advantages of MW-TDHM configurations are to extend the vertical measurement range without phase ambiguity and optically remove the parabolic phase distortion caused by the MO in traditional MW-DHM. These configurations eliminate the need for a second reference hologram to subtract the two-phase maps and make digital automatic aberration compensation easier to apply compared to nontelecentric configurations. We also discuss a reconstruction algorithm that eliminates the zero-order and virtual images using spatial filtering and another algorithm that minimizes the intensity of fluctuations using apodization. In addition, we employ two polynomial models using 2D surface fitting to compensate digitally for chromatic aberration (in the multiwavelength case) and for higher order phase aberrations. A custom-developed user-friendly graphical user interface is employed to automate the reconstruction processes for all configurations.

Here we review the numerous early studies that suggest an important potential role for anti-VEGF agents in the management of diabetic retinopathy.CONCLUSIONSFor diabetic macular edema, phase II trials of intravitreal pegaptanib and intravitreal ranibizumab have shown short-term benefit in visual acuity. Intravitreal bevacizumab also has been shown to have beneficial short-term effects on both visual acuity and retinal thickness. For proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), early studies suggest that intravitreal bevacizumab temporarily decreases leakage from diabetic neovascular lesions, but this treatment may be associated with tractional retinal detachment (TRD). Furthermore, several studies indicate that bevacizumab is likely to prove a helpful adjunct to diabetic pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for TRD. Finally, three small series suggest a potential beneficial effect of a single dose of bevacizumab to prevent worsening of DME after cataract surgery.

The first aim of the study was to explore the association between emotional instability and paranoia. The second and third aims were to investigate whether the use of maladaptive ER strategies leads to paranoia in patients with psychosis in daily life and whether the use of more adaptive ER strategies reduces paranoia. DESIGN: A prospective momentary assessment study over the course of 6 days was performed. METHOD: Participants with psychosis (n = 32) reported repeatedly over six consecutive days on the presence and instability of positive and negative emotions, their use of adaptive (reappraisal, acceptance, distraction, social sharing, reflection) and maladaptive ER strategies (rumination, expressive suppression) and momentary paranoia in their daily life. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that patients with psychosis who presented pronounced instability of negative emotions showed more severe levels of state paranoia. In addition, patients with psychosis who used expressive suppression when confronted with negative emotions at one point in time presented more pronounced levels of state paranoia at the following point in time. CONCLUSION: The results presented here suggest that both emotional instability and the use of expressive suppression might cause state paranoia and thus add to our understanding of causal mechanisms related to paranoia such as instability of negative emotions and the use of less adaptive ER strategies. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and more pronounced instability of negative emotions are relevant to paranoia in patients with psychosis and should be a special focus of CBTp interventions. Future interventions designed for patients suffering from paranoia should promote coping with unstable negative emotions and replacing or reducing maladaptive emotion regulation strategies with adaptive ones.",0,797

Nanoscale 6(2","The enhancement of upconversion luminescence of lanthanide-ion doped fluoride upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is particularly important and highly required for their myriad applications in sensing, photoelectronic devices and bio-imaging. In this work, the amplification of luminescence in NaYF4:Yb/Er and NaYF4:Yb/Tm UCNPs in close proximity to the three-dimensional photonic crystal (3D PC) surface for improved near-infrared photoresponse of a carbon nanotube-based phototransistor is reported. The self-assembled opal 3D PCs with polystyrene sphere sizes of 200, 290 and 360 nm that exhibit reflection peaks of 450, 650 and 800 nm respectively were used for upconversion enhancement, and around 30 times enhancement was obtained for NaYF4:Yb/Er and NaYF4:Yb/Tm UCNPs. Time-resolved upconversion emission and 3D PC transmittance-dependent upconversion enhancement reveal that the enhanced absorption and the extraction effects, resulting from the enhanced non-resonant pump excitation field and the strong coherent scattering provided by 3D PCs respectively, are responsible for the large enhancement. As a proof-of-concept experiment, the prepared 3D PC/NaYF4:Yb/Tm UCNP coupled material layer was introduced into the carbon nanotube-based phototransistor. It is shown that the photoresponsivity of the device to near-infrared light was improved by 10 times with respect to the control device with carbon nanotubes only, which reveals the promising applications of this coupled material in photoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics and other types of phototransistors.",0,798

The process begins with the condensation of a water droplet at the base of the spore. The fusion of the droplet onto the spore creates a momentum that propels the spore forward. The use of surface tension for spore ejection offers a new paradigm to perform work at small length scales. However, this mechanism of force generation remains poorly understood. To elucidate how fungal spores make effective use of surface tension, we performed a detailed mechanical analysis of the three stages of spore ejection: the transfer of energy from the drop to the spore, the work of fracture required to release the spore from its supporting structure and the kinetic energy of the spore after ejection. High-speed video imaging of spore ejection in Auricularia auricula and Sporobolomyces yeasts revealed that drop coalescence takes place over a short distance ( approximately 5 microm) and energy transfer is completed in less than 4 mus. Based on these observations, we developed an explicit relation for the conversion of surface energy into kinetic energy during the coalescence process. The relation was validated with a simple artificial system and shown to predict the initial spore velocity accurately (predicted velocity: 1.2 m s(-1); observed velocity: 0.8 m s(-1) for A. auricula). Using calibrated microcantilevers, we also demonstrate that the work required to detach the spore from the supporting sterigma represents only a small fraction of the total energy available for spore ejection. Finally, our observations of this unique discharge mechanism reveal a surprising similarity with the mechanics of jumping in animals.",0,799

Journal of Clinical Nursing 23(11-12","AIMS AND OBJECTIVESTo describe how patients with major depression in psychiatric outpatient care use the portfolio method and whether the method helps the patients to understand their depression.BACKGROUNDMajor depressive disorder is an increasing problem in society. Learning about one's depression has been demonstrated to be important for recovery. If the goal is better understanding and management of depression, learning must proceed on the patient's own terms, based on the patient's previous understanding of their depression. Learning must be aligned with patient needs if it is to result in meaningful and useful understanding.DESIGNEach patient's portfolio consisted of a binder. Inside the binder, there was a register with predetermined flaps and questions. The patients were asked to work with the questions in the sections that built the content in the portfolio.METHODSIndividual interviews with patients (n = 5) suffering from major depression according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association 1994) were repeatedly conducted between April 2008 and August 2009 in two psychiatric outpatient clinics in western Sweden. Data were analysed using latent content analysis.RESULTSThe results showed that the portfolio was used by patients as a management strategy for processing and analysis of their situation and that a portfolio's structure affects its usability. The patients use the portfolio for reflection on and confirmation of their progress, to create structure in their situation, as a management strategy for remembering situations and providing reminders of upcoming activities.CONCLUSIONSUsing a clearly structured care portfolio can enable participation and patient learning and help patients understand their depression.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEThe portfolio method could provide a tool in psychiatric nursing that may facilitate patient understanding and increase self-efficacy.",0,802

This paper presents findings from an ethnographic study of the characteristics, patterns and sociocultural aspects of CSMT in three Peruvian cities. The study included participant observation in sex work venues and interviews with 42 sex workers and 25 key informants. We found that CSMT in Peru takes many forms (some not previously described in the country) and is practised in different places by people from various socioeconomic levels. In many cases, the practice appears linked to ideals of social mobility, migratory experiences and other economic activities. In addition, the increasing use of the Internet and mobile phones has changed patterns of sex work in Peru.

Biol. 54 6313-36) and the interaction of a bubble with a shockwave (Klaseboer et al 2007 J. Fluid Mech. 593 33-56), the present work concerns the interaction of a gas bubble with a traveling shock wave (such as from a lithotripter) in the vicinity of bio-materials such as fat, skin, muscle, cornea, cartilage, and bone. The bubble is situated in water (to represent a water-like biofluid). The bubble collapses are not spherically symmetric, but tend to feature a high speed jet. A few simulations are performed and compared with available experimental observations from Sankin and Zhong (2006 Phys. Rev. E 74 046304). The collapses of cavitation bubbles (created by laser in the experiment) near an elastic membrane when hit by a lithotripter shock wave are correctly captured by the simulation. This is followed by a more systematic study of the effects involved concerning shockwave bubble biomaterial interactions. If a subsequent rarefaction wave hits the collapsed bubble, it will re-expand to a very large size straining the bio-materials nearby before collapsing once again. It is noted that, for hard bio-material like bone, reflection of the shock wave at the bone-water interface can affect the bubble dynamics. Also the initial size of the bubble has a significant effect. Large bubbles (∼1 mm) will split into smaller bubbles, while small bubbles collapse with a high speed jet in the travel direction of the shock wave.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, multicenter case-series study. METHODS: Patients' data were entered into a computerized database for review and statistical analyses. The following parameters were assessed; age, gender, initial and final visual acuity, duration between onset and surgery, presence of lens in the eye, characteristics of injury, presence of ocular complications, and number of surgeries. RESULTS: The records of 374 eyes with OGI were enrolled. The average age of the patients was 56.8 +/- 22.1 years, and the majority of patients were men (73.5%). Compared to the overall cohort, work-related OGI was the most common, associated with significantly better final visual acuity, whereas patients with fall-down OGI showed significantly worse final visual acuity (P < 0.05). Among the types of injury, both the initial and final visual acuity were significantly worse in the rupture group than in the laceration group. Multiple liner regression analyses revealed that the final visual acuity was significantly associated with initial visual acuity, type of injury (rupture), retinal detachment, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

The Journal of biological chemistry 291(35","Cytoplasmic dynein drives the majority of minus end-directed vesicular and organelle motility in the cell. However, it remains unclear how dynein is spatially and temporally regulated given the variety of cargo that must be properly localized to maintain cellular function. Recent work has suggested that adaptor proteins provide a mechanism for cargo-specific regulation of motors. Of particular interest, studies in fungal systems have implicated Hook proteins in the regulation of microtubule motors. Here we investigate the role of mammalian Hook proteins, Hook1 and Hook3, as potential motor adaptors. We used optogenetic approaches to specifically recruit Hook proteins to organelles and observed rapid transport of peroxisomes to the perinuclear region of the cell. This rapid and efficient translocation of peroxisomes to microtubule minus ends indicates that mammalian Hook proteins activate dynein rather than kinesin motors. Biochemical studies indicate that Hook proteins interact with both dynein and dynactin, stabilizing the formation of a supramolecular complex. Complex formation requires the N-terminal domain of Hook proteins, which resembles the calponin-homology domain of end-binding (EB) proteins but cannot bind directly to microtubules. Single-molecule motility assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicate that both Hook1 and Hook3 effectively activate cytoplasmic dynein, inducing longer run lengths and higher velocities than the previously characterized dynein activator bicaudal D2 (BICD2). Together, these results suggest that dynein adaptors can differentially regulate dynein to allow for organelle-specific tuning of the motor for precise intracellular trafficking.",0,808

This study describes an integrated event detection model which combines multiple sensor stations data with network hydraulics. To date event detection modelling is likely limited to single sensor station location and dataset. Single sensor station models are detached from network hydraulics insights and as a result might be significantly exposed to false positive alarms. This work is aimed at decreasing this limitation through integrating local and spatial hydraulic data understanding into an event detection model. The spatial analysis complements the local event detection effort through discovering events with lower signatures by exploring the sensors mutual hydraulic influences. The unique contribution of this study is in incorporating hydraulic simulation information into the overall event detection process of spatially distributed sensors. The methodology is demonstrated on two example applications using base runs and sensitivity analyses.

Cognitive responses to positive affect are interesting in the context of emotion regulation and emotion disorders: positive rumination is associated to hypomania risk and bipolar disorder. There is to date no questionnaire in Swedish that captures the phenomena of cognitive response styles. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the replicability of the Responses to Positive Affect questionnaire (RPA) in a newly translated Swedish version and to test its psychometric properties. Methods: Swedish undergraduates (n = 111) completed a set of self-report questionnaires in a fixed order. Results: The hypothesized three-factor model was largely replicated in the subscales Self-focused positive rumination, Emotion-focused positive rumination and Dampening. The two positive rumination subscales were strongly associated with each other and current positive affect. The subscales showed acceptable convergent and incremental validity with concurrent measures of depression, hypomania, anxiety, repetitive negative thinking, and positive and negative affect. The model explained 25% of the variance in hypomania, but fell short in the explanation of depression. Conclusions: The Swedish version of the RPA shows satisfactory reliability and initial findings from a student sample indicate that it is a valid measure comparable with the original RPA questionnaire. Results give emphasis to the importance of further exploration of cognitive response styles in relation to psychopathology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,811

Among the 85 sources, 31 empirical studies, 17 book chapters, 32 review papers and five case studies were identified concerning parental reflective functioning.RESULTSThe concept of reflective functioning, defined as the capacity to envision the mental states of self and other, was first described in 1989 by Fonagy.

It is shown that the pyrimidines, adenine and guanine, adsorb to gold in a complex manner and that both adhesive (adenine) and cohesive (guanine) interactions contribute the apparent binding energies to the substrate surface. Adenine displays at least two adsorption sites, including a high-energy site (210 degrees C, approximately 136 kJ/mol), wherein the molecule coordinates to the gold substrate via the NH2 group in an sp3-like, strongly perturbed, nonplanar configuration. The purines, cytosine and thymine, display a less complicated adsorption/desorption behavior. The desorption energy for cytosine (160 degrees C, approximately 122 kJ/mol) is similar to those obtained for adenine and guanine, but desorption occurs from a single site of dispersed, nonaggregated cytosine. Thymine desorbs also from a single site but at a significantly lower energy (100 degrees C, approximately 104 kJ/mol).

Higher levels of rumination and reflection were associated with better working memory and immediate and delayed verbal memory (r = .36–.43, p < .01). Higher levels of rumination were also associated with greater verbal fluency, self‐awareness, and mood symptoms (r = .36–.70, p < .01). Conclusions Individuals with better memory functioning may be more likely to engage in self‐focused processing after severe TBI. Reflection without ruminative tendencies is more adaptive for mental health than reflection with rumination. Practitioner points Individuals with severe TBI report more mood symptoms than non‐injured controls but do not differ on self‐focused processing. Poorer memory function is related to lower levels of rumination and reflection. Reflection without ruminative tendencies is adaptive for mental health after severe TBI. Individuals with greater self‐awareness and ruminative tendencies are at increased risk of mental health problems following severe TBI. Limitations Rumination and reflection were assessed using a self‐report measure which assumes that people with severe TBI are able to reliably report on self‐focused processing styles. The direction of associations between self‐focused processing, self‐awareness, and mood symptoms could not be determined due to the cross‐sectional design.

Omics 22(8","Globalization and knowledge mobilization (KM) are twin challenges impacting precision medicine currently. Previous KM models have been largely limited to an implementation framework whereby knowledge is imagined as a billiard ball to be simply rolled over from the laboratory to society and from developed to developing countries. This narrow and sanitized understanding of KM and science as being detached from social forces, human values, politics, and power inequities does not help to achieve robust and responsible emergence of precision medicine, not least because tailored medicines are not simple products ready to use off-the-shelf without customization in each country, local context and society. It is time to broaden the art and science of KM by rethinking knowledge as a dynamic co-product of both technology and social systems in which science is embedded. This article presents an analysis of the four possible approaches to KM available to the precision medicine community: (1) ""knowledge implementation,"" (2) ""research collaborator capacity building,"" (3) ""collaborative entanglement"" that removes the barriers between research and practice, and extends knowledge co-creation activities beyond scientists by inviting publics, patients, and clinicians as researchers, and (4) ""knowledge ecosystem"" approach that adopts systems thinking, addressing not only technology development but also the politics of innovation, whereby power differences in scientific practice are addressed, for example, to achieve gender parity and diversity in the scientific work force. Blending of laboratory science with KM theory and practice informs robust and responsible emergence of precision medicine innovations, and helps strike the right balance between promotion and regulation of emerging technologies.",0,821

Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES 21(6","BACKGROUNDThe objective of this study was to identify the effects of weight and size characteristics of posterior segment intraocular foreign bodies (IOFBs) in open globe injuries.METHODSFifty-eight eyes of 58 patients with posterior segment IOFBs were enrolled in the study. All IOFBs were removed by pars plana vitrectomy. Factors including age, gender, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), nature of IOFBs, weight and dimensions of IOFBs, initial ocular features, timing of IOFB removal, entry site of IOFBs, interventions and complications were evaluated.RESULTSMean age of the patients was 32.7±14.2 years, and mean follow up period was 18±13.3 months. Weight, length, width and thickness of IOFBs were found negatively correlated with initial and final BCVA levels (p<0.05). Weight of IOFBs was significantly greater in eyes with initial hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and uveal prolapse (p<0.05). Width and thickness of IOFBs were significantly greater in eyes with hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage and uveal prolapse (p<0.05). Length of IOFBs was significantly longer in eyes with hyphema (p<0.05). Presence of initial or subsequent retinal detachment was associated with poor final BCVA (p<0.05). There was no association between the timing of IOFB removal and incidence of endophthalmitis.CONCLUSIONGreater weight and size of posterior segment IOFBs were associated with worse outcomes in open globe injuries. Protective eyewear has a crucial importance to avoid work-related injuries. In our study, early or late vitrectomy for an IOFB removal had no significant effect on anatomic and visual outcomes. Therefore, vitrectomy can be postponed until optimal conditions are obtained.",0,822

Journal of molecular biology 427(17","Vinculin is an abundant protein found at cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix junctions. In muscles, a longer splice isoform of vinculin, metavinculin, is also expressed. The metavinculin-specific insert is part of the C-terminal tail domain, the actin-binding site of both isoforms. Mutations in the metavinculin-specific insert are linked to heart disease such as dilated cardiomyopathies. Vinculin tail domain (VT) both binds and bundles actin filaments. Metavinculin tail domain (MVT) binds actin filaments in a similar orientation but does not bundle filaments. Recently, MVT was reported to sever actin filaments. In this work, we asked how MVT influences F-actin alone or in combination with VT. Cosedimentation and limited proteolysis experiments indicated a similar actin binding affinity and mode for both VT and MVT. In real-time total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy experiments, MVT's severing activity was negligible. Instead, we found that MVT binding caused a 2-fold reduction in F-actin's bending persistence length and increased susceptibility to breakage. Using mutagenesis and site-directed labeling with fluorescence probes, we determined that MVT alters actin interprotomer contacts and dynamics, which presumably reflect the observed changes in bending persistence length. Finally, we found that MVT decreases the density and thickness of actin filament bundles generated by VT. Altogether, our data suggest that MVT alters actin filament flexibility and tunes filament organization in the presence of VT. Both of these activities are potentially important for muscle cell function. Perhaps MVT allows the load of muscle contraction to act as a signal to reorganize actin filaments.",0,823

Animal 12(1","Although the conventional in situ ruminal degradability method is a relevant tool to describe the nutritional value of ruminant feeds, its need for rumen-fistulated animals may impose a restriction on its use when considering animal welfare issues and cost. The aim of the present work was to develop a ruminal degradability technique which avoids using surgically prepared animals. The concept was to orally dose a series of porous bags containing the test feeds at different times before slaughter, when the bags would be removed from the rumen for degradation measurement. Bags, smaller than those used in the conventional nylon bag technique, were made from woven nylon fabric, following two shape designs (rectangular flat shape, tetrahedral shape) and were fitted with one of three types of device for preventing their regurgitation. These bags were used in two experiments with individually housed non-pregnant, non-lactating sheep, as host animals for the in situ ruminal incubation of forage substrates. The bags were closed at the top edge by machine stitching and wrapped in tissue paper before oral dosing. Standard times for ruminal incubation of substrates in all of the tests were 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h before slaughter. The purpose of the first experiment was to compare the effectiveness of the three anti-regurgitation device designs, constructed from nylon cable ties ('Z-shaped', ARD1; 'double Z-shaped', ARD2; 'umbrella-shaped', ARD3), and to observe whether viable degradation curves could be generated using grass hay as the substrate. In the second experiment, three other substrates (perennial ryegrass, red clover and barley straw) were compared using flat and tetrahedral bags fitted with type ARD1 anti-regurgitation devices. Non-linear mixed-effect regression models were used to fit asymptotic exponential curves of the percentage dry matter loss of the four substrates against time of incubation in the reticulorumen, and the effect of type of anti-regurgitation device and the shape of nylon bag. All three devices were highly successful at preventing regurgitation with 93% to 100% of dosed bags being recovered in the reticulorumen at slaughter. Ruminal degradation data obtained for tested forages were in accordance with those expected from the conventional degradability technique using fistulated animals, with no significant differences in the asymptotic values of degradation curves between bag shape or anti-regurgitation device. The results of this research demonstrate the potential for using a small bag technique with intact sheep to characterise the in situ ruminal degradability of roughages.",0,824

Journal of the American Chemical Society 134(22","The activation of dioxygen is a key step in CO oxidation catalyzed by gold nanoparticles. It is known that small gold cluster anions with even-numbered atoms can molecularly chemisorb O(2) via one-electron transfer from Au(n)(-) to O(2), whereas clusters with odd-numbered atoms are inert toward O(2). Here we report spectroscopic evidence of two modes of O(2) activation by the small even-sized Au(n)(-) clusters: superoxo and peroxo chemisorption. Photoelectron spectroscopy of O(2)Au(8)(-) revealed two distinct isomers, which can be converted from one to the other depending on the reaction time. Ab initio calculations show that there are two close-lying molecular O(2)-chemisorbed isomers for O(2)Au(8)(-): the lower energy isomer involves a peroxo-type binding of O(2) onto Au(8)(-), while the superoxo chemisorption is a slightly higher energy isomer. The computed detachment transitions of the superoxo and peroxo species are in good agreement with the experimental observation. The current work shows that there is a superoxo to peroxo chemisorption transition of O(2) on gold clusters at Au(8)(-): O(2)Au(n)(-) (n = 2, 4, 6) involves superoxo binding and n = 10, 12, 14, 18 involves peroxo binding, whereas the superoxo binding re-emerges at n = 20 due to the high symmetry tetrahedral structure of Au(20), which has a very low electron affinity. Hence, the two-dimensional (2D) Au(8)(-) is the smallest anionic gold nanoparticle that prefers peroxo binding with O(2). At Au(12)(-), although both 2D and 3D isomers coexist in the cluster beam, the 3D isomer prefers the peroxo binding with O(2).",0,827

A thiol coupling of 220 ± 14 and 127 ± 33 μmol/g polymer for 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)- and cysteine-coupled silicone oil was determined, respectively. The dynamic viscosity of MPA-silicone raised significantly (p<0.000001) after oxidation with iodine to a maximum of 523-fold within 1h. During tensile studies, MPA-silicone showed both the highest results for total work of adhesion (TWA) and maximum detachment force (MDF) with a 3.8- and 3.4-fold increase, respectively, compared to the control. As far as the residence time on small intestinal mucosa is concerned, both silicone conjugates were detectable in almost the same quantities for up to 8h with 56.9 ± 3.3 and 47.8 ± 8.9% of the initially applied conjugated silicone oil. Thiolated silicone oils can be regarded superior in comparison to commonly used silicone oils due to a prolonged retention time in the small intestine as site of action. Gelling and mucoadhesive features are advantageous for antiflatulent as well as mucoprotective biomaterials.

To predict detachment, it is necessary to take the mechanical properties of the biofilm and the effect of both hydrodynamic and growth conditions into account. In this work, experiments were conducted with biofilms developed under various shear stresses and with various substrate natures. In addition, two cases were considered in order to differentiate between the effect of hydrodynamic factors and growth factors: the biofilms were directly grown under the targeted shear stress (τ) condition or they were precultivated under very low shear stress (0.01 Pa) and then exposed to high shear stress in the range of 0.1-13 Pa. An exponential and asymptotic decrease of the biofilm thickness and mass with increasing τ was observed in both cases. On contrary density, expressed as the biofilm dry mass on a known substratum divided by the average thickness increased with τ. Denitrifying biofilms always showed greater thickness and density than oxic biofilms. These results showed the presence of a compact basal layer that resisted shear stresses as high as 13 Pa whatever the culture conditions. Above this basal layer, the cohesion was lower and depended on the shear stress applied during biofilm development. The application of shear stress to the biofilms resulted in both detachment and compression, but detachment prevailed for the upper part of the biofilms and compression prevailed for the basal layers.

Previous literature has identified caregiver illness uncertainty as a predictor of PTSS, yet little is known about the mechanism by which illness uncertainty may affect PTSS. Rumination, or perseverations about the cause and consequences of an event, has been related to posttraumtic stress disorder in other populations. However, limited research of this relationship exists for pediatric cancer caregivers. Further, no studies have evaluated rumination in relation to illness uncertainty. The current study examined rumination in relation to illness uncertainty and PTSS in caregivers with children actively receiving treatment for cancer. It was hypothesized that rumination would be related to illness uncertainty and would mediate the relationship between illness uncertainty and PTSS. METHODS: Caregivers (N = 59) completed the Parent Perception of Uncertainty Scale, Ruminative Responses Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. RESULTS: illness uncertainty was identified as a significant predictor of rumination (B = 0.148, p = .015), and rumination was a significant predictor of PTSS (B = 1.83, p < .001).

Eur J Pharm Biopharm 132: 103-111.","This work describes S-preactivated N-acetylcysteine (NAC)- and glutathione (GSH)-glycol chitosan (GC) polymer conjugates engineered as potential mucoadhesive platform. Preactivated thiomers (GC-NAC-MNA, GC-GSH-MNA) were synthesized by bond formation between GC-NAC or GC-GSH and 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (MNA) used as ligand. The presence of protected thiol moieties on this new class of thiolated GC made them not subject to oxidation. The structural modifications of the resulting derivatives were confirmed by proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ((1)H NMR) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). The conjugates displayed 91.2% and 90.1% of S-preactivation for GC-NAC-MNA and GC-GSH-MNA, respectively. The polymers were tested in ex-vivo and in vitro for their mucoadhesive properties and toxicity. The results showed that the preactivation of GC-NAC and GC-GSH increased their mucoadhesive abilities compared to their thiolated precursors by 1.4-, 4.4-fold in time of adhesion evaluated using rotating cylinder method, 1.6-, 1.5-fold in total work of adhesion (TWA) and 2.0-, 1.3-fold in maximum detachment force (MDA) determined using tensile studies, respectively. Moreover, water-uptake studies showed an improved in weight indicating water-uptake strongly dependent on derivations, before erosion occurred, whereas disintegration took place for the thiolated polymers within the first hour. The S-preactivated modification did not affect the cell viability of Caco2 cells exposed to the polymers. The release of the model drug sodium naproxen from tablets prepared with a lyophilized mixture of drug and polymer was studied via dissolution apparatus revealing that the preactivation on GC-GSH and GC-NAC involves a slowdown in the drug release rate. The results shown that the novel preactivated thiolated GC-derivatives can be considered promising excipients for the development of mucoadhesive drug delivery systems.",0,842

Besides, the translation parts can introduce specific systematic extinctions of magnetic reflections. Another point is that the efficiency and stability of refinement of magnetic crystal structures, in analogy with the refinement of nuclear structures, depend on direct application of the magnetic symmetry in the structure-factor formula. Magnetic symmetry also allows diffractionally independent magnetic domains and their mutual spatial orientations to be recognized. The selection of one irreducible representation can provide extra relationships between magnetic moments which do not directly affect diffraction symmetry.

To this end, an essential prerequisite are the reliability of spectral data acquired in situ and the availability of spectral databases acquired from reference materials. A collection of polymeric samples, which are available commercially as ResinKit, was analyzed to create a reference spectral archive.

The aim of this theoretical paper is to draw attention to how psychiatrists can use their existing knowledge and skill set to inform their understanding of leadership theory and practice. In particular, the Psychodynamic Leadership Approach and Leader-Member Exchange theory are compared and contrasted to illustrate this point. The former represents a less well-known approach to leadership theory and practice whereas the latter is a widely familiar, conventional theory that is regularly taught in leadership courses. Both are underpinned by their emphasis on leader-follower relationships-and human relationships more broadly-and are intuitively appealing to psychiatrists endeavouring to understand aspects of organisational behaviour in the healthcare settings in which they work and lead. The application of these theories to assist reflection on and understanding of professional and personal leadership behaviours through leadership-oriented Balint-style groups and 360-degree appraisal is proposed.

We used ephrin-A2A5-/- mice, which are known to possess visuotopic mapping errors that are ameliorated by LI-rTMS, and assessed the impact of stimulation when mice were engaged in a visual learning task. A detachable coil was affixed to each mouse, and animals underwent 2 wk of 10-min daily training in a two-choice visual discrimination task with concurrent LI-rTMS or sham stimulation. No-task controls (+LI-rTMS/sham) were placed in the task arena without visual task training. At the end of the experiment, visuomotor tracking behavior was assessed, and corticotectal and geniculocortical pathway organization was mapped by injections of fluorescent tracers into the primary visual cortex. Consistent with previous results, LI-rTMS alone improved geniculocortical and corticotectal topography, but combining LI-rTMS with the visual learning task prevented beneficial corticotectal reorganization and had no additional effect on geniculocortical topography or visuomotor tracking performance. Unexpectedly, there was a significant increase in the total number of trials completed by task + LI-rTMS mice in the visual learning task.

The development and optimization of this analytical methodology can provide a tool that is capable of supporting conservators during the first steps of their interventions, yielding fast results and dramatically reducing the number of samples needed to identify the materials involved. Furthermore, since reflection IR spectra suffer from important spectral anomalies that complicate accurate spectral interpretation, it is important to characterize known reference materials and substrates in advance. This work aims to verify the possibility of investigating and identifying the most widely used wood finishes by means of fiber-optic (chalcogenide and metal halides) mid-infrared spectroscopy. Two historically widely employed wood finishes (beeswax, shellac) and two modern ones (a hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin and a microcrystalline wax) were investigated in an extended IR range (from 1000 to 6000 cm(-1)) with reflectance spectroscopy and with FORS. The broad spectral response of the MCT detector was exploited in order to include overtones and combination bands from the NIR spectral range in the investigation. The reflectance spectra were compared with those collected in transmission mode in order to highlight modifications to shapes and intensities, to assign absorptions, and finally to select ""marker"" bands indicating the presence of certain finishing materials, even when applied onto a substrate such as wood, which shows many absorptions in the mid-infrared region.

Biotechnology and bioengineering 103(1","The macrostructure development of biofilms grown in a lab-scale rotating biological contactor was monitored by analyzing the average opacity and the texture of gray-level images of the discs. The reactor was fed with municipal or synthetic wastewater. Experiments lasted on average 4-14 weeks. The images were obtained with a flat-bed scanner. The opacity and its standard deviation are directly extracted from the annular zone where the biofilm develops. This zone is defined by the outer edge of the disc and the waterline. The spatial gray-level dependence matrix (SGLDM) approach was used for the texture assessment. As this method requires rectangular images, a geometrical transformation had to be developed to transform the ring into a workable area. This transformation now allows quantitative image analysis on circular biofilms. As a last step, Principal Components Analysis was applied to the set of textural descriptors to reduce the number of textural parameters. Opacity and textural information allowed the non-intrusive monitoring of the growth/regrowth of the biofilms as well as biofilm loss, due to detachment, auto-digestion, or protozoan grazing. Textural description was very valuable by helping to discriminate biofilms of similar opacity characteristics but presenting different macrostructures.",0,869

Chemosphere 163: 382-391.","A micro-contamination phenomenon was reproduced and studied at lab-scale, mimicking the irrigation of a standard artificial soil with a water solution containing three Heavy Metals (HMs) at trace concentration level. To assess the dynamics of micro-pollutants accumulation and migration trough the soil, the organic matter in the soil was varied, together with sodicity of the irrigation water. Accumulation of the investigated contaminants was observed mainly in the top layer (≤1 cm) of the irrigated soil. This was attributed to the high interaction capacity of the soil compared to the low HM concentrations in the water phase. HMs transport pattern was described assuming a multi-component mechanism including: i) the interaction of HMs with the colloidal phase of the soil; ii) the slow and constant release of small molecular weight ligands detaching from the soil immobile matrix; iii) the transportation of HMs through the soil by these low molecular weight chaperon molecules. The mobility was directly related to the soil organic matter (SOM), since higher amount of SOM correspond to a higher number of chaperon molecules. In the first centimetre of the soil the metals were mostly bound to the acid labile fraction. Very low mobilization was observed with increasing sodicity in the leaching water, since such conditions were unfavourable to the colloidal mobilization of SOM. This indicated that water/soil transfer of pollutant is not only related to the contaminant concentration in the irrigation water but also to the characteristics of the aqueous solution and to the physical-chemical properties of the soil.",0,870

The cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of microbial cells impact a number of interactions and processes including aggregation, adhesion to surfaces, and stability of the cells within the aqueous environments. These cell characteristics are unique to the bacterial species and are a reflection of the large diversity of surface structures, proteins, and appendages of microorganisms. CSH and EPM of bacterial cells contribute substantially to the effectiveness of drinking water treatment to remove them, and therefore an investigation of these properties will be useful in predicting their removal through drinking water treatment processes and transport through drinking water distribution systems. EPM and CSH measurements of six microbiological pathogen or surrogate species suspended in phosphate-buffered water are reported in this work. Two strains of Vibrio cholerae were hydrophobic, while three strains of Escherichia coli were hydrophilic. Bacillus cereus was categorized as moderately hydrophobic. The strains of E. coli had the highest (most negative) EPM.

Samples of source water, effluent from T and C, and from the stagnant water in the carboy (liquid container) after bench work was completed (S2), were collected aseptically, serially diluted, and cultured on R2A agar for seven days every six weeks. SEM images of the inside surfaces of detached tubing sections were also taken. The carboy was rinsed with a 1:10 dilution of sodium hypochlorite after six months. Means of log transformed CFU values obtained in triplicate were paired by T and C lines across months for comparison by paired Student's t-tests.RESULTSAn increase in effluent and carboy bacterial counts were noted after six months, but decreased after bleach rinse of the carboy. No significant difference (p > 0.25) between T and C lines were observed; similarly, T and carboy were not significantly different (p > 0.30). SEM images showed biofilm attachment on the inside surface of C after two months, but not on T. Organisms identified in the effluent reflected those in the source carboy.CONCLUSIONSNo biofilm attachment was detected on the N-halamine test line after 12 months, indicating its antimicrobial properties were retained. Further evaluation is recommended to determine the optimal recharge interval for N-halamine DUWL tubing when ultrapure source water is used.",0,872

Consequently, grounded knowledge, which forms the basis of the practical change, is developed. 'Social rehabilitation' was the field of clinical practice which needed enhancement as the literature lacked nurse-led social rehabilitation programmes in the neurology field.DESIGNThis was a cyclic action research project.METHODSThe project took place in a highly specialised hospital in Spain and aimed to promote social life of neurological patients and relatives through the planning, implementation and evaluation of a nurse-led social rehabilitation programme based on individual needs. In this project, which lasted 30 months, multiple triangulation of sources and methods was applied. Thirty-seven nurses participated and 22 and 18 patients and their relatives constituted a baseline and an intervention group, respectively.RESULTSSeveral issues were carefully treated in this action research project to develop practical and theoretical knowledge about social rehabilitation: the validity and reliability of the project, the work organisation of the wards, the nurses' attitudes towards new care, the researcher-participant relationship and the controversial role of professionals in social rehabilitation.CONCLUSIONThe nurses' emancipation in the process of practice change led to practical and theoretical assimilation of social rehabilitation. Intensive work on practitioners' attitudes and the provision of empirical evidence were key interventions to foster controversial roles and enhance services.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEDetails about the process of change of nursing practice in response to clients' needs have been provided.

Further, previous studies only tested the associations between composite scores of inferences, from the hopelessness model, and rumination (incl. brooding and reflection), from the response style theory. Thus, a 3-wave study using self-report instruments with 519 adolescents was conducted (mean ageWave 1 = 16.09 years; SD = 0.70; 62.7% female; 72.8% European American, 14.7% African-American, 5.4% Latino, 4.4% mixed race/ethnicity, 1.4% Asian/Pacific Islander, 0.8% Native American, and 0.6% identified as 'other'). The school serves predominantly working to middle class families and almost one third of the students were eligible for free or reduced lunch programs. AMOS and RMediation were used to calculate and compare five different theory-driven models. The findings of the study provide support for an integrated model in which both brooding and reflection are influenced by individual inferences and interact with individual inferences while affecting depressive symptoms. In addition, reflection plays an unexpectedly important role in this integrated model. Age and cognitive development are discussed as possible explanations for this finding.

Biokhimiia 78(3","We were the first to show that MbO2 deoxygenation in the cell occurs only upon interaction of myoglobin with mitochondrial membrane, which must be accompanied by changes in the heme cavity conformation of the protein and its affinity for the ligand. Under aerobic conditions, some changes in the equilibrium O2 dissociation constant (Kdis) can be detected by changes of the rate of MbO2 autooxidation, i.e. spontaneous turning it into metMb (kox), as far as a direct correlation between Kdis and kox is experimentally shown. In this work, we studied the effect on MbO2 autooxidation rate of phospholipid liposomes from neutral soybean phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and from negatively charged 1-palmitoyl-2-oleylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) at various phospholipid/MbO2 ratios from 25 : 1 to 100 : 1, and also the effect of rat liver mitochondria at concentration of 1 and 2 mg/ml mitochondrial protein (at 22 and 37°C). In all cases, kox was found to increase due to interaction of the protein with phospholipid membranes. The effect of negatively charged liposomes from POPG on kox is significantly greater than that of neutral lecithin liposomes. At the POPG/MbO2 molar ratio of 25 : 1, MbO2 autooxidation rate is almost 25-fold increased compared to the control, whereas in the presence of 50-fold molar excess of lecithin, kox is only ~10 times higher (10 mM buffer, pH 7.2, 22°C). With the same phospholipid/MbO2 ratio of 100 : 1, kox is 7 times higher for the POPG than for lecithin liposomes. In the presence of mitochondria inhibited by antimycin A, kox grows proportionally to their concentration (about 10-fold per 1 mg/ml of mitochondrial protein), and practically does not change after adding superoxide dismutase in the reaction mixture. The kox value decreases markedly at high ionic strength, thus suggesting an important role of coulombic electrostatics in the myoglobin-mitochondrial interaction. The increase in the autooxidation rate of MbO2 (and hence its Kdis) due to the interaction with phospholipid membranes points to decreasing affinity of myoglobin for oxygen, which facilitates O2 detachment from MbO2 at physiological p02 values.",0,876

To better understand and ideally prevent the onset of post‐pubertal mental disorders, a clinical staging model has been proposed that provides a longitudinal perspective of illness development. This heuristic model takes account of the differential effects of both genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as markers relevant to the stage of illness, course or prognosis. The aim of the Transitions Study is to test empirically the assumptions that underpin the clinical staging model. Additionally, it will permit investigation of a range of psychological, social and genetic markers in terms of their capacity to define current clinical stage or predict transition from less severe or enduring to more severe and persistent stages of mental disorder. Method: This paper describes the study methodology, which involves a longitudinal cohort design implemented within four headspace youth mental health services in Australia. Participants are young people aged 12–25 years who have sought help at headspace and consented to complete a comprehensive assessment of clinical state and psychosocial risk factors. A total of 802 young people (66% female) completed baseline assessments. Annual follow‐up assessments have commenced. Conclusions: The results of this study may have implications for the way mental disorders are diagnosed and treated, and progress our understanding of the pathophysiologies of complex mental disorders by identifying genetic or psychosocial markers of illness stage or progression.

Journal of molecular biology 411(1","We have used EPR spectroscopy and computational modeling of nucleotide-analog spin probes to investigate conformational changes at the nucleotide site of myosin V. We find that, in the absence of actin, the mobility of a spin-labeled diphosphate analog [spin-labeled ADP (SLADP)] bound at the active site is strongly hindered, suggesting a closed nucleotide pocket. The mobility of the analog increases when the MV·SLADP complex (MV=myosin V) binds to actin, implying an opening of the active site in the A·MV·SLADP complex (A=actin). The probe mobilities are similar to those seen with myosin II, despite the fact that myosin V has dramatically altered kinetics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to understand the EPR spectra in terms of the X-ray database. The X-ray structure of MV·ADP·BeFx shows a closed nucleotide site and has been proposed to be the detached state. The MV·ADP structure shows an open nucleotide site and has been proposed to be the A·MV·ADP state at the end of the working powerstroke. MD simulation of SLADP docked in the closed conformation gave a probe mobility comparable to that seen in the EPR spectrum of the MV·SLADP complex. The simulation of the open conformation gave a probe mobility that was 35-40° greater than that observed experimentally for the A·MV·SLADP state. Thus, EPR, X-ray diffraction, and computational analysis support the closed conformation as a myosin V state that is detached from actin. The MD results indicate that the MV·ADP crystal structure, which may correspond to the strained actin-bound post-powerstroke conformation resulting from head-head interaction in the dimeric processive motor, is superopened.",0,881

These species may play an important role in ozone-driven inorganic aerosol formation; however their chemical properties remain largely unknown. This is the issue addressed in this work using negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) and ab initio modeling. The NIPE spectra reveal that all of the three anionic species are characterized by high adiabatic detachment energies (ADEs) - 4.62 ± 0.10, 4.52 ± 0.10, and 4.60 ± 0.10 eV for ISO3-, IS2O3-, and IS2O4-, respectively. Vibrational progressions with frequencies assigned to the S-O symmetric stretching modes are discernable in the ground state transition features. Density functional theory calculations show the presence of several low-lying isomers involving different bonding scenarios. Further analysis based on high level CCSD(T) calculations reveal that the lowest energy structures are characterized by the formation of I-S and S-S bonds and can be structurally viewed as SO3 linked with I, IS, and ISO for ISO3-, IS2O3-, and IS2O4-, respectively. The calculated ADEs and vertical detachment energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, further supporting the identified minimum energy structures.

Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.",0,888

The present work proposes a simple, model-independent method to evaluate the effect of reflection directly from measured pulsatile pressure (P) and flow (Q). Because characteristic impedance (Z(0)) is Z(in) in the absence of reflection, the P with reflection theoretically removed can be calculated from Q x Z(0). Applying this insight to an illustrative case indicates that reflection has the least effect on P and SW at normal pressure but a greater effect with vasodilation and vasoconstriction.

Anim Sci J 89(12","Absorption of ammonia from the rumen of cattle decreases nitrogen availability for fermentational protein synthesis, leading to increased competition of cattle with humans for protein and enhancing the release of toxic nitrogenous compounds into the environment. Given that differences in feeding and breeding might induce differences in ruminal ammonia transport, we compared electrophysiological, histological, and molecular biological characteristics of ruminal epithelia of Bos indicus crossbreds (Sahiwal-Mix, SWM) with those of Bos taurus (Holstein-Friesian, HF). As in HF, the stratified cornified epithelium of SWM expressed claudin 1 and 4. Measurements of ammonia flux (HF) and serosal pH (both breeds) suggested that at a mucosal pH of 6.4, net transport primarily occurred as NH4 (+) . As shown previously for HF, NH4 (+) induced a concentration-dependent rise in short circuit current (Isc ) in SWM that could be further stimulated by the TRP channel agonist menthol. Relative mRNA expression levels for TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPM6, and TRPM7 were significantly lower in SWM than in HF, with TRPA1 expression near the limit of detection. We conclude that uptake of ammonia from the rumen of both breeds occurs electrogenically as NH4 (+) with functional and molecular biological evidence pointing towards involvement of TRPV3 and TRPV4.",0,891

Applied microbiology and biotechnology 100(22","Understanding the nature of mucus-microbe interactions will provide important information that can help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying probiotic adhesion. This study focused on the adhesive properties of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris IBB477 strain, previously shown to persist in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free rats. The shear flow-induced detachment of L. lactis cells was investigated under laminar flow conditions. Such a dynamic approach demonstrated increased adhesion to bare and mucin-coated polystyrene for IBB477, compared to that observed for the MG1820 control strain. To identify potential genetic determinants giving adhesive properties to IBB477, the improved high-quality draft genome sequence comprising chromosome and five plasmids was obtained and analysed. The number of putative adhesion proteins was determined on the basis of surface/extracellular localisation and/or the presence of adhesion domains. To identify proteins essential for the IBB477 specific adhesion property, nine deletion mutants in chromosomal genes have been constructed and analysed using adhesion tests on bare polystyrene as well as mucin-, fibronectin- or collagen IV-coated polystyrene plates in comparison to the wild-type strain. These experiments demonstrated that gene AJ89_07570 encoding a protein containing DUF285, MucBP and four Big_3 domains is involved in adhesion to bare and mucin-coated polystyrene. To summarise, in the present work, we characterised the adhesion of IBB477 under laminar flow conditions; identified the putative adherence factors present in IBB477, which is the first L. lactis strain exhibiting adhesive and mucoadhesive properties to be sequenced and demonstrated that one of the proteins containing adhesion domains contributes to adhesion.",0,892

BACKGROUND: Family involvement in the care of patients with chronic illness is essential to provide a backbone of support for them. However, little is known about how female spousal caregivers are confronted with challenges while taking care of their husbands with severe mental illness. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative study. METHODS: Fourteen female spousal caregivers of people with severe mental illness (defined here as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders and bipolar affective disorders) were recruited using purposive sampling and were interviewed using a semistructured in-depth interview method. Data were analysed by conventional content analysis until data saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Care of a husband with severe mental illness had a disruptive influence on the emotional relationships of the family and resulted in emotional detachment over time. Despite the caregivers' struggle to protect their families, the lack of supportive resources caused emotional exhaustion. Caregiving tasks interfering with their many other responsibilities, along with being a reference for family matters, led to loss of self. Consequently, they experienced psychological distress because of the transition to a caregiver role without any supportive resources. CONCLUSION: Constant caring, without supportive resources, forced them to do various roles and manage other issues within the family. Being unprepared for a caregiving role led to the psychological distress of female spousal caregivers. Therefore, adequate information, education and supportive resources must be provided for spouses to facilitate their transition to caregiving roles. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is necessary to pay close attention to the spousal caregivers' own mental health problems while they care for their mentally ill husbands. Mental health professionals should adopt a new approach to the prioritisation and planning of policies that support both family caregivers and patients.",0,894

Cell 152(1-2","Many cellular processes require large forces that are generated collectively by multiple cytoskeletal motor proteins. Understanding how motors generate force as a team is therefore fundamentally important but is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate optical trapping at single-molecule resolution inside cells to quantify force generation by motor teams driving single phagosomes. In remarkable paradox, strong kinesins fail to work collectively, whereas weak and detachment-prone dyneins team up to generate large forces that tune linearly in strength and persistence with dynein number. Based on experimental evidence, we propose that leading dyneins in a load-carrying team take short steps, whereas trailing dyneins take larger steps. Dyneins in such a team bunch close together and therefore share load better to overcome low/intermediate loads. Up against higher load, dyneins ""catch bond"" tenaciously to the microtubule, but kinesins detach rapidly. Dynein therefore appears uniquely adapted to work in large teams, which may explain how this motor executes bewilderingly diverse cellular processes.",0,895

In the present work, the effect of lead (Pb), Arsenic (As), and Cadmium (Cd) in primary cultures of Sertoli cells was analyzed by measuring the expression of the genes Cldn11, Ocln, and Gja1 that participate in the tight and gap junctions, which are responsible for maintaining the blood-testis barrier. Sertoli cells were isolated from the testes of Wistar rats. Sertoli cell cultures were exposed separately and at the same concentrations of three heavy metals for 48 h. Subsequently, gene expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the morphological analysis of the cultures, after 24 h, the cultures exposed to Cd showed greatest detachment of the monolayer, followed by those exposed to As and Pb. As for gene expression patterns, As induced a decrease in the expression of the Cldn11 gene at 24 and 48 h (p < 0.01) and in that of Ocln at 24 (p < 0.001) and 48 h (p < 0.01), whereas Cd induced overexpression of the Gja1 gene from day 1 of exposure (p < 0.001) and subexpression of the Ocln gene (p < 0.05) at 24 h. Because each of these three metals generated different expression patterns in the three genes, we can postulate that the mechanisms of damage that they induce are different; therefore, the effect that they exert on the Sertoli cell occurs through different pathways, generating changes in structural proteins, altering Sertoli cell morphology, and compromising its function in the regulation of the spermatogenesis process.",0,899

Since 2000, the restoration based on the biological cleaning of noble medieval frescoes, has been successfully utilized in this site. METHODS AND RESULTS: The novelty of this study is the two-steps biocleaning process using Pseudomonas stutzeri A29 viable cells, previously applied for recovering other valuable frescoes. In this case, after the fresco detachment from the asbestos-cement support (eternity), both the animal glue and the residues of calcium caseinate were biologically removed respectively from the front and from the back of the fresco in 3 h as indicated by GC-MS and PY/GC-MS analyses. The data obtained during the monitoring of the biorestoration process confirmed that the adopted procedure does not leave residual cells on the fresco surfaces as showed by plate count method, ATP determination and also SEM observation. In addition, to avoid the risk of condensation phenomena after the relocation of the restored fresco sections onto the original walls, the use of a new support has been set up together with the design of a control system that allows a continuous monitoring of environmental parameters for prevention and conservation purposes. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale biorestoration work clearly shows and confirms that this biotechnology is highly efficient, safe, noninvasive, risk-free and very competitive compared to the traditional cleaning methods, offering an unusual 'resurrection' of the degraded artworks also in very complicated and delicate conditions such as the Triumph of Death fresco, defined for its dimension and artistic importance the 'Pisa's Sistina frescoes'.

J Chem Phys 149(23","Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy and microscopy have been used in studying the structure and dynamics of a wide range of chemical and biological systems. However, the spatial resolution of CARS microscopy is still limited by the diffraction barrier, and hence a suitable scheme to selectively switch off the CARS imaging signal is essential for super-resolution CARS microscopy. Here, we present theoretical descriptions about three different ways to selectively suppress the pump-Stokes-pump two-beam CARS signal by employing three-beam double stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) schemes. Using a semiclassical theory for the interaction of radiation with the Raman-active molecule, we obtain coupled differential equations for the intensities of the pump, Stokes, depletion, and the generated CARS signal fields. We find approximate solutions of these coupled differential equations. They are then used to show that the pump-Stokes-pump CARS signal can be selectively suppressed by increasing the added depletion beam intensity, when the three injected beam frequencies are tuned in such a way that they can induce two SRS processes simultaneously. To show that these switching-off methods can be used to develop super-resolution CARS imaging techniques, we numerically calculate the full-width-at-half-maximum of the CARS imaging point spread function assuming that the spatial profiles of the pump and Stokes beams are Gaussian functions and that the spatial profile of the depletion beam is doughnut-shaped. We anticipate that the proposed selective CARS suppression schemes will be of use in developing super-resolution, label-free CARS microscopy.",0,902

A questionnaire survey was used with a total sample of senior clinicians in the 66 neonatal units with one or more qualified NNPs. The main outcome measures were type and frequency of response, and similar data from NNPs were used to make comparisons. Data were returned from 57 of the 66 clinicians contacted (86%). NNP clinical practice as perceived by them was largely similar to that recorded by NNPs, though the clinicians expected more NNP involvement in some procedures (inserting central venous lines, umbilical arterial catheters, chest drains and peripheral arterial cannulae) than was actually found. Perceptions of the NNP role were similar, though the clinicians were significantly less likely to see taking a case-load, conducting a ward round, accepting outside referrals and taking charge of emergency transfers as integral elements. Reflections on the utilization of NNPs in neonatal care and the impact on junior medical staff education referred to NNPs filling gaps, a reduction in the intensity of work, improvements in training and in the quality of care.CONCLUSIONThe introduction of NNPs is seen positively from the perspective of clinicians working alongside them in neonatal care.

However, simplification of the procedures for analyzing samples with complex compositions and residual matrix effects is still needed. In this work, the effect of an inorganic (CaCl2) and an organic (tetraalkylphosphonium chloride) matrix on metals quantification by TXRF was investigated for liquid samples. The samples were spiked with up to 20 metals at concentrations ranging from 3 to 50 mg L-1 per element, including elements with spectral peaks near the peaks of the matrix elements or near the Raleigh and Compton scattering peaks of the X-ray source (molybdenum anode). The recovery rate (RR) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were calculated to express the accuracy and the precision of the measured element concentrations. In samples with no matrix effects, good RRs are obtained regardless of the internal standard selected. However, in samples with moderate matrix content, the use of an optimum internal standard (OIS) at a concentration close to that of the analyte significantly improved the quantitative analysis. In samples with high concentrations of inorganic ions, using a Triton X-100 aqueous solution to dilute the sample during the internal standardization resulted in better RRs and lower RSDs compared to using only water. In samples with a high concentration of organic material, pure ethanol gave slightly better results than when a Triton X-100-ethanol solution was used for dilution. Compared to previous methods reported in the literature, the new sample-preparation method gave better accuracy, precision, and sensitivity for the elements tested. Sample dilution with an OIS and the surfactant Triton X-100 (inorganic media) or ethanol (organic media) is recommended for fast routine elemental determination in matrix containing samples, as it does not require special equipment, experimentally derived case-dependent mathematical corrections, or physicochemical removal of interfering elements.",0,904

We propose that certain cognitive processes characteristic of the AN temperament may help explain previous findings in AN suggesting difficulty updating previously learned associations and learning from feedback. Specifically, we hypothesize that engagement in repetitive negative thinking (RNT), including worry and rumination, could interfere with corrective learning that is critical to the success of behavioral treatments. In doing so, we draw from existing work in anxiety and mood disorders linking RNT to the maintenance of symptoms and poorer response to cognitive‐behavioral treatments. Next, we outline hypothesized mechanisms through which engagement in RNT before, during, and after exposure to aversive stimuli could interfere with learning in AN. We then provide recommendations for how these hypothesized associations could be tested in future research. Although prior work has suggested that RNT processes are common among individuals with AN, this work has been primarily descriptive in nature. We propose that extending this work through direct examination of the impact of active engagement in RNT on corrective learning could aid in identifying AN maintenance processes that could be explicitly targeted in treatment.

The UK’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme is part of the National Health Service (NHS) designed to provide a stepped care approach to treating people with anxiety and depressive disorders. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is widely used, with computerised and internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT and iCBT, respectively) being a suitable IAPT approved treatment alternative for step 2, low- intensity treatment. iCBT has accumulated a large empirical base for treating depression and anxiety disorders. However, the cost-effectiveness and impact of these interventions in the longer-term is not routinely assessed by IAPT services. The current study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders in IAPT. Methods: The study is a parallel-groups, randomised controlled trial examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT interventions for depression and anxiety disorders, against a waitlist control group. The iCBT treatments are of 8 weeks duration and will be supported by regular post-session feedback by Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, during, and at the end of the 8-week treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-up. A diagnostic interview will be employed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Participants in the waitlist control group will complete measures at baseline and week 8, at which point they will receive access to the treatment. All adult users of the Berkshire NHS Trust IAPT Talking Therapies Step 2 services will be approached to participate and measured against set eligibility criteria. Primary outcome measures will assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Secondary outcome measures will allow for the evaluation of long-term outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Analysis will be conducted on a per protocol and intention-to-treat basis.

The post-irradiation darkening of the film was investigated, and the relative response was found to be dose dependent with higher doses stabilizing earlier than lower doses. After 13 h all dose levels had stabilized to within 1% of their value at 24 h. Uniformity of irradiated EBT2 films was within 0.8% and 1.2% (2SD of signal), in reflection and transmission modes, respectively. The light scattering effect, arising from the structure and thickness of EBT2, was found to give rise to an apparent scanner non-uniformity of up to 5.5% in signal. In reflection mode, differences of up to 1.2% were found between the signal obtained from a small film fragment (5 x 5 cm(2)) and the signal obtained from the same fragment bordered by extra film. Further work is needed to determine the origin of this effect, as there will be implications for reflection dosimetry of intensity modulated fields; reflection mode cannot yet be regarded as a viable alternative to transmission mode.

Similar to nonsubtracted digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images, radiopaque platinum stent markers showed excellent visibility in ACT as well. The stent struts themselves, hardly visible in nonsubtracted DSA, were visible in MPRs and MIPs of ACT in all of the patients. In aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter, accurate stent assessment at the level of the coils was limited due to beam hardening artifacts. Postprocedural ACT in all of the patients did not reveal any evidence of procedure-related intracranial hemorrhage.CONCLUSIONACT provides cross-sectional, 3D visualization of endovascular stents otherwise hardly visible with plain fluoroscopy. ACT enables us to accurately determine stent position, which may be helpful in complex stent-assisted aneurysm coiling procedures. However, in aneurysms larger than 10 mm in diameter, beam hardening artifacts caused by the endoaneurysmal coil package impair visibility of the stent. Further data are necessary to evaluate the usefulness of ACT in stent-assisted aneurysm coiling.",0,912

European Psychiatry 33: 1-8.","Background: Response styles theory of depression postulates that rumination is a central factor in occurrence, severity and maintaining of depression. High neuroticism has been associated with tendency to ruminate. We investigated associations of response styles and neuroticism with severity and chronicity of depression in a primary care cohort study. Methods: In the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study, a stratified random sample of 1119 adult patients was screened for depression using the Prime-MD. Depressive and comorbid psychiatric disorders were diagnosed using SCID-I/P and SCID-II interviews. Of the 137 patients with depressive disorders, 82% completed the prospective five-year follow-up with a graphic life chart enabling evaluation of the longitudinal course of episodes. Neuroticism was measured with the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI-Q). Response styles were investigated at five years using the Response Styles Questionnaire (RSQ-43). Results: At five years, rumination correlated significantly with scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (r = 0.54), Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.61), Beck Anxiety Inventory (r = 0.50), Beck Hopelessness Scale (r = 0.51) and Neuroticism (r = 0.58). Rumination correlated also with proportion of follow-up time spent depressed (r = 0.38). In multivariate regression, high rumination was significantly predicted by current depressive symptoms and neuroticism, but not by anxiety symptoms or preceding duration of depressive episodes. Conclusions: Among primary care patients with depression, rumination correlated with current severity of depressive symptoms, but the association with preceding episode duration remained uncertain. The association between neuroticism and rumination was strong. The findings are consistent with rumination as a state-related phenomenon, which is also strongly intertwined with traits predisposing to depression.

International Journal of Transgenderism 19(2","Background: Adolescents, by their very nature and need for maturity, struggle with issues of the self and identity, while challenging the very systems that are there to support them. However, gender diverse adolescents may become detached and overwhelmed as a trans identity solidifies during this time. Bullies, blades and barricades describes the challenges, hardship and dispossession that some gender diverse adolescents face from interpersonal and intrapersonal conflicts, societal pressure and hostility. Method: This paper utilizes the current research on safety and risks affecting trans youth, the authors clinical experience of trans and gender diverse adolescents, and recommendations in the literature for professional care and support of gender diverse adolescents to identify the various ways gender diverse adolescents are negatively affected by their experiences. Results: Bullying is not limited to school or peer environments and may be present in adolescents' homes, in local communities, in professional services or from sources of information such as the media. The physical dangers gender diverse adolescents face may arise from victimization, violence or rejection, or self-harming behaviors due to negative beliefs, fear or frustration. Barriers preventing disclosure and expression of gender and/or identity may stem from negative experiences, rejection, pubertal changes, imposed limitations, dependence upon school, home or legal environments, or other spheres of influence. Discussion: Affirmative approaches, individual focus, recognition of family dynamics, inclusion of significant others, advocacy in school and local community environments as well as professional training are the most commonly recommended interventions. This paper provides an inclusive review of the myriad of challenges confronting gender diverse adolescents including often unrecognized forms of pressure, oppression and restrictions. This paper aims to support clinicians by contextualizing the adversity that gender diverse adolescents face and offers strategies for engagement and intervention.

Section A, Foundations of crystallography 67: 63-67.","A new type of direct methods (DM) called Patterson-function DM are presented that directly explore the Patterson instead of the modulus function. Since they work with the experimental intensities, they are particularly well suited for handling powder diffraction data. These methods are based on the maximization of the sum function S(P) ∝ ∑H(I(H)-<I>)G(-H)(Φ) in terms of the Φ phases of the structure factors. The quantity accessible from the experiment is I(H), the equidistributed multiplet intensity of reflection H, and <I> is the average intensity taken over all non-systematically absent reflections. G(-H)(Φ) is the calculated structure-factor amplitude of the squared structure that includes the positivity and the atomicity of the density function in its definition. The S(P) sum function can be optimized with the Patterson-function tangent formula (TF) using a variant of the S-FFT algorithm [Rius et al. (2007), Acta Cryst. A63, 131-134]. It is important that overlapped reflections also participate in the phase refinement, so that not only the resolved reflections but the whole pattern contribute decisively to the refinement. The increase in effective data resolution minimizes Fourier series termination effects and improves the accuracy of G(Φ). The Patterson-function TF has been applied to synchrotron powder data of various organic compounds. In all cases the molecules were easily identified in the respective Fourier maps. By way of illustration the method is applied to synchrotron powder data of a dimer formed by 30 symmetry-independent non-H atoms. Since single-crystal data may be regarded as overlap-free powder data, it is clear that Patterson-function DM can cope with powder and single-crystal data.",0,916

Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP 19(47","We performed femtosecond transient absorption (TA) experiments to monitor the solvation dynamics of charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) electrons originating from UV photoexcitation of ammoniated iodide in close proximity to the counterions. Solutions of KI were prepared in liquid ammonia and TA experiments were carried out at different temperatures and densities, along the liquid-gas coexistence curve of the fluid. The results complement previous femtosecond TA work by P. Vöhringer's group in neat ammonia via multiphoton ionization. The dynamics of CTTS-detached electrons in ammonia was found to be strongly affected by ion pairing. Geminate recombination time constants as well as escape probabilities were determined from the measured temporal profiles and analysed as a function of the medium density. A fast unresolved (τ < 250 fs) increase of absorption related to the creation/thermalization of solvated electron species was followed by two decay components: one with a characteristic time around 10 ps, and a slower one that remains active for hundreds of picoseconds. While the first process is attributed to an early recombination of (I, e-) pairs, the second decay and its asymptote reflects the effect of the K+ counterion on the geminate recombination dynamics, rate and yield. The cation basically acts as an electron anchor that restricts the ejection distance, leading to solvent-separated counterion-electron species. The formation of (K+, NH3, e-) pairs close to the parent iodine atom brings the electron escape probability to very low values. Transient spectra of the electron species have also been estimated as a function of time by probing the temporal profiles at different wavelengths.",0,917

Physics in medicine and biology 61(16","Ultraviolet (UVR) phototherapy is widely used to treat an array of skin conditions, including psoriasis, eczema and vitiligo. For such interventions, a quantified dose is vital if the treatment is to be both biologically effective and to avoid the detrimental effects of over-dosing. As dose is absorbed at surface level, the orientation of patient site with respect to the UVR lamps modulates effective dose. Previous investigations have modelled this behaviour, and examined the impact of shaped anodized aluminium reflectors typically placed around lamps in phototherapy cabins. These mirrors are effective but tend to yield complex patterns of reflection around the cabin which can result in substantial dose inhomogeneity. There has been some speculation over whether using the reflective property of parabolic mirrors might improve dose delivery or homogeneity through the treatment cabin. In this work, the effects of parabolic mirrors are simulated and compared with standard shaped mirrors. Simulation results strongly suggest that parabolic reflectors reduce total irradiance relative to standard shaped reflectors, and have a negligible impact on dose homogeneity.",0,920

In risk assessment-oriented ecotoxicology, defining the scope of application of additivity models has received utmost attention in the last 20 years, since they potentially allow one to predict the effect of any chemical mixture relying on individual chemical information only. The gold standard for additivity in ecotoxicology has demonstrated to be Loewe additivity which originated the so-called Concentration Addition (CA) additivity model. In pharmacology, the search for interactions or deviations from additivity (synergism and antagonism) has similarly captured the attention of researchers over the last 20 years and has resulted in the definition and application of the Combination Index (CI) Theorem. CI is based on Loewe additivity, but focused on the identification and quantification of synergism and antagonism. Despite additive models demonstrating a surprisingly good predictive power in chemical mixture risk assessment, concerns still exist due to the occurrence of unpredictable synergism or antagonism in certain experimental situations. In the present work, we summarize the parallel history of development of CA, IA, and CI models. We also summarize the applicability of these concepts in ecotoxicology and how their information may be integrated, as well as the possibility of prediction of synergism. Inside the box, the main question remaining is whether it is worthy to consider departures from additivity in mixture risk assessment and how to predict interactions among certain mixture components. Outside the box, the main question is whether the results observed under the experimental constraints imposed by fractional approaches are a de fide reflection of what it would be expected from chemical mixtures in real world circumstances.",0,922

Cultures (5 ml) of microporous Cytodex 3 and macroporous CultiSpher-S carriers were performed in vented conical tubes and subsequently scaled-up (20 ml) to shake-flasks, testing combinations of different culture conditions (cell concentration, microcarrier concentration, rocking methodology, rocking speed, and initial culture volume). Culture performance was evaluated by considering the mAb production and cell growth at the phases of initial adhesion and proliferation. The best culture performances were obtained with Cytodex 3, regarding cell proliferation (average 1.85 ± 0.11 × 10(6) cells/ml against 0.60 ± 0.08 × 10(6) cells/ ml for CultiSpher-S), mAb production (2.04 ± 0.41 μg/ml against 0.99 ± 0.35 μg/ml for CultiSpher-S), and culture longevity (30 days against 10-15 days for CultiSpher-S), probably due to the collagen-coated dextran matrix that potentiates adhesion and prevents detachment. The culture conditions of greater influence were rocking mechanism (Cytodex 3, pulse followed by continuous) and initial cell concentration (CultiSpher-S, 4 × 10(5) cells/ml). Microcarriers proved to be a viable and favorable alternative to standard adherent and suspended cultures for mAb production by CHO-K1 cells, with simple operation, easy scale-up, and significantly higher levels of mAb production.

Fifty eyes affected by one of the following diseases: rhegmatogenous or tractional retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, full-thickness macular hole, vitreous hemorrhage, or dropped lens. The 50 eyes were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group A (25 eyes) underwent 25-gauge PPV with 3DM, and group B (25 eyes) underwent 25-gauge PPV with TM. The main outcome measures were the duration of the operation, intraoperative complications, and surgeon and observer satisfaction. A questionnaire was used to assess surgeon satisfaction according to the following parameters: comfort, visibility, image quality, depth perception, simplicity of use, maneuverability, and teaching. A questionnaire to assess observer satisfaction was completed by 20 observers (surgical residents or ophthalmic surgeons). RESULTS: The degree of satisfaction was higher using 3DM for both surgeons and observers (P < 0.001). The average duration of the operation did not differ significantly between the two methods. No major complications occurred for either method. CONCLUSIONS: PPV with 3DM is more comfortable for the surgeon and poses no substantially greater risk of complications for the patient.

Many modifications to Green and colleagues' original technique have been suggested, including the use of a fibrin matrix. However, the properties of the cultured cells must be assessed using suitable criteria before a modified method of culture for therapeutic purposes is transferred to clinical use, because changes in culture conditions may reduce keratinocyte lifespan and result in the loss of the transplanted epithelium.METHODSTo evaluate the performances of human keratinocytes grown on a fibrin matrix, we assay for their colony-forming ability, their growth potential and their ability to generate an epidermis when grafted onto athymic mice. The results of these experiments allowed us to compare side by side the performance for third degree burn treatment of autologous cultured epithelium grafts grown according to Rheinwald and Green on fibrin matrices with that of grafts grown directly on plastic surfaces.RESULTSWe found that human keratinocytes cultured on a fibrin matrix had the same growth capacity and transplantability as those cultured on plastic surfaces and that the presence of a fibrin matrix greatly facilitated the preparation, handling, and surgical transplantation of the grafts, which did not need to be detached enzymatically. The rate of take of grafts grown on fibrin matrices was high, and was similar to that of conventionally cultured grafts. The grafted autologous cells are capable of generating a normal epidermis for many years and favor the regeneration of a superficial dermis.CONCLUSIONWe have demonstrated that: 1) fibrin matrices have considerable advantages over plastic for the culture of skin cells for grafting and that it is now possible to generate and transplant enough cultured epithelium from a small skin biopsy to restore completely the epidermis of an adult human in 16 days; and 2) the generated epidermis self-renews itself for years.

Physical biology 5(4","Molecular motors often work collectively inside the cell. While the properties of individual motors have been extensively studied over the last decade, much less is known on how motors coordinate their action when working in ensembles. The motor collective behaviour in conditions where they contact each other, as in intracellular transport, may strongly depend on their mutual interactions. In particular, mutual interactions may result in motor clustering without the need of additional proteins. Here we study the interactions between kinesin-1 molecules by analysing their attachment/detachment kinetics on microtubules in the absence of motor motion. Our in vitro experiments show that kinesins-1 remain longer attached to the microtubule in the presence of neighbouring motors, resulting in the formation of motor clusters. Numerical simulations of the motor attachment/detachment dynamics show that the presence of attractive interactions between motors quantitatively accounts for the experimental observations. From the comparison of the numerical results and the experimental data we estimate the interaction energy between kinesin-1 molecules to be 1.6 +/- 0.5K(B)T. The existence of attractive interactions between kinesins-1 provides a new insight into the coordination mechanism between motor proteins and may be crucial to understand the large scale traffic in cells.",0,931

A total of 1,046 employed subjects participated in this cross-sectional design study. To examine the hypotheses, a structural equations model was used via the SMARTPLS- 3 software. Additionally, the relationship between workplace bullying and sleep well-being was examined by conducting several mediation analyzes to study the mediating role of work-related rumination in the relationship of workplace bullying and sleep well-being. Workplace bullying was inversely and significantly correlated with sleep well-being. The affective rumination was inversely and significantly correlated with sleep well-being, and detachment also correlated significantly, but positively with sleep well-being. However, the problem-solving dimension did not correlate significantly with sleep well-being. Mediation analyzes suggest that affective rumination and detachment mediate the relationship between workplace bullying and sleep well-being.

The present study assessed the effects of garlic and diallyl sulfide supplements on dry matter intake (DMI), productive performance, milk coagulation properties, cheese yield, milk and cheese sensory profiles, and rheological characteristics. Four dairy cows were fed a total mixed ration either alone (control) or supplemented with 100 or 400 g/d of garlic cloves or 2 g/d of diallyl sulfide in 4 consecutive experimental periods in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The diallyl sulfide dose was established to provide approximately the same amount of allyl thiosulfinate compounds as 100 g of fresh garlic cloves. The total mixed ration was composed of 0.29 corn silage, 0.23 corn-barley mixture, 0.17 sunflower-soybean mixture, 0.12 alfalfa hay, 0.12 grass hay, 0.04 sugar beet pulp, and 0.02 other additives, and contained 0.253 starch, 0.130 crude protein, and 0.375 neutral detergent fiber, on a dry matter basis. Each experimental period consisted of 7 d of transition and 14 d of treatment. On d 18 and 21 of each period, milk samples (10 L) were collected from each cow for chemical analysis and cheese-making. The organoleptic properties of the milk and 63-d-ripened cheeses were assessed by a panel of 7 trained sensory evaluators. The experimental treatments had no effects on DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency (milk yield/DMI), milk coagulation properties, nutrient recovery, or cheese yield. Garlic-like aroma, taste, and flavor of milk and cheese were significantly influenced by the treatments, particularly the highest dose of garlic cloves, and we found close exponential relationships between milk and cheese for garlic-like aroma (R(2) = 0.87) and garlic-like flavor (R(2) = 0.79). Diallyl sulfide and 400 g/d of garlic cloves resulted in lower pH, shear force, and shear work of ripened cheeses compared with the other treatments. Garlic cloves and diallyl sulfide had opposite effects on cheese color indices. We conclude that adding 400 g/d of garlic to the feed of lactating dairy cows highly influences the sensory and rheological characteristics of cheese.",0,935

Nanotechnology 27(30","Analysis and optimization of silicon nano-structured geometry (black silicon) for photovoltaic applications has been reported. It is seen that a unique class of geometry: micro-nanostructure has the potential to find a balance between the conflicting interests of reduced reflection for wide angles of incidence, reduced surface area enhancement due to the nano-structuring of the substrate and reduced material wastage due to the etching of the silicon substrate to realize the geometry itself. It is established that even optimally designed micro-nanostructures would not be useful for conventional wafer based approaches. The work presents computational studies on how such micro-nanostructures are more potent for future ultra-thin monocrystalline silicon absorbers. For such ultra-thin absorbers, the optimally designed micro-nanostructures provide additional advantages of advanced light management capabilities as it behaves as a lossy 2D photonic crystal making the physically thin absorber optically thick along with the ability to collect photo-generated carriers orthogonal to the direction of light (radial junction) for unified photon-electron harvesting. Most significantly, the work answers the key question on how thin the monocrystalline solar absorber should be so that optimum micro-nanostructure would be able to harness the incident photons ensuring proper collection so as to reach the well-known Shockley-Queisser limit of solar cells. Flexible ultra-thin monocrystalline silicon solar cells have been fabricated using nanosphere lithography and MacEtch technique along with a synergistic association of crystalline and amorphous silicon technologies to demonstrate its physical and technological flexibilities. The outcomes are relevant so that nanotechnology may be seamlessly integrated into the technology roadmap of monocrystalline silicon solar cells as the silicon thickness should be significantly reduced without compromising the efficiency within the next decade.",0,937

American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology 299(3","Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid abundant in fish oil that exerts a wide spectrum of documented beneficial health effects in humans. Because dietary interventions are relatively inexpensive and are widely assumed to be safe, they have broad public appeal. Their endorsement can potentially have a major impact on human health, but hard mechanistic evidence that specifies how these derivatives work at the cellular level is limited. EPA (50 microM) caused a small elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]) in intact NCM460 human colonic epithelial cells as measured by fura 2 and a profound drop of [Ca(2+)] within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of permeabilized cells as monitored by compartmentalized mag-fura 2. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that this loss of ER store [Ca(2+)] led to translocation of the ER-resident transmembrane Ca(2+) sensor STIM1. Using sensitive FRET-based sensors for cAMP in single cells, we further found that EPA caused a substantial increase in cellular cAMP concentration, a large fraction of which was dependent on the drop in ER [Ca(2+)], but independent of cytosolic Ca(2+). An additional component of the EPA-induced cAMP signal was sensitive to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine. We conclude that EPA slowly releases ER Ca(2+) stores, resulting in the generation of cAMP. The elevated cAMP is apparently independent of classical G protein-coupled receptor activation and is likely the consequence of a newly described ""store-operated"" cAMP signaling pathway that is mediated by STIM1.",0,938

Developments in ophthalmology 50: 29-36.","Filtering surgery evolved from the classic trabeculectomy, in which penetration into the anterior chamber is a necessary step, toward nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy. The first procedure presents several serious complications such as durable hypotony, hyphema, flat anterior chamber, choroidal detachment, endophthalmitis and surgery-induced cataract. To avoid such drawbacks, a novel nonpenetrating technique was designed to improve predictability of the intraocular pressure-lowering action, while reducing the incidence of the immediate postoperative complications encountered with the penetrating method. This surgery works by building up new outflow pathways for the drainage of the aqueous humor while keeping intact the integrity of the anterior chamber. Deep sclerectomy acts at the bulk of main resistance to aqueous humor egress, located at the juxtacanalicular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal. It consists of dissection of these two structures while keeping a thin filtering membrane though which aqueous humor is being drained. The membrane prevents overfiltration and ensures a reproducible postoperative intraocular pressure. This surgery is indicated for most of glaucoma except angle closure and neovascular cases. The procedure consists in opening the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule and creating a 5 × 5 mm limbus-based superficial scleral flap. A deeper scleral flap measuring about 4 × 4 mm is dissected and the roof of Schlemm's canal is removed. A space maintainer is inserted and the flap and conjunctiva are closed.

Using 0.5 μM Py3MeO-TBPo, flow cytometry studies demonstrated an increase of intracellular drug levels related to the incubation time, reaching a maximum at 18 h. LysoTracker(®) Green (LTG) and MitoTracker(®) Green (MTG) probes were used to identify the subcellular localization. Upon exposure to ultraviolet excitation, red porphycene fluorescence was detected as red granules in the cytoplasm that colocalized with LTG. No significant toxic effects were detected for Py3MeO-TBPo in the dark at concentrations below 1 μM. In contrast, Py3MeO-TBPo combined with red-light irradiation induced concentration- and fluence-dependent HeLa cells inactivation. Besides, all photodynamic protocols assayed induced a clear effect of cell detachment inhibition after trypsin treatment. Both apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms can occur in HeLa cells depending on the experimental protocol. After 18 h incubation with 0.5 μM Py3MeO-TBPo and subsequent red light irradiation (3.6 J/cm(2)), a high number of cells die by apoptosis, as evaluated by morphological alterations, immunofluorescent relocalization of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, and TUNEL assay. Likewise, immunofluorescence techniques showed that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into cytosol in cells undergoing apoptosis, which occurs immediately after relocation of Bax in mitochondria. The highest amount of apoptosis appeared 24 h after treatment (70%) and this cell death occurred without cell detachment to the substrate. In contrast, with 0.75 μM Py3MeO-TBPo and 3.6 J/cm(2) irradiation, morphological changes showed a preferential necrotic cell death. Singlet oxygen was identified as the cytotoxic agent involved in cell photoinactivation. Moreover, cell cultures pre-exposed to the singlet oxygen scavenger sodium azide showed pronounced protection against the loss of viability induced by Py3MeO-TBPo and light. Different changes in distribution and organization of cytoskeletal elements (microtubules and actin microfilaments) as well as the protein vinculin, after apoptotic and necrotic photodynamic treatments have been analyzed. Neither of these two cell death mechanisms (apoptosis or necrosis) induced cell detachment. In summary, Py3MeO-TBPo appears to meet the requirements for further scrutiny as a very good photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy: it is water soluble, has a high absorption in the red spectral region (where light penetration in tissue is higher), and is able to induce effective high apoptotic rate (70%) related to the more widely studied photosensitizers.",0,941

A common reform-the introduction of inter-professional teams into traditional PC settings-has been difficult to implement despite financial investment and enthusiasm.ObjectiveTo synthesize findings across five jurisdictions in three countries to identify common contextual factors influencing the successful implementation of teamwork within PC practices.MethodsAn international consortium of researchers met via teleconference and regular face-to-face meetings using a Collaborative Reflexive Deliberative Approach to re-analyse and synthesize their published and unpublished data and their own work experience. Studies were evaluated through reflection and facilitated discussion to identify factors associated with successful teamwork implementation. Matrices were used to summarize interpretations from the studies.ResultsSeven common levers influence a jurisdiction's ability to implement PC teams. Team-based PC was promoted when funding extended beyond fee-for-service, where care delivery did not require direct physician involvement and where governance was inclusive of non-physician disciplines. Other external drivers included: the health professional organizations' attitude towards team-oriented PC, the degree of external accountability required of practices, and the extent of their links with the community and medical neighbourhood. Programs involving outreach facilitation, leadership training and financial support for team activities had some effect.ConclusionThe combination of physician dominance and physician aligned fee-for-service payment structures provide a profound barrier to implement team-oriented PC.

In the present work we demonstrate the possibility of fast and reversible photocontrol of the optical properties of cholesteric polymer networks. Several cholesteric photopolymerizable mixtures are prepared, and porous cholesteric network films with different helix pitches are produced by polymerization of these mixtures. An effective and simple method of the introduction of photochromic azobenzene-containing nematic mixture capable of isothermal photoinducing the nematic-isotropic phase transition into the porous polymer matrix is developed. It is found that cross-linking density and degree of polymer network filling with a photochromic nematic mixture strongly influence the photo-optical behavior of the obtained composite films. In particular, the densely cross-linked films are characterized by a decrease in selective light reflection bandwidth, whereas weakly cross-linked systems display two processes: the shift of selective light reflection peak and decrease of its width.

The aims of the present study were firstly to characterize psychiatric patients with ASD in regard to demographical factors, psychiatric comorbidity and personality traits and compare the ASD group with a psychiatric control group in these respects. Secondly, we wanted to compare differences of personality traits between females and males in the ASD group. Method: Adult psychiatric patients where ASD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was suspected were referred to a tertiary unit in Stockholm 2001-2006. All patients diagnosed at the unit with ASD (n = 84; 39 females and 45 males) were consecutively included and compared to all 46 identically interviewed and assessed patients who did not receive an ASD or ADHD diagnosis. Among scales used were the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), SCID II Screen, and Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP). Results: ASD patients had an equal educational level but a lower social and occupational functioning. Their GAF scores were significantly lower compared to the control group. Prior to referral, major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorders were the most common psychiatric diagnoses. In the assessment approximately 1/3 fulfilled diagnostic criteria for comorbid ADHD. The patients with ASD also had significantly more schizotypal and avoidant personality traits according to SCID II screen. In SSP, patients with ASD rated themselves significantly higher on Stress-susceptibility, Embitterment, Detachment, Trait irritability and Lack of assertiveness than controls. Females with ASD scored significantly higher than males on borderline and passive-aggressive traits according to the SCID II Screen and on Embitterment and Trait irritability in the SSP. Conclusions: We could show that psychiatric patients with ASD have a low level of functioning and a personality profile which is gender specific.

The following study was undertaken to foster a better understanding of beliefs and values that residents bring to their clinical practice.METHODSApplying 13 years of experience with one method of structured reflection and conversation, I was able to perform a cross-set analysis of findings from interactions with 143 family practice residents. Such dimensions as views of life and death, role of physician, and process of healing served as avenues to elicit beliefs and values.RESULTSThe residents' responses yielded the following six themes: philosophy and spirituality, the nature of suffering, the strains of helping, the healing relationship, the coherence of models, and clashes with the models of patients and colleagues.CONCLUSIONThese conversations with family physicians-in-training suggest that they bring to their clinical and collaborative relationships complex, highly personal models of medicine that emphasize meaning and human relationship and serve as a source of strength. To better understand these models, future work should investigate the general beliefs and values of experienced family physicians in various practice settings, how their models of medicine interact and perhaps clash with those of their patients and colleagues, and effective methods for helping family physicians articulate their views so they can function effectively in their clinical practice.",0,950

UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray energy dispersive spectrophotometer (EDAX) were performed to ascertain the formation of Ag-NPs. It was observed that the growths of Ag-NPs are stopped within 35 min of reaction time. The synthesized Ag-NPs were characterized by a peak at 446 nm in the UV-visible spectrum. XRD confirmed the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles of 27 nm size. The XRD peaks at 38°, 44°, 64° and 77° can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) Bragg's reflections of cubic structure of metallic silver, respectively. The FTIR result clearly showed that the extracts containing OH as a functional group act in capping the nanoparticles synthesis. Antibacterial activities of Ag-NPs were tested against the growth of Gram-positive (S. aureus) using SEM. The inhibition was observed in the Ag-NPs against S. aureus. The results suggest that the synthesized Ag-NPs act as an effective antibacterial agent. It is confirmed that Ag-NPs are capable of rendering high antibacterial efficacy and hence has a great potential in the preparation of used drugs against bacterial diseases. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), indicated that, the most strains of S. aureus was damaged and extensively disappeared by addition of Ag-NPs.

Previous biofilm studies lack a damage-based theoretical model to describe the biofilm separation from a surface. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the interfacial separation of a mature biofilm from a rigid glass substrate using a combined experimental and numerical modelling approach. In the current work, the biofilm-glass interfacial separation process was investigated under tensile and shear stresses at the macroscale level, known as modes I and II failure mechanisms respectively. The numerical simulations were performed using a Finite Volume (FV)-based simulation package (OpenFOAM®) to predict the separation initiation using the cohesive zone model (CZM). Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based retraction curve was used to obtain the separation properties between the biofilm and glass colloid at microscale level, where the CZM parameters were estimated using the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model. In this study CZM is introduced as a reliable method for the investigation of interfacial separation between a biofilm and rigid substrate, in which a high local stress at the interface edge acts as an ultimate stress at the crack tip.This study demonstrated that the total interfacial failure energy measured at the macroscale, was significantly higher than the pure interfacial separation energy obtained by AFM at the microscale, indicating a highly ductile deformation behaviour within the bulk biofilm matrix.

In this work carboxymethylated dextran (CMD) was prepared and used for fabricating ultrathin surface coatings. A grafting method based on covalent coupling to aminosilane- and epoxysilane-functionalized surfaces was applied to obtain thin CMD layers. The carboxyl moiety of the CMD was coupled to the aminated surface by EDC-NHS reagents, while CMD coupling through epoxysilane molecules was performed without any additional reagents. The surface analysis following the grafting procedures consisted of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS). The XPS and AFM measurements showed that the grafting resulted in a very thin dextran layer of a few nanometers. The OWLS method allowed devising the structure of the interfacial dextran layers by the evaluation of the optogeometrical parameters. The alteration in the nanostructure of the CMD layer with the chemical composition of the silane coverage and the pH of the grafting solution was revealed by in situ OWLS, specifically, lain down chains were found to be prevalent on the surface under neutral and basic conditions on epoxysilylated surfaces.

Reisman, Co-Director, Yale Internal Medicine Residency Writers' Workshop, Assistant Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine and VA Connecticut Health Care System: This issue inaugurates a new feature: selected writings from the Yale Internal Medicine Residency Program's Writers' Workshop. The annual workshop began in 2003. Abraham Verghese and Richard Selzer, among the best known physician-writers in the United States, have served as workshop leaders, teaching the craft of writing to more than 35 residents. In designing the workshop with my co-director, Dr. Asghar Rastegar, our aim was to make participants better physicians by providing a creative outlet for reflection. The tempo of a resident's day is typically furious - one patient dies, perhaps, another sickens, a third refuses a necessary procedure, a fourth's wife cries inconsolably at the bedside - with no time in between to ponder what happened, much less what it meant to the patient or to the resident and how it might shape the way the resident practices medicine in the future. Without time to muse about the experience, many residents take the easy road: They emotionally detach. Writing, we believe, can be an antidote to this tendency. The exercise of writing not only makes us empathic; it also sharpens our diagnostic skills. One of the keys to compelling writing is attention to detail: the nervous twitch of an old man's eye muscles or the decayed front teeth of a young woman, a former crack addict. Such details not only make our writing come alive but also sensitize us to our patients' plights and sharpen our diagnostic skills. The stories and essays written by the Writers' Workshop participants present a range of experiences, real and imagined, and take us deep into the minds of young doctors trying to make sense of what they do.",0,957

The aim of the present work is to develop and optimize thermosensitive gels using Pluronic (F-127) for enhancing transport of SL into the brain through the nasal route. SL gels were prepared using a cold method and the Box-Behnken experimental design methodology. Drug (SL), gelling agent (F-127), and emulsifier (Propylene glycol, PG) were selected as independent variables, while the gelation temperature, gel strength, pH, gel content, and gel erosion were considered as dependent variables. For further understanding of the interaction between the various variables, contour plots and surface plots were also applied. Selected formulations, like S10 (contain 25 mg SL, 20 g F-127, and 1 g PG) and S14 (contain 50 mg SL, 18 g F-127 and 1 g PG), had a clear appearance in the sol form, with gelling temperature of the nasal gel ranging between 33 and 34, respectively. The gel strength of the formulations varied from 4.67 and 0.68 mm and the drug content was 100%. The pH of the formulations ranged between 6.71 and 7.11.

Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice 18(1","RATIONALEReflective portfolios have been widely trailed in vocational programmes for health sciences education. While not raised explicitly yet, there is recognition that an essential part of a portfolio may still be missing - that is the experience of theoretical and analytic questioning that should occur after reflection.AIMS AND OBJECTIVESIn this paper, we argue that portfolios require both reflective and reasoned components to provide a more complete range of educational experiences for postgraduate doctors in the pursuit of higher qualifications.METHODSWe describe the differentiating features between the two components and conclude with some suggestions on how both reflective and reasoned components of portfolios may work synergistically through a series of case studies.RESULTSThe reflective style of portfolio, which is in current use, has been widely accepted as a major advance in postgraduate medical education at all levels. It provides an effective vehicle for encouraging self-consideration and generalizability. It is an important adjunct where it functions as a personal development tool as well as a sophisticated log book. A reasoned or pedagogic element encourages more analytic activities: adding an additional component that can ground the portfolio in theory or research. The portfolio is then able to function in a range of academic spheres and provide a theoretical platform for the wide range of non-clinical empirical work undertaken in clinical settings. The addition of a reasoned component also increases the emphasis on the introduction of new concepts outside the sphere of the learner's experience.CONCLUSIONSA portfolio containing both reflective and reasoned components is then able to function in a range of academic spheres and provide a theoretical platform for the wide range of non-clinical empirical work undertaken in clinical settings. In an iterative mode, such a portfolio element can support a forum for questioning established concepts within a pedagogical environment - the essence of evidence-based practice.",0,961

The Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ; McEvoy et al., 2010) was developed to meet this need, and its psychometric properties and capacity to predict psychopathology have been tested in undergraduate and clinically anxious samples. METHODS: We administered the RTQ to currently depressed (n = 29), formerly depressed (n = 61) and never-depressed (n = 93) community participants. RESULTS: The RTQ demonstrated good psychometric properties, with excellent internal consistency for the RNT subscale (alpha=.93) and good convergent validity with measures of negative affect and psychopathology symptoms (rs= .47-.61). In addition, and in accord with our predictions, currently depressed and recovered depressed participants reported more RNT than never-depressed participants, but currently and recovered depressed participants did not differ. In addition, RNT scores explained additional variance in depression and anxiety symptoms, after controlling for gender, age, neuroticism, state negative affect, and intolerance of uncertainty. LIMITATIONS: Our sample was drawn from the community but participants were not treatment-seeking, and we employed a cross-sectional design. DISCUSSION: Taken together with previous experimental and longitudinal studies, our results support the utility of addressing RNT in the treatment and prevention of relapse in depression. Moreover, these data confirm the utility of the RTQ as a brief, transdiagnostic self-report measure of RNT.",0,963

Therefore, we investigated the impact of crude oil on the bacterial, diatom and archaeal communities within the upper parts of the diatom-dominated sediment and the biofilm that detached from the surface at high tide. Biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons was rapid, with a 50 % decrease in concentration in the 0-2-mm section of sediment by 3 days, indicating the presence of a primed hydrocarbon-degrading community. The biggest oil-induced change was in the biofilm that detached from the sediment, with increased relative abundance of several types of diatom and of the obligately hydrocarbonoclastic Oleibacter sp., which constituted 5 % of the pyrosequences in the oiled floating biofilm on day 3 compared to 0.6 % in the non-oiled biofilm. Differences in bacterial community composition between oiled and non-oiled samples from the 0-2-mm section of sediment were only significant at days 12 to 28, and the 2-4-mm-sediment bacterial communities were not significantly affected by oil. However, specific members of the Chromatiales were detected (1 % of sequences in the 2-4-mm section) only in the oiled sediment, supporting other work that implicates them in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation. Unlike the Bacteria, the archaeal communities were not significantly affected by oil. In fact, changes in community composition over time, perhaps caused by decreased nutrient concentration and changes in grazing pressure, overshadowed the effect of oil for both Bacteria and Archaea. Many obligate hydrocarbonoclastic and generalist oil-degrading bacteria were isolated, and there was little correspondence between the isolates and the main taxa detected by pyrosequencing of sediment-extracted DNA, except for Alcanivorax, Thalassolituus, Cycloclasticus and Roseobacter spp., which were detected by both methods.",0,966

These pathologies are characterized by excessive pre-retinal blood vessel growth that can ultimately lead to a fibrous scar formation and culminate in retinal detachment.

In Group A (n=9) 0.2 μl balanced salt solution (BSS) and in Group B (n=22), 0.2 μl biopolymer was injected in the subretinal space. Trans-scleral subretinal injection was performed in one eye and the fellow eye was used as control. In both groups, in vivo color fundus photography, electroretinogram (ERG), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were performed before injection and at days 7 and 14 post-intervention. Histological analysis was performed following euthanization at days 1, 7 and 21 post-injection.RESULTSThe biopolymer was visualized in the subretinal space in vivo by SD-OCT and post-life by histology up to 1 week after the injection. There were no significant differences in ERG parameters between the two groups at 1 and 2 weeks post-injection. Minimal inflammatory response and loss of photoreceptor cells was only observed in the immediate proximity of the site of scleral perforation, which was similar in both groups.

The distribution of allowable glucose and ammonia uptake rates showed a triangular shape, the apex corresponding to maximum growth rate. The exact shape, e.g. the diagonal boundary is determined by the relative amounts of nutrients required for growth. The logarithm of flux values has a normal distribution, e.g. there is a log normal distribution, and most of the reactions have an order of magnitude between 10(-1) and 1. The increase in the number of blocked reactions as growth switched from aerobic to micro-aerobic phase and the presence of alternate networks for a single optimal solution were both reflections of the variability of pathway utilization for survival and growth. Principal component analysis (PCA) provided us with significant clues on the correlations between individual reactions and correlations between sets of reactions. Furthermore, PCA identified the most influential reactions of the system. The PCA score plots clearly distinguish two different growth phases, micro-aerobic and aerobic. The loading plots for each growth phase showed both the impact of the reactions on the model and the clustering of reactions that are highly correlated.

Hence, fixed bearing or mobile bearing designs with large contact areas throughout the full range of flexion wear less than partially conforming fixed-bearing designs. This hypothesis was investigated in an experimental model, where flat-ended ultra high molecular weight polyethylene pins of varying diameters were reciprocated and rotated on polished metal plates under a constant load with serum lubrication. The pin diameters ranged from 8-23 mm, giving nominal contact pressures from 23.9-2.8 MPa, covering the range associated with a wide spectrum of total knees including mobile-bearings. For pin diameters of 8-12 mm, the mean wear rates were in the range of 5.0-16.0 E-10 g/cycle. For diameters of 17 and 23 mm, the mean wear rates were approximately 1.0 E-10 g/cycle. The latter wear rates were significantly less than the former. Scanning electron microscopy indicated milder wear processes with the larger diameters, while the smaller diameters exhibited transverse ripples and cracks and detachment of thin layers from the surface. The percentages of granules (mostly submicron), fibrils and flakes, and the sizes of these particle types were similar among all pin diameters, except that, for the 23 mm pin diameter, the percentage of fibrils increased and of flakes decreased.

Many previous experimental studies have suggested that the proton transfer from Asp96 to the Schiff base occurs under the following two conditions: (1) the hydrogen bond between Thr46 and Asp96 breaks and Thr46 is detached from Asp96 and (2) a stable chain of four water molecules spans an area from Asp96 --> Schiff base. In this work, we successfully reproduced the proton-transfer process occurring under these two conditions by molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations. The quantum chemical computation revealed that the proton transfer from Asp96 to Shiff base occurs in two-step reactions via an intermediate in which an H(3)O(+) appears around Ala215. The activation energy for the proton transfer in the first reaction was calculated to be 9.7 kcal/mol, which enables fast and efficient proton pump action. Further QM/MM (quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical) and FMO (fragment molecular orbital) calculations revealed that the potential energy change during the proton transfer is tightly regulated by the composition and the geometry of the surrounding amino acid residues of bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we report in detail the Asp96 --> Schiff base proton translocation mechanism of bacteriorhodopsin.

While conventional box models are incapable of modeling the experimental data at high momentum transfer satisfactorily, a quasimolecular composition-space refinement approach using distribution functions to map the spatial organization of submolecular headgroup fragments yields a much better description and overcomes inherent difficulties of box models. Upon going from the fluid liquid-expanded (LE) phase to the hexatic liquid-condensed (LC) phase, the orientation of the headgroup is tightly coupled to the ordering of the acyl chains. Headgroups tilt toward the surface normal to accommodate for the large reduction in available area per lipid molecule. The spread of the headgroup fragment distribution is considerably larger than the global interface roughness and increases slightly with compression. In distinction to earlier work on DMPE using the two-box approach, we find that the phosphate hydration stays essentially constant across the whole isotherm. The discrepancy between the results observed with the different models is attributed to intrinsic deficiencies of the box model.",0,977

Topics in spinal cord injury rehabilitation 23(3","Background: A personal health record (PHR) is a collection of electronic health data drawn from multiple sources but managed by the patient. The PHR is a strategy that enables patients to be proactive in the coordination of their care. Objective: The purpose of this clinical improvement study was to discover what worked, what did not work, and what could be improved in the initial implementation of MyPHR, a PHR tailored to patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), to make it a useful tool for care coordination and health self-management. Methods: Five individuals with chronic (>1 year) SCI carried out trial use of MyPHR. Twelve hours of interactions, including screen navigation and think-aloud reflection, were recorded and analyzed using formative research, a qualitative method and type of case study research. Results: Two key themes emerged to guide the implementation of PHR technology: selectivity in the identification of information for the patient to track, and continual support and communication with the clinical team. Conclusion: Given the volume of electronic data available to patients with SCI, the data identified to import, manage, and keep current in a PHR have to be thoughtfully selected to make sure the patient is convinced of the worth of this data record and is willing to invest the time and effort it will take to maintain it. A PHR should be implemented with a deliberate focus on its function as a tool that patients and providers use together to expand communication as they work toward their common goal of optimizing health after SCI.",0,978

Applied optics 57(18","In scanning laser triangulation sensors for 3D imaging, the achievable throughput is strongly limited by the moving mass. By realizing an optical scanning approach rather than repositioning the entire sensor, this limitation could be reduced, leading to a reduced measurement time. This work presents sensor system geometries in which only the optical path of a line triangulation sensor is manipulated by a tip-tilt mirror. In the proposed rotational scanning systems, either the illumination path or both the illumination and the reflection path are manipulated. By using ray-tracing simulation, the performance of the scanning systems are optimized and possible disadvantages can be determined up front. Using geometric relations, the surface profile can be reconstructed from the measured sensor data, the mirror position, and the model parameters. Experimental results show that the image quality of the proposed rotational scanning systems is comparable to systems based on classical translational scanning motion.",0,979

A 119(41","UNLABELLEDMany chemical concepts hinge on the notion of an orbital called the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, or LUMO. This hypothetical orbital and the much more concrete highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) constitute the two ""frontier orbitals"", which rationalize a great deal of chemistry. A viable LUMO candidate should have a sensible energy value, a realistic shape with amplitude on those atoms where electron attachment or reduction or excitation processes occur, and often an antibonding correspondence to one of the highest occupied MOs. Unfortunately, today's quantum chemistry calculations do not yield useful empty orbitals. Instead, the empty canonical orbitals form a large sea of orbitals, where the interesting valence antibonds are scrambled with the basis set's polarization and diffuse augmentations. The LUMO is thus lost within a continuum associated with a detached electron, as well as many Rydberg excited states. A suitable alternative to the canonical orbitals is proposed, namely, the valence virtual orbitals. VVOs are found by a simple algorithm based on singular value decomposition, which allows for the extraction of all valence-like orbitals from the large empty canonical orbital space. VVOs are found to be nearly independent of the working basis set. The utility of VVOs is demonstrated for construction of qualitative MO diagrams, for prediction of valence excited states, and as starting orbitals for more sophisticated calculations. This suggests that VVOs are a suitable realization of the LUMO, LUMO + 1, ...CONCEPTVVO generation requires no expert knowledge, as the number of VVOs sought is found by counting s-block atoms as having only a valence s orbital, transition metals as having valence s and d, and main group atoms as being valence s and p elements.

The system described in this work is based on free cascadable and programmable true-color sensors for real-time recognition and identification of individual weed and crop plants. The application of this type of sensor is suitable for municipal areas and farmland with and without crops to perform the site-specific application of herbicides. Initially, databases with reflection properties of plants, natural and artificial backgrounds were created. Crop and weed plants should be recognized by the use of mathematical algorithms and decision models based on these data. They include the characteristic color spectrum, as well as the reflectance characteristics of unvegetated areas and areas with organic material. The CIE-Lab color-space was chosen for color matching because it contains information not only about coloration (a- and b-channel), but also about luminance (L-channel), thus increasing accuracy. Four different decision making algorithms based on different parameters are explained: (i) color similarity (ΔE); (ii) color similarity split in ΔL, Δa and Δb; (iii) a virtual channel 'd' and (iv) statistical distribution of the differences of reflection backgrounds and plants. Afterwards, the detection success of the recognition system is described. Furthermore, the minimum weed/plant coverage of the measuring spot was calculated by a mathematical model. Plants with a size of 1-5% of the spot can be recognized, and weeds in the two-leaf stage can be identified with a measuring spot size of 5 cm. By choosing a decision model previously, the detection quality can be increased. Depending on the characteristics of the background, different models are suitable. Finally, the results of field trials on municipal areas (with models of plants), winter wheat fields (with artificial plants) and grassland (with dock) are shown. In each experimental variant, objects and weeds could be recognized.",0,981

Journal of theoretical biology 430: 141-156.","Epithelial cells can be triggered to actively detach from epithelial tissues and become solitary, migratory and invasive. This process occurs repeatedly in development, where it is termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and can be recapitulated as epithelial scattering in cell culture models. Detachment of cell-cell junctions involves changes in contractile forces, actin cytoskeletal organization, changes in cell-substrate adhesion properties, surface presentation of cell-cell adhesion molecules, and gene expression. That these cellular processes affect each other and share molecular components creates difficulties in generating hypotheses and designing experiments to understand the mechanics of epithelial scattering. Computational modeling is proving a powerful too in such instances. Here we develop a cellular automaton to reveal insights into how cells rupture epithelial cell-cell junctions during scattering. The model is optimized for realistic and stable recapitulation of behavior of single cells, then for realistic simulation of multiple cells forming epithelial colonies. With a workable model of epithelial cell behavior, we then alter model parameters and assess whether we can realistically mimic epithelial scattering. Adjusting model parameters to recapitulate epithelial scattering reveals that induction of cell migration is the major driver of epithelial scattering.",0,982

One challenge for the field is the design and implementation of effective training to support home visiting staff. In part due to a lack of formal training, most home visitors need to develop the majority of their skills on the job. Home visitors typically receive training in their agency's specific model (e.g., HFA, NFP) and, if applicable, curriculum. Increasingly, states and other home visiting systems are developing and/or coordinating more extensive training and support systems beyond model-specific and curricula trainings. To help guide these training efforts and future evaluations of them, this paper reviews research on effective training, particularly principles of training transfer and adult learning. Description Our review summarizes several meta-analyses, reviews, and more recent publications on training transfer and adult learning principles. Assessment Effective training involves not only the introduction and modeling of concepts and skills but also the practice of, evaluation of, and reflection upon these skills. Further, ongoing encouragement of, reward for, and reflection upon use of these skills, particularly by a home visitor's supervisor, are critical for the home visitor's continued use of these skills with families. Conclusion Application of principles of adult learning and training transfer to home visiting training will likely lead to greater transfer of skills from the training environment to work with families. The involvement of both home visitors and their supervisors in training is likely important for this transfer to occur.",0,985

Several nanoethicists have recently identified the need for 'better' ethics of emerging technologies, arguing that ethical reflection should become part and parcel of the research and development (R&D) process itself. Such new forms of ethical deliberation, it is argued, transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries and require the active engagement and involvement of both nanoethicists and nanoscientists with the broader issues surrounding technological developments. Whereas significant research efforts into multi- and interdisciplinary collaborations during R&D processes are now emerging, opportunities for encouraging multidisciplinary engagement through education have remained relatively underexplored. This paper argues that educational programmes could be a natural extension of ongoing collaborative research efforts 'in the lab' and analyses how the Nanobio-RAISE courses could be used as a model for course development. In addition to exploring how the elements that were conducive to multidisciplinary engagement in this course could be preserved in future courses, this paper suggests shifting the emphasis from public communication towards ethical deliberation. Further course work could thus build capacity among both nanoscientists and nanoethicists for doing 'better' nanoethics.",0,987

The data were analyzed using the two-way Z test.METHODSAll patients were managed in a similar manner with noninvasive treatment initially, followed by injections, and finally surgical intervention in those who failed conservative measures. Return to work rates and work disability were determined at either final follow-up or at the last doctor's visit before loss to follow-up.RESULTS270 of 531 patients were diagnosed with a symptomatic one or two level disc herniation by a cervical magnetic resonance imaging scan. Fifty-four patients were insured through the workers' compensation board, and 216 reported their crash as a personal injury claim. In the WC group the work disability at 3 months follow-up revealed a cumulative 2,262 total lost days of work (average 37.1 days per person). At the point of maximal medical improvement (MMI) or 2-year follow-up, total days lost from work were 7,107 (average 131.6 days per person.) In the personal injury non-WC group, the 3-month follow-up of lost days of work was 1,093 days (average 5.1 days per person.) At 2 years follow-up, the total lost days of work were 6,206 (average 28.7 days per person.)CONCLUSIONSParticipants compensated through the workers' compensation system demonstrated a significant loss of days of work as compared with injured patients who received compensation by other means. This may be a reflection of the guaranteed method of compensation afforded to WC patients as opposed to patients who receive no form of financial support (i.e., personal injury) during the recuperative process.

Ultrasonics 77: 203-213.","The purpose of this work was to determine the influence of standing waves and possible multiple reflections under the conditions often encountered in examining the effects of ultrasound exposure on the cell cultures in vitro. More specifically, the goal was to quantitatively ascertain the influence of ultrasound exposure under free field (FF) and standing waves (SW) and multiple reflections (MR) conditions (SWMR) on the biological endpoint (50% cell necrosis). Such information would help in designing the experiments, in which the geometry of the container with biological tissue may prevent FF conditions to be established and in which the ultrasound generated temperature elevation is undesirable. This goal was accomplished by performing systematic, side-by-side experiments in vitro with C6 rat glioma cancer cells using 12 well and 96 well plates. It was determined that to obtain 50% of cell viability using the 12 well plates, the spatial average, temporal average (ISATA) intensities of 0.32W/cm2 and 5.89W/cm2 were needed under SWMR and FF conditions, respectively. For 96 well plates the results were 0.80W/cm2 and 2.86W/cm2 respectively. The corresponding, hydrophone measured pRMS maximum pressure amplitude values, were 0.71MPa, 0.75MPa, 0.75MPa and 0.73MPa, respectively. These results suggest that pRMS pressure amplitude was independent of the measurement set-up geometry and hence could be used to predict the cells' mortality threshold under any in vitro experimental conditions or even as a starting point for (pre-clinical) in vivo tests. The described procedure of the hydrophone measurements of the pRMS maximum pressure amplitude at the λ/2 distance (here 0.75mm) from the cell's level at the bottom of the dish or plate provides the guideline allowing the difference between the FF and SWMR conditions to be determined in any experimental setup. The outcome of the measurements also indicates that SWMR exposure might be useful at any ultrasound assisted therapy experiments as it permits to reduce thermal effects. Although the results presented are valid for the experimental conditions used in this study they can be generalized. The analysis developed provides methodology facilitating independent laboratories to determine their specific ultrasound exposure parameters for a given biological end-point under standing waves and multiple reflections conditions. The analysis also permits verification of the outcome of the experiments mimicking pre- and clinical environment between different, unaffiliated teams of researchers.",0,990

Since the structure of the Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP complex showed RanBP1 to be located away from the active site, we reinvestigated the reaction using fluorescence spectroscopy under pre-steady-state conditions. We can show that RanBP1 indeed does not influence the rate-limiting step of the reaction, which is the cleavage of GTP and/or the release of product P(i). It does, however, influence the dynamics of the Ran-RanGAP interaction, its most dramatic effect being the 20-fold stimulation of the already very fast association reaction such that it is under diffusion control (4.5 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1)). Having established a valuable kinetic system for the interaction analysis, we also found, in contrast to previous findings, that the highly conserved acidic C-terminal end of RanGAP is not required for the switch-off reaction.

In anorexia nervosa (AN), forgoing food intake despite emaciation and endocrine signals that promote eating is an example of ""too much"" self-control. Here we investigated whether voluntary emotion regulation in AN patients comes with associated disorder-relevant costs. Thirty-five patients with acute AN and thirty-five age-matched healthy controls (HCs) performed an established emotion regulation paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging after an overnight fast. The task required reducing emotions induced by positively valenced pictures via distancing. We calculated a neural regulation score from responses recorded in a reward-related brain region of interest (ventral striatum; VS) by subtracting activation measured on ""positive distance"" trials from that elicited under the ""positive watch"" (baseline) condition. Complementing the imaging data, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to probe disorder-related rumination and affect six times/day for 2 weeks following the scanning session. The neural regulation score indicating reduced VS activation during emotion regulation was used as a predictor in hierarchical linear models with EMA measures as outcomes. No group differences in neural activity were found for the main contrasts of the task. However, regulation of VS activity was associated with increased body-related rumination and increased negative affect in AN, but not in HC. In line with this finding, correlational analysis with longitudinal BMI measurements revealed a link between greater VS regulation and poorer treatment outcome after 60 and 90 days. Together, these results identify a neural correlate of altered emotion regulation in AN, which seems to be detrimental to psychological well-being and may interfere with recovery.",0,992

Clinical rotations in ICUs elicit and emphasize the struggles house officers face on a daily basis throughout their training. METHOD: These struggles were recorded by hundreds of residents in a journal maintained in the Massachusetts General Hospital's Medical ICU for the past 20 years. We systematically reviewed these unsolicited entries to define and to illustrate how house officers respond to caring for terminally ill patients. The 3 overarching topics that surfaced repeatedly were assessment of terminally ill patients, reaction to their prognosis, and management of their disease or their eventual demise. RESULTS: House officers record affective reactions and cognitive assessments to cope with the stress and dysfunction associated with the care of the critically ill and to facilitate their management of these patients. Journal entries by residents reveal a deep concern for the welfare of their patients, conflict about the technological advances and limitations of the system, and reflection on how involved physicians should become with their patients. CONCLUSION: House officer journal entries reflect a combination of newly gained medical knowledge and coping strategies in managing terminally ill patients. House officers also demonstrate a deep concern for the welfare of their patients. Insight from years of reflection from past house officers can help prepare trainees and residency programs for the breadth and intensity of the ICU experience and for work in clinical practice settings that follow completion of training.",0,993

However, on the one hand little is known on what justification precisely means to scientists, and on the other the position held by philosophers of science on what it entails is rather limited; for justifications customarily refer to the written form (textual expressions) of scientific claims, leaving aside images, which, as many cases from the history of science show are relevant to this process. The fact that images can visually express scientific claims independently from text, plus their vast variety and origins, requires an assessment of the way they are currently justified and in turn used as sources to justify scientific claims in the case of particular scientific fields. Similarly, in view of the different nature of images, analysis is required to determine on what side of the philosophical distinction between data and phenomena these different kinds of images fall. This paper historicizes and documents a particular aspect of contemporary life sciences research: the use of the molecular image as vehicle of knowledge production in cell studies, a field that has undergone a significant shift in visual expressions from the early 1980s onwards. Focussing on textbooks as sources that have been overlooked in the historiography of contemporary biomedicine, the aim is to explore (1) whether the shift of cell studies, entailing a superseding of the optical image traditionally conceptualised as primary data, by the molecular image, corresponds with a shift of justificatory practices, and (2) to assess the role of the molecular image as primary data. This paper also explores the dual role of images as teaching resources and as resources for the construction of knowledge in cell studies especially in its relation to discovery and justification. Finally, this paper seeks to stimulate reflection on what kind of archival resources could benefit the work of present and future epistemic historians in particular those interested on the role of images as sources of training and knowledge production in scientific disciplines.",0,994

With the introduction of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), there is a growing trend towards the use of PPV for treatment of retinal detachment. There is a reluctance to perform scleral buckling (SB) in RRD due to the perceived steep learning curve, declining mastery over indirect ophthalmoscopy, and poor ergonomics associated with SB. In this article, we discuss the surgical challenges and tips to overcome these in four headings: localization of the break, retinopexy, SB, and subretinal fluid (SRF) drainage. Localization of the break can be performed by the use of forceps or illuminated scleral depressor. It can be facilitated by prior drainage of SRF in cases with bullous RRD. Chandelier with wide-angle viewing system can be used for easier localization of break and cryopexy. Sutureless buckling and suprachoroidal buckling are easier and faster alternatives to the conventional technique. Reshaping the silicone segment helps in accommodating the wider circumferential band. Modified needle drainage, laser choroidotomy, and infusion-assisted drainage can make SRF drainage easier and safer. The above techniques and other practical tips have been explained in detail with the illustrations to make the process of learning the art of SB easier.",0,999

Nanoscale research letters 11(1","Surface-textured structure is currently an interesting topic since it can efficiently reduce the optical losses in advanced optoelectronic devices via light management. In this work, we built a model in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions by setting the simulation parameters based on the morphology of the Si nanostructures and compared with the experimental results in order to study the anti-reflection behaviors of the present nano-patterned structures. It is found that the reflectance is gradually reduced by increasing the depth of Si nanostructures which is in well agreement with the experimental observations. The reflectance can be lower than 10 % in the light range from 400 to 850 nm for Si nano-patterned structures with a depth of 150 nm despite the quite low aspect ratio, which can be understood as the formation of gradually changed index layer and the scattering effect of Si nano-patterned structures. By depositing the Si quantum dots/SiO2 multilayers on nano-patterned Si substrate, the reflectance can be further suppressed and the luminescence intensity centered at 820 nm from Si quantum dots is enhanced by 6.6-fold compared with that of flat one, which can be attributed to the improved light extraction efficiency. However, the further etch time causes the reduction of luminescence intensity from Si quantum dots which may ascribe to the serious surface recombination of carriers.",0,1000

These efforts led to federal regulations developed by the U.S. Office of Minority Health requiring health care organizations to provide Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services. Based on ethnographic research at workshops and conferences, in-depth interviews with cultural competence trainers, and an analysis of postings to a moderated listserv with 2,000 members, we explore cultural competence trainings as a new type of social technology in which health care providers and institutions are urged to engage in ethical self-fashioning to eliminate prejudice and embody the values of cultural relativism. Health care providers are called on to re-orient their practice (such as habits of gaze, touch, and decision-making) and to act on their own subjectivities to develop an orientation toward Others that is 'culturally competent.' We explore the diverse methods that cultural competence trainings use to foster a health care provider’s ability to be self-reflexive, including face-to-face workshops and classes and self-guided on-line modules. We argue that the hybrid formation of culturally appropriate health care is becoming detached from its social justice origins as it becomes rationalized by and more firmly embedded in the operations of the health care marketplace.

BMC Psychiatry 12.","Background: Depression is a common condition that typically has a relapsing course. Effective interventions targeting relapse have the potential to dramatically reduce the point prevalence of the condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based intervention that has shown efficacy in reducing depressive relapse. While trials of MBCT to date have met the core requirements of phase 1 translational research, there is a need now to move to phase 2 translational research—the application of MBCT within real-world settings with a view to informing policy and clinical practice. The aim of this trial is to examine the clinical impact and health economics of MBCT under real-world conditions and where efforts have been made to assess for and prevent resentful demoralization among the control group. Secondary aims of the project involve extending the phase 1 agenda to an examination of the effects of co-morbidity and mechanisms of action. Methods/Design: This study is designed as a prospective, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a group comparison design between involving the intervention, MBCT, and a self-monitoring comparison condition, Depression Relapse Active Monitoring (DRAM). Follow-up is over 2 years. The design of the study indicates recruitment from primary and secondary care of 204 participants who have a history of 3 or more episodes of Major Depression but who are currently well. Measures assessing depressive relapse/recurrence, time to first clinical intervention, treatment expectancy and a range of secondary outcomes and process variables are included. A health economics evaluation will be undertaken to assess the incremental cost of MBCT. Discussion: The results of this trial, including an examination of clinical, functional and health economic outcomes, will be used to assess the role that this treatment approach may have in recommendations for treatment of depression in Australia and elsewhere. If the findings are positive, we expect that this research will consolidate the evidence base to guide the decision to fund MBCT and to seek to promote its availability to those who have experienced at least 3 episodes of depression.

The specular fractions of the image pixels can then be computed by using the intensity ratio. For textured surfaces, image pixels are classified into clusters by constructing a pseudo-chromaticity space, and the intensity ratio of each cluster is robustly estimated. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed method works in a pixel-wise manner, without specular pixel identification and any local interaction.

On the other hand, innkeeping as a business is known for long work hours and limited escape from work due to the blurred physical and temporal boundaries between work and life. Given the paradox, this exploratory study examined the respite experience (an interval of rest and relief from work) of innkeepers and its effect on subjective well-being. The findings from an online survey among 327 innkeepers in the United States reveal that innkeepers lack short-term respites at regular intervals. Engagement in active and high-effort social or hobby-based respite activities is found to be a primary pathway to an effective respite experience in the absence of psychological detachment from work. The results show that respite experience has a significant effect on an innkeeper’s subjective well-being after controlling for job demands, entrepreneurial motivation, and financial performance of the inn. This research has also identified three clusters of innkeepers (lifestyle innkeepers, seasonal innkeepers, and career innkeepers) based on their respite characteristics and other related operational and individual variables.

1006,"Sherrill, J. T. and M. Kovacs (2002"," ""Nonsomatic treatment of depression."" Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America 11(3","There is solid evidence that active and goal-oriented cognitive-behavioral or relationship-focused therapies are generally superior to more generic therapies or to no treatment for clinically diagnosed and for undiagnosed but symptomatic youths. Between 50% to 87% of diagnosed youths who received a targeted treatment had recovered from their depressive episodes, in comparison to 21% to 75% of those who received some other generic therapy and 5% to 48% of wait-listed youths. The cognitive behavioral and relationship-oriented interventions that were tested tended to be even more successful in reducing depressive symptoms in school-based samples, possibly because the participants in the school-based studies may have been less disturbed than the clinically diagnosed cases. Although the targeted treatments generally yielded better results than the comparison conditions, the targeted interventions seem to be similarly successful in ameliorating depression. Determining which psychosocial therapy works best for a given depressed youngster remains problematic. As noted in recent reviews [30,46,47], little attention has been devoted to which interventions, or parts of an intervention, are likely to be effective with children with various characteristics. This issue acquires added importance because in some diagnosed samples half or more of the treated participants were still in a depressive episode at the end of the trial. Likewise, in intervention studies involving symptomatic, school-based youngsters, not all children improved, and gains were not uniform across domains of functioning (e.g., severity of depression, self-esteem, global functioning). Possibly, for some of the nonresponders, the participant's characteristics and relevant problems and the target interventions were mismatched. For example, a depressed youth with a long history of highly dysfunctional relationships may not respond optimally to a therapy focusing on negative cognitions; alternatively, interpersonal therapy may not be the most effective treatment for a youth dispositionally inclined to negative ruminations about the self and for whom relationship issues are not the most relevant. Empiric information about the relationship between the underlying processes presumed to account for the onset and maintenance of depression and recovery from depression is limited. Few studies of youths provide direct evidence tht cognitive-behavioral interventions change depressogenic cognitions, explanatory style, and pleasent events, among others, that relationship-focused approaches predictably alter relevant interpersonal processes, or that improvements in these domains relate to overall depression outcomes. Admittedly, the designs of extent studies typically preclude conclusions about the relationship between changes in target processes and improvement in depression or about treatment specificity. More compelling evidence linking changes in targeted mechanisms to decreases in depressive symptoms comes from a controlled prevention trial involving 10- to 13-year-olds that used cognitive restructuring, social problem-solving, or a combination intervention [48]. According to the results, changes in explanatory style were related to decreased depression and accounted for a significant portion of the variance in changes in depression even after controlling for treatment assignment. Further research along such lines may help identify which treatment may be most effective for a patient with a given set of characteristics. To improve patients' response rates to specific treatments, it also would be helpful to understand better the impact of other attributes, such as psychiatric comorbidity, and contextual factors, such as parental psychopathology, on the process of recovery. With few exceptions [25], however, such variable have not yet received sufficient attention. Recent reviews also have noted that researchers typically use multi-component interventions in treatmenttrials [46,47]. This design an make it difficult to identify which particular treatment ingredient is instrum ntal in general or among children with specific characteristics. Thus, empiric initiatives also are needed to determine the active ingredients of experimental therapies for depressed youths. Existing models include component-analysis or dismantling studies of multi-faceted treatments for depressed adults [49,50]. Once the improtant prognostic factors and active ingredients of therapies have been identified, it will be possible to conduct studies in which children are either ""matched"" or ""mismatched"" to treatment conditions. To achieve meaningful results and to enroll sufficient numbers of youths, collaborative, multisite efforts may be required. What treatment should be endorsed for depressed youths from the perspective of health services policy? When the criteria of the Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures [1] are applied broadly, both cognitive behavioral and interpersonally oriented therapies can be deemed efficacious. Both approaches have been tested in different samples by two independent teams and thus may be regarded as well-established treatments for depression in youths. If the criteria are applied more stringently, so that exactly the same intervention is tested independently by two or more research teams, interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy would be regarded as ""probably efficacious"". Namely, the two trials of interpersonal therapy apparently used somewhat different versions because of cultural differences in the samples. The complete CWD course has been tested and the results replicated only by its originators [20,21]. Other trials of cognitive behavioral therapy entail various different study-specific approaches and consequently cannot serve as replications [46,47]. A next step in psychotherapy research might therefore involve further independent replication of standardized, previously studies therapies. In their landmark meta-analytic study of the efficacy of psychotherapy for adults, Smith et al [51] concluded that all psychotherapies are about equally beneficial and that distinctions among them, although ""cherished by those who draw them ... make no important differences: (p. 186). Likewise, the various psychotherapies for depresed youths that have been examined seem to produce similar rates of improvement ( or alternatively, similar limits in efficacy) across the tested therapies and the scant data regarding meaningful prognostic factors might indicate that at present it does not matter what type of brief, goal-oriented nonsomatic therapy is used to treat pediatric depression. Alternatively, one might conclude that patients who fail to respond may have been mismatched to a therapy that was not focused on their primary depression-related deficits. Thus, clinicians who treat depressed children and adolescents are faced with substantial challenges, and to date, results of controlled psychotherapy trials with depressed youths offer limited guidance regarding choice of treatment. Nonetheless, some general guidelines can be culled from the available data. For example, interventions of elements of therapies that are structured and directed towards cognitive, behavioral or relationship issues show promise for the treatment of juvenile depression. It also appears that group interventions may be used as profitably as the more traditional individual therapy formats. And although parental participation in empiric treatment trials of pediatric depression has been limited to either separate parent groups as an adjunct [20,21 or family therapy [7], it can be argued that for various practical and clinical reasons [30] direct involvement of parents may be a wise choice. Parents may be critical to the success of interventions with depressed children and should be regarded as potential important agents of change.",0,1006

This review addresses the literature on the possible pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this disorder.RECENT FINDINGSAtypical presentations of VKH disease, as well as those associated with interferon-alpha therapy, have been reported. Most reports suggest an association with autoimmunity. The diagnostic criteria were revised by the International Workshop on VKH in 1999, allowing for the presence of different ocular findings in the early and late stages of the disease. New techniques have also been developed to aid in the rapid diagnosis of VKH disease and evaluation of treatment. Different routes of administration of corticosteroid and adjuvant therapy were tried, with positive results.SUMMARYAlthough the pathogenesis of VKH disease is uncertain and antigen-specific treatment strategies have not yet been developed, reports increasingly suggest an autoimmune nature for uveomeningoencephalitides. Currently, systemic corticosteroid therapy remains the standard initial treatment. Different routes of administration are used to reduce the frequency of side effects of systemic corticosteroids, and there are various adjuvant therapies. With the aid of modern equipment, early diagnosis and prompt and appropriate treatment, resulting in better visual outcomes, can be anticipated.

PLoS computational biology 7(6","Understanding the relationship between topology and dynamics of transcriptional regulatory networks in mammalian cells is essential to elucidate the biology of complex regulatory and signaling pathways. Here, we characterised, via a synthetic biology approach, a transcriptional positive feedback loop (PFL) by generating a clonal population of mammalian cells (CHO) carrying a stable integration of the construct. The PFL network consists of the Tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA), whose expression is regulated by a tTA responsive promoter (CMV-TET), thus giving rise to a positive feedback. The same CMV-TET promoter drives also the expression of a destabilised yellow fluorescent protein (d2EYFP), thus the dynamic behaviour can be followed by time-lapse microscopy. The PFL network was compared to an engineered version of the network lacking the positive feedback loop (NOPFL), by expressing the tTA mRNA from a constitutive promoter. Doxycycline was used to repress tTA activation (switch off), and the resulting changes in fluorescence intensity for both the PFL and NOPFL networks were followed for up to 43 h. We observed a striking difference in the dynamics of the PFL and NOPFL networks. Using non-linear dynamical models, able to recapitulate experimental observations, we demonstrated a link between network topology and network dynamics. Namely, transcriptional positive autoregulation can significantly slow down the ""switch off"" times, as compared to the non-autoregulated system. Doxycycline concentration can modulate the response times of the PFL, whereas the NOPFL always switches off with the same dynamics. Moreover, the PFL can exhibit bistability for a range of Doxycycline concentrations. Since the PFL motif is often found in naturally occurring transcriptional and signaling pathways, we believe our work can be instrumental to characterise their behaviour.",0,1014

In this work, we predict that Asp and Lys residues at the protein rim change their protonation state upon penetration to the lipid environment. Free energies of protein insertion in the membrane for different penetration depths were estimated using the Poisson-Boltzmann/solvent-accessible surface area (PB/SASA) model. The results show that rectification and reversal potentials are very sensitive to the relative position of channel in the membrane, which in turn contributes to alternative protonation states of lipid-penetrating ionizable groups. The prediction of channel position based on the matching of calculated rectification with experimentally determined rectification is in good agreement with recent neutron reflection experiments.

However due to the complex and varying nature of the nonlinear phenomena created by the interaction between the exciting signal and the damage, there are many variables at play which can lead to success or failure of the method. While experiments lead to the establishment of the method to be used as a damage detection technique, numerical simulations can help to explain the various phenomena associated with nonlinearity. This work presents a quick approach to model the nonlinear behavior caused by closed delaminations. The model is validated with a previously available approach for nonlinear vibrations modeling and a comparison is made between the two. The local nature of the nonlinearity enables to map out the area of damage in the structure. Additionally, a few parametric studies are performed to study the effect of various parameters related to the nonlinear phenomenon.",0,1018

Nanotechnology 29(24","This work reports a detailed study of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composite as an excellent electromagnetic (EM) interference shielding material in GHz range. A rGO-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composite was synthesized using a facile, one step, and modified solvothermal method with the reaction of FeCl3, ethylenediamine and graphite oxide powder in the presence of ethylene glycol. Various structural, microstructural and optical characterization tools were used to determine its synthesis and various properties. Dielectric, magnetic and EM shielding parameters were also evaluated to estimate its performance as a shielding material for EM waves. X-ray diffraction patterns have provided information about the structural and crystallographic properties of the as-synthesized material. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs revealed the information regarding the exfoliation of graphite into rGO. Well-dispersed Fe3O4 nanoparticles over the surface of the graphene can easily be seen by employing transmission electron microscopy. For comparison, rGO nanosheets and Fe3O4 nanoparticles have also been synthesized and characterized in a similar fashion. A plot of the dielectric and magnetic characterizations provides some useful information related to various losses and the relaxation process. Shielding effectiveness due to reflection (SER), shielding effectiveness due to absorption (SEA), and total shielding effectiveness (SET) were also plotted against frequency over a broad range (8-12 GHz). A significant change in all parameters (SEA value from 5 dB to 35 dB for Fe3O4 nanoparticles to rGO-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composite) was found. An actual shielding effectiveness (SET) up to 55 dB was found in the rGO-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composite. These graphs give glimpses of how significantly this material shows shielding effectiveness over a broad range of frequency.",0,1019

ACS applied materials & interfaces 9(24","Considering the high toxicity and widespread availability of fluoride ions in different environmental matrices, it is imperative to design a probe for its detection. In view of this, a selective fluorescent on-off-on probe based on carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and Eu3+ has been designed. We have synthesized water-soluble carboxylic acid-functionalized CQDs and monitored their interaction with Eu3+. Luminescence quenching in the CQD emission was observed (switch-off) on adding Eu3+ ions. We investigate the reason for this luminescence quenching using time-resolved emission and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies and observed that both electron transfer from CQDs to Eu3+ and aggregation of CQDs are responsible for the luminescence quenching. ζ-Potential and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies confirm Eu3+ binding with the COOH groups on CQD surface. Interestingly, luminescence regains after the addition of fluoride ions to the CQDs/Eu3+ system (switch-on). This has been assigned to the removal of Eu3+ from the CQD surface due to the formation of EuF3 and is confirmed by X-ray diffraction and HRTEM measurements. The sensitivity of the probe was tested by carrying out experiments with other competing ions and was found to be selective for fluoride ions. Experiments with variable concentrations of fluoride ions suggest that the working range of the probe is 1-25 ppm. The probe has been successfully tested for the detection of fluoride ions in a toothpaste sample and the results were compared to those of ion chromatography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report based on CQDs and Eu3+ for the detection of fluoride ions, wherein a clear mechanism of the detection has been demonstrated, which, in turn, will help to develop better detection methods. The suggested probe is green, economical, rapid, efficient, and, most importantly, selective and can be used for the detection of fluoride ions in real environmental samples.",0,1020

Moreover, the energy dispersive spectroscopy pattern also revealed the presence of only elemental copper in the copper nanoparticles. The prepared nanoparticles were used for the remediation of a carcinogenic and noxious textile dye, Methylene blue, from aqueous solution. Approximately, 96 % degradation of Methylene blue dye was observed within 135 min using copper nanoparticles.

Current methods for hydrate mitigation are expensive and energy intensive, comprising chemical, thermal, or flow management techniques. In this paper, we present an alternate approach of using functionalized coatings to reduce hydrate adhesion to surfaces, ideally to a low enough level that hydrodynamic shear stresses can detach deposits and prevent plug formation. Systematic and quantitative studies of hydrate adhesion on smooth substrates with varying solid surface energies reveal a linear trend between hydrate adhesion strength and the practical work of adhesion (γ(total)[1 + cos θ(rec)]) of a suitable probe liquid, that is, one with similar surface energy properties to those of the hydrate. A reduction in hydrate adhesion strength by more than a factor of four when compared to bare steel is achieved on surfaces characterized by low Lewis acid, Lewis base, and van der Waals contributions to surface free energy such that the practical work of adhesion is minimized. These fundamental studies provide a framework for the development of hydrate-phobic surfaces, and could lead to passive enhancement of flow assurance and prevention of blockages in deep-sea oil and gas operations.",0,1023

Supervision conditions received 5 weekly supervision sessions at their sites using actors as standard patients. Sessions with clients were rated for MI skill with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding System pre-workshop and 1, 8, and 20 weeks post-workshop. Mixed-effects linear models were used to test training condition on MI skill at 8 and 20 weeks.RESULTSTCS scored better than workshop on the MITI for spirit (mean difference = 0.76; p < .0001; d = 1.01) and empathy (mean difference = 0.68; p < .001; d = 0.74).

In the absence of such evidence, the development of assisted support must be based on the opinions and experience of professionals with knowledge of the relevant field. The purpose of this research project is to explore how the nominal group technique can be used to establish consensus by analysing how it supported the development of structured, knowledge-based, electronic health records for preventive child health examinations in Danish general practice.METHODSWe convened an expert panel of five general practitioners with a special interest in the preventive child health examinations. We introduced the panel to the nominal group technique, a well-established, structured, multistep, facilitated, group meeting technique used to generate consensus. The panel used the technique to agree on the key clinical and socioeconomic themes to include in new electronic records for the seven preventive child health examinations in Denmark. The panel met three times over a four-month period between 2013 and 2014 and their meetings lasted between two-and-a-half and five hours.RESULTS1) The structured and stepwise process of the nominal group technique supported our expert panel's focus as well as their equal opportunities to speak. 2) The method's flexibility enabled participants to work as a group and in pairs to discuss and refine thematic classifications. 3) Serial meetings supported continual evaluation, critical reflection, and knowledge searches, enabling our panel to produce a template that could be adapted for all seven preventive child health examinations.CONCLUSIONThe nominal group technique proved to be a useful method for reaching consensus by identifying key quality markers for use in daily clinical practice.

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the performance of a new contact-free triggering method developed with the aim to eventually replace conventional methods in non-cardiac imaging applications. In this study, the method's performance is evaluated in the context of 7 Tesla non-enhanced angiography of the lower extremities.METHODSOur main contribution is a basic algorithm capable of estimating in real-time the phase of the cardiac cycle from reflection photoplethysmography signals obtained from skin color variations of the forehead recorded with a video camera. Instead of finding the algorithm's parameters heuristically, they were optimized using videos of the forehead as well as electrocardiography and pulse oximetry signals that were recorded from eight healthy volunteers in and outside the scanner, with and without active radio frequency and gradient coils. Based on the video characteristics, synthetic signals were generated and the ""best available"" values of an objective function were determined using mathematical optimization. The performance of the proposed method with optimized algorithm parameters was evaluated by applying it to the recorded videos and comparing the computed triggers to those of contact-based methods. Additionally, the method was evaluated by using its triggers for acquiring images from a healthy volunteer and comparing the result to images obtained using pulse oximetry triggering.RESULTSDuring evaluation of the videos recorded inside the bore with active radio frequency and gradient coils, the pulse oximeter triggers were labeled in 62.5% as ""potentially usable"" for cardiac triggering, the electrocardiography triggers in 12.5%, and the proposed method's triggers in 62.5%. Evaluation of the angiography images demonstrated that under appropriate conditions the method is feasible to produce an image quality comparable to pulse oximetry.CONCLUSIONWe conclude that cardiac triggering using the proposed method is technically feasible.

B 114(11","Triplet, photo-oxidized and other photoinduced, long-lived states of fluorophores are sensitive to the local environment and thus attractive for microenvironmental imaging purposes. In this work, we introduce an approach where these states are monitored in a total internal reflection (TIR) fluorescence microscope, via the characteristic variations of the time-averaged fluorescence occurring in response to different excitation modulation schemes. The surface-confined TIR excitation field generates a signal from the fluorescent molecules close to the glass surface. Thereby, a high selectivity and low background noise is obtained, and in combination with low duty cycles of excitation, the overall photodegradation of the fluorescent molecules of the sample can be kept low. To verify the approach, the kinetics of the triplet and radical states of the dye Rhodamine 110 were imaged and analyzed in aqueous solutions at different concentrations of dissolved oxygen and of the reducing agent ascorbic acid. The experimental results were compared to data from corresponding fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements and simulations based on finite element analysis. The approach was found to accurately determine relative populations and dynamics of triplet and photo-oxidized states, overcoming passage time limitations seen in FCS measurements. The method circumvents the need for time resolution in the fluorescence detection, allowing simultaneous readout over the whole surface area subject to excitation. It can be applied over a broad range of concentrations and does not require a strong fluorescence brightness of the sample molecules. Given the sensitivity of the triplet and photo-oxidized states to oxygen concentrations and not the least to local redox environments, we expect the approach to become an attractive tool for imaging cell metabolism.",0,1031

Fertility concerns for the future and recovery from surgical or medical treatment may instead become the focus of care. The objective of this study was to gain insight into women's experience of Ectopic pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative semi-structured interview format was utilised. Seven women who had experienced an Ectopic pregnancy in a large tertiary-level Irish maternity hospital were interviewed. This sample was recruited purposively ensuring inclusion of women whose treatment included expectant, medical or surgical management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was employed as the analytic strategy as it has an ideographic approach which allows us to gain insight into the women's experiences of Ectopic pregnancy. RESULTS: Key findings were the importance of clear information on treatment options, the diagnostic scan was highlighted as important as it helped the women emotionally detach from the pregnancy. Lack of bereavement counselling and satisfactory completion of outpatient care hindered closure and recovery for these women. There was increased apprehension about fertility and women reported feeling reluctant to conceive again. Women reported difficulty coming to terms with their diagnosis which in turn impacted their recovery and illustrated women's reservations to embark on future pregnancies.

Unlike other countries, the immunization programme is not compulsory in the UK, and the decision whether to immunize a child or not is parental.OBJECTIVEThe objective of this study was to explore the decision-making process of parents who have chosen not to have their children immunized.METHODSThis was a qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews with parents either in their own homes or at their places of work. The study was set in an inner city area with a high level of deprivation. The district immunization co-ordinator and health visitors within the area referred parents to the researcher. Parents subsequently were selected using purposive maximum variation sampling. Data were analysed using consistent and systematic review. An initial coding frame that was derived from the first few transcripts was revised and developed through its application to subsequent transcripts. The final stage of analysis involved comparing the data using the revised coding frame for drawing conclusions and verification.RESULTSInterviews were completed with 13 parents. Parents discussed their perceptions of childhood diseases and immunization, and the risk-benefit analysis that occurred between the two. All parents identified the risk of side effects as a reason for choosing not to immunize. A proposed model of the decision-making process that represented the experiences of the parents in this study is presented. In response to the question of immunization, three actions were described by parents: a routine response, an emotional response and delaying the decision by entering a questioning stage followed by a cyclical process of seeking and evaluating information. Key to this model was a stage of reflection that most parents described irrespective of their initial action in response to the question of immunization. Parents also discussed their responsibilities in terms of the consequences of their decisions. Health professionals were perceived as providing unbalanced information that was an obstacle in decision making.CONCLUSIONThe parents included in this study had chosen not to immunize at least one of their children. Most parents felt they had made an informed decision, based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of immunization and an acceptance of responsibility for that decision. Health professionals were not perceived as providers of balanced information. It is therefore important that parents have easy access to accurate information concerning the pros and cons of treatment, and have the opportunity to discuss their concerns with health professionals.",0,1035

Phys Biol 16(1","The microtubule-bound motors kinesin and dynein differ in many respects, a striking difference being that while kinesin is known to function mostly alone, dynein operates in large groups, much like myosinV in actin. Optical tweezer experiments in vitro have shown that the mean detachment time of a bead attached to [Formula: see text] kinesins under stall conditions is a slowly decreasing function of [Formula: see text], while for dyneins, the time increases almost linearly with [Formula: see text]. This makes dynein a team worker, capable of producing and sustaining a large collective force without detaching. We characterize this phenomenon as 'temporal cooperativity' under load. In general, it is unclear which biophysical properties of a single motor determine whether it behaves cooperatively or not in a group. Our theoretical analysis shows that this is determined by two dimensionless parameters: (i) the ratio of single molecule, load-independent detachment and attachment rates and (ii) the ratio of the applied force per motor to the detachment force of a single motor. We show that the attachment-detachment dynamics of a motor assembly may be mapped to the motion of a hypothetical, overdamped Brownian particle in an effective potential, the form of which depends on the load-dependence of binding and unbinding rate of the motor. In this picture, the total number [Formula: see text] of motors is proportional to the inverse temperature and cooperative behaviour arises from the trapping of the particle in the minima of the potential, when present. In the latter case, application of results from Kramers' theory predicts that the mean time of escape of the particle, equivalent to the mean detachment time of the bead under stall, increases exponentially with the number of motors, indicating cooperative behaviour. If the potential does not have minima, the detachment time depends only weakly on [Formula: see text], which suggests non-cooperative behaviour. In the large [Formula: see text] limit, the emergence of cooperative behaviour is shown to be similar to a continuous phase transition.",0,1036

Botryosphaeria dieback is associated with Botryosphaeriaceae. In order to develop effective strategies against Botryosphaeria dieback, we investigated the molecular basis of grapevine interactions with a virulent species, Neofusicoccum parvum, and a weak pathogen, Diplodia seriata. We investigated defenses induced by purified secreted fungal proteins within suspension cells of Vitis (Vitis rupestris and Vitis vinifera cv. Gewurztraminer) with putative different susceptibility to Botryosphaeria dieback. Our results show that Vitis cells are able to detect secreted proteins produced by Botryosphaeriaceae, resulting in a rapid alkalinization of the extracellular medium and the production of reactive oxygen species. Concerning early defense responses, N. parvum proteins induced a more intense response compared to D. seriata. Early and late defense responses, i.e., extracellular medium alkalinization, cell death, and expression of PR defense genes were stronger in V. rupestris compared to V. vinifera, except for stilbene production. Secreted Botryosphaeriaceae proteins triggered a high accumulation of delta-viniferin in V. vinifera suspension cells. Artificial inoculation assays on detached canes with N. parvum and D. seriata showed that the development of necrosis is reduced in V. rupestris compared to V. vinifera cv. Gewurztraminer. This may be related to a more efficient induction of defense responses in V. rupestris, although not sufficient to completely inhibit fungal colonization.

Accurate modelling of photon interactions with crystal surfaces is essential in optical simulations, but the existing UNIFIED model in GATE is often inaccurate, especially for rough surfaces. Previously a new approach for modelling surface reflections based on measured surfaces was validated using custom Monte Carlo code. In this work, the LUT Davis model is implemented and validated in GATE and GEANT4, and is made accessible for all users in the nuclear imaging research community. Look-up-tables (LUTs) from various crystal surfaces are calculated based on measured surfaces obtained by atomic force microscopy. The LUTs include photon reflection probabilities and directions depending on incidence angle. We provide LUTs for rough and polished surfaces with different reflectors and coupling media. Validation parameters include light output measured at different depths of interaction in the crystal and photon track lengths, as both parameters are strongly dependent on reflector characteristics and distinguish between models. Results from the GATE/GEANT4 beta version are compared to those from our custom code and experimental data, as well as the UNIFIED model. GATE simulations with the LUT Davis model show average variations in light output of  <2% from the custom code and excellent agreement for track lengths with R 2  >  0.99. Experimental data agree within 9% for relative light output. The new model also simplifies surface definition, as no complex input parameters are needed. The LUT Davis model makes optical simulations for nuclear imaging detectors much more precise, especially for studies with rough crystal surfaces. It will be available in GATE V8.0.",0,1040

The properties that make SV40 a successful virus make it an attractive candidate for use as a gene delivery vehicle: high titer replication, infectivity for almost all nucleated cell types whether the cells are dividing or resting, potential for integration into cellular DNA, a peculiar pathway for entering cells that bypasses the cells' antigen processing apparatus, very high stability, and the apparent ability to activate expression of its own capsid genes in trans. Exploiting these and other characteristics of wild type (wt) SV40, increasing numbers of laboratories are studying recombinant (r) SV40-derived vectors. Among the uses to which these vectors have been applied are: delivering therapy to inhibit HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other viruses; correction of inherited hepatic and other protein deficiencies; immunizing against lentiviral and other antigens; treatment of inherited and acquired diseases of the central nervous system; protecting the lung and other organs from free radical-induced injury; and many others. The effectiveness of these vectors is a reflection of the adaptive evolution that produced their parent virus, wt SV40.

European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 257(8","The paper argues for a reconceptualization of ruminative coping with the death of a loved one as an avoidant rather than a confrontational strategy. Ruminative coping has been characterized within the bereavement field as persistent, repetitive and passive focus on negative emotions and symptoms. It has been theoretically described and empirically shown to be a maladaptive process, being conceptually related to complicated/chronic/prolonged grief. Furthermore, it has been contrasted with denial and suppression processes--which, too, have been understood to be maladaptive and associated with major complications following bereavement. Here evidence is reviewed and the case made that rumination is not an opposite form of coping from suppression or denial, but that it is a similar phenomenon to these, and different from the types of confrontation that take place in so-called 'grief work'. Implications with respect to intervention for complicated grief are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1043

Integrative and comparative biology 47(4","Integrative movement neuroscience involves blending ""inside-out"" and ""outside-in"" approaches in the study of posture and movement. The former is characterized by determining the properties of single cells within the central nervous system (CNS) and then ascertaining how these properties influence the operation of CNS microcircuits, single reflexes, groups of reflexes, and generators of central pattern. This information is then used to theorize about CNS control of overt motor behavior. In contrast, the outside-in approach begins with analysis of the biomechanics of posture and movement and then uses this information to theorize how the mechanics are solved by the CNS and its pathways, circuitry, and even single cells. Studies conducted in the 1960s on CNS circuitry generating locomotor patterns in several invertebrate and vertebrate species, together with work on the treadmill locomotion of brain-stimulated decerebrate cats, led to a subsequent convergence of inside-out and outside-in understanding of the neural control of locomotion in invertebrates, nonmammalian vertebrates, and mammalian vertebrates, even including humans. This convergence of integrative and comparative approaches has been facilitated by modeling and simulation studies. These developments have important implications for doctoral and postdoctoral training programs in movement neuroscience. They can profit greatly by use of a multidisciplinary university-wide faculty who place a strong emphasis on integrative and comparative biology. Furthermore, the next generation of movement neuroscientists will require more familiarity with modeling and simulation than are being provided in most current training programs. To achieve the above, it will be advantageous if university culture and structure truly champion university-wide interdisciplinary research.",0,1044

Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry 41(4","Child and adolescent mental health services in Europe are confronted with children with increasingly diverse socio-cultural backgrounds. Clinicians encounter cultural environments of hyperdiversity in terms of languages and countries of origin, growing diversity within groups, and accelerated change with regards to social and administrational situations (Hannah, in: DelVecchio Good et al. (eds) Shattering culture: American medicine responds to cultural diversity, Russel Sage Foundation, New York, 2011). Children and families who live in these complex constellations face multiple vulnerabilizing factors related to overlapping or intersecting social identities (Crenshaw in Univ Chic Leg Forum 140:139-167, 1989). Mobilizing existing resources in terms of social and family support, and encouraging creative strategies of interculturation in therapeutic work (Denoux, in: Blomart and Krewer (eds) Perspectives de l'interculturel, L'Harmattan, Paris, 1994) may be helpful in order to enhance resilience. Drawing from experiences in the context of French transcultural and intercultural psychiatry, and inspired by the Mc Gill Cultural Consultation in Child Psychiatry, we developed an innovative model, the Intercultural Consultation Service (ICS). This consultation proposes short term interventions to children and families with complex migration experiences. It has been implemented into a local public health care structure in Toulouse, the Medical and Psychological Centre la Grave. The innovation includes the creation of a specific setting for short term therapeutic interventions and team training via shared case discussions. Our objectives are (a) to improve outcomes of mental health care for the children through a better understanding of the child's family context (exploration of family dynamics and their relatedness to complex migration histories), (b) to enhance intercultural competencies in professionals via shared case discussions, and, (c) to improve the therapeutic relationship between children and professionals on the basis of the work with the family and the dialogue with the team. In our paper, we present the rationale and functioning of the ICS and illustrate our work with a case study. The presentation of the case uses the Mc Gill B-version of the Cultural Formulation, combined with a relational and process oriented reflection on the intercultural dynamics that unfold during the encounter with a family.",0,1045

An integrating metaphor for the emerging primary (health","BACKGROUNDMetaphors are central to the human understanding of complex issues; through the immediate associations they evoke and frame problems and suggest solutions. Our suggestion of Music in the Park as a metaphor for health systems reform brings to the forefront the environmentally diverse but bounded spaces of health services that offer a variety of attractors within their confines, while pushing into the background organizational and economic concerns.REFLECTIONSParks, like health services, are embedded in their local landscape, serving their communities, but most importantly parks are public spaces, publically funded, ideally offering universal access and equity and to be shared by all who want to go there. Music, like health, is tangible, technical and scientific, yet ultimately experiential and based on meaning. While it encompasses a wide range of styles and approaches, music making requires as its most important skill active listening which brings with it to be 'in the moment', to take personal risks and to draw energy and inspiration from the participants. Hence 'audiences' are equally active participants because music only has meaning if it internally resonates with the listener and only can exist in what is a co-constructed experience.CONCLUSIONSMusic in the Park is a metaphor for primary health care systems based on shared values of experts and unique local communities. Health professionals are players in this arena, who develop and practise the full range of their skills in response to individual and community needs and preferences. Their leadership works through inspiration and empowerment, making patients 'co-producers' of their own health and 'co-shapers' of their health services.",0,1046

Thus, a mathematical model to quantitatively describe such a granulation process is highly desired. In this work, by taking into account all of key steps including biomass growth, increase in particle size and density, detachment, breakage and sedimentation, an one-dimensional mathematic model was developed to simulate the granulation process of activated sludge in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Discretization methodology was applied by dividing operational time, sedimentation process, size fractions and slices into discretized calculation elements. Model verification and prediction for aerobic granulation process were conducted under four different conditions. Four parameters indicative of granulation progression, including mean radius, biomass discharge ratio, total number, and bioparticle size distribution, were predicted well with the model. An optimum controlling strategy, automatically adjusted of settling time, was also proposed based on this model. Moreover, aerobic granules with a density higher than 120 g VSS/L and radius in a range of 0.4-1.0 mm were predicted to have both high settling velocity and substrate utilization rate, and the corresponding optimum operating conditions were be determined. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed model is appropriate for simulating the formation of aerobic granules in SBRs.

These concepts expand the test to work in more general situations where fringe illumination is not practical. Experimental results show that the test can be implemented without complex calibration for many applications by taking the geometric advantage of working near the center curvature of the test part. The results also show that the test has a large dynamic range, can achieve measurement accuracy comparable with interferometric methods, and can provide a good complement to interferometric tests in certain circumstances. A variation of this method is also useful for measuring refractive optics and optical systems.

Current biology : CB 27(24","Hominins have been making tools for over three million years [1], yet the earliest known hooked tools appeared as recently as 90,000 years ago [2]. Hook innovation is likely to have boosted our ancestors' hunting and fishing efficiency [3], marking a major transition in human technological evolution. The New Caledonian crow is the only non-human animal known to craft hooks in the wild [4, 5]. Crows manufacture hooked stick tools in a multi-stage process, involving the detachment of a branch from suitable vegetation; ""sculpting"" of a terminal hook from the nodal joint; and often additional adjustments, such as length trimming, shaft bending, and bark stripping [4, 6, 7]. Although tools made by a given population share key design features [4, 6, 8], they vary appreciably in overall shape and hook dimensions. Using wild-caught, temporarily captive crows, we experimentally investigated causes and consequences of variation in hook-tool morphology. We found that bird age, manufacture method, and raw-material properties influenced tool morphology, and that hook geometry in turn affected crows' foraging efficiency. Specifically, hook depth varied with both detachment technique and plant rigidity, and deeper hooks enabled faster prey extraction in the provided tasks. Older crows manufactured tools of distinctive shape, with pronounced shaft curvature and hooks of intermediate depth. Future work should explore the interactive effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on tool production and deployment. Our study provides a quantitative assessment of the drivers and functional significance of tool shape variation in a non-human animal, affording valuable comparative insights into early hominin tool crafting [9].",0,1051

Although the long-term clinical, functional and induced sputum sequelae have been examined in workers removed from exposure, the long-term pathological outcomes are unknown.OBJECTIVEWe aimed to investigate whether airway inflammation and remodelling were present in bronchial biopsies of subjects with prior OA but without evidence of persisting asthma at a mean interval of 14 years after cessation of exposure.METHODSTen clinically and functionally asymptomatic subjects with a prior diagnosis of OA were recruited and underwent bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsy. Comparisons were made with biopsies from normal control subjects. Epithelial detachment, epithelial metaplasia, mucous gland and airway smooth muscle (ASM) areas as well as the distance between the epithelium and ASM were measured by image analysis. The amount of collagen present was assessed by van Gieson staining. The numbers of TGF-beta1- and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)-positive cells were evaluated by specific immunostaining.RESULTSStatistically significant increases were found in the numbers of TGF-beta1- and ECP-positive cells and in the amount of subepithelial fibrosis present in the biopsies of subjects with prior OA compared with control biopsies. The distance between the epithelium and ASM was significantly reduced in the OA group.

Target components were separated under isothermal conditions (30 °C) on micro-TLC plates (RP18WF254S) using n-hexane as the mobile phase. The principle of described analytical protocol is based on sensitive measurement of the temperature contrast generated within TLC stationary phase and fullerenes spots after white light pulse excitation. It has been demonstrated that observed temperature contrast is mainly driven by the optical properties of fullerenes (UV-vis absorption spectra). Contrary to the commonly applied optical reflection or transmission techniques the proposed thermovision method involves dissipated light. The results of presented experimental work have revealed that both types of quantitative measurements provide similar outcome despite the key differences in the signal origin. However, it has been found that thermovision method was characterized by smaller value of LOD, particularly for C60 molecule. We demonstrated that application of correlation technique to post-acquisition analysis of the sequence of temperature contrast images significantly increase detection limits of fullerenes, even in comparison to fluorescence quenching detection mode.

Four aneurysms were surgically removed between 6 months and 3 years following treatment. One aneurysm removed at 8 days and another at 6 months were treated with bioactive (Matrix) coils; the other 16 with bare platinum (Guglielmi detachable coils; GDCs). All specimens were embedded in plastic, stained with hematoxilin-eosin and elastin and examined by light microscopy.RESULTSAll specimens removed within 3 weeks demonstrated intra-aneurysmal thrombus, without signs of organization or fibrotic tissue formation over the neck regardless of the type of coils used. In the GDC-treated aneurysms, evidence of early thrombus organization was observed within 2-3 months, and completed yet imperfect fibrocellular reaction together with residual thrombus at 2-3 years.

Conceptually, the four key concepts can serve as a useful guide for nurses to understand their own and other nurses' responses to caring for suicidal patients in various settings. Methodologically, the Critical Interpretive Synthesis approach moved a small body of knowledge that varied in quality measures beyond an aggregate understanding.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEUnderstanding nurses' responses to suicide and suicidal patients may guide nurses to care for suicidal patients in ways that facilitate suicide prevention and recovery, thus addressing the urgent work of suicide prevention in the world.",0,1062

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy 118: 82-93.","In this work, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on molecular structure, vibrational spectra and NBO analysis of the potential nonlinear optical (NLO) material anilinium trichloroacetate. The FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of the compound have been recorded together between 4000-80 cm(-1) and 3600-80 cm(-1) regions, respectively. The compound crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group of monoclinic system. The optimized molecular structure, vibrational wavenumbers, IR intensities and Raman activities have been calculated by using density functional method (B3LYP) with 6-311++G(d,p) as higher basis set. The obtained vibrational wavenumbers and optimized geometric parameters were seen to be in good agreement with the experimental data. DSC measurements on powder samples do not indicate clearly on the occurrence of phase transitions in the temperature 113-293 K. The Kurtz and Perry powder reflection technique appeared to be very effective in studies of second-order nonlinear optical properties of the molecule. The non-linear optical properties are also addressed theoretically. The predicted NLO properties of the title compound are much greater than ones of urea. In addition, DFT calculations of the title compound, molecular electrostatic potential, frontier orbitals and thermodynamic properties were also performed at 6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. For title crystal the SHG efficiency was estimated by Kurtz-Perry method to be d(eff)=0.70 d(eff) (KDP).",0,1063

We measured the Young's modulus of few-layer black phosphorus to be 58.6 ± 11.7 and 27.2 ± 4.1 GPa in zigzag and armchair directions. The breaking stress scaled almost linearly with the Young's modulus and was measured to be 4.79 ± 1.43 and 2.31 ± 0.71 GPa in the two directions. We have also observed highly anisotropic transport behavior in black phosphorus and derived the conductance anisotropy to be 63.7%. The test results agreed well with theoretical predictions.

Ultrasonics.","The purpose of this work was to present a new approach that allows the influence of cortical bone on noninvasive measurement of broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) to be corrected. The method, implemented here at 1 MHz makes use of backscattered signal and once refined and clinically confirmed, it would offer an alternative to ionizing radiation based methods, such as DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), radiographic absorptiometry (RA) or single X-ray absorptiometry (SXA), which are clinically approved for assessment of progress of osteoporosis. In addition, as the method employs reflected waves, it might substantially enhance the applicability of BUA - from being suitable to peripheral bones only it would extend this applicability to include such embedded bones as hip and femoral neck. The proposed approach allows the cortical layer parameters used for correction and the corrected value and parameter of the cancellous bone (BUA) to be determined simultaneously from the single (pulse-echo) bone backscattered wave; to the best of the authors' knowledge such approach was not previously reported. The validity of the method was tested using acoustic data obtained from a custom-designed bone-mimicking phantom and a calf femur. The relative error of the attenuation coefficient assessment was determined to be 3.9% and 4.7% for the bone phantom and calf bone specimens, respectively. When the cortical shell influence was not taken into account the corresponding errors were considerably higher 8.3% (artificial bone) and 9.2% (calf femur). As indicated above, once clinically proven, the use of this BUA measurement technique in reflection mode would augment diagnostic power of the attending physician by permitting to include bones, which are not accessible for transmission mode evaluation, e.g. hip, spine, humerus and femoral neck.",0,1065

BMC Pediatr 18(1","BACKGROUND: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare life threatening dermatological disorder characterized by extensive epidermal detachment and erosion of mucous membranes. It is typically a side effect of some medications. Nevirapine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) is one of the frequently used components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Skin rash is its common adverse reaction, usually mild and rarely progressing to TEN. Ophthalmic involvement is common as well but rarely progresses to blindness especially in the pediatric population. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 3 year 5 month old child diagnosed with HIV who developed TEN 8 days after starting a Nevirapine based HAART regimen. Drug withdrawal and supportive treatment alone were the modalities employed to achieve complete re-epithelization of lesions. Patient was lost to follow-up 6 months after being in care and was only seen 3 years later with total loss of vision. CONCLUSION: Blindness, though rare, can be a long-term complication of TEN in children especially with HIV infection. Physicians and patient caregivers should closely monitor these patients, especially during their early stages of treatment amongst others for development of adverse drug reactions. Long-term retention in care is pivotal for identification and prompt management of ocular and other chronic complications, albeit recognizing management challenges in low resourced settings.",0,1067

Prognostic factors for no light perception and for poor vision (visual acuity &lt;3/10) in patients who retained vision after surgical treatment were determined.RESULTSWe observed a different age distribution between male and female ocular trauma (143 patients were men, with a mean age of 46.4 years, while the mean age for women was 70.9 years). Domestic accidents were the most frequent context of trauma (44.4%). However, work accidents constituted the principal context of trauma among men. Initial visual acuity, concomitant adnexa lesion, associated nonocular trauma, and intentionally caused trauma were predictors of no vision at the end of the follow-up. Older age, lens damage, and retinal detachment were predictors of poor vision in patients with retained visual acuity. Vitreous hemorrhage, posterior segment lesion, and simultaneous lesion of anterior and posterior segment anticipated both no vision and poor vision. Isolated anterior segment lesion was associated with vision survival and good vision (≥3/10).CONCLUSIONSThe prognostic factors identified in this study may aid the process of decision-making in 2 crucial moments: at the initial approach and during the follow-up of patients with vision survival after open-globe injuries.",0,1068

However, the correlational findings fail to inform the stigma reduction prospects of manipulating continuum beliefs. All extant experimental work has been executed online. This study examined effects of a laboratory-based continuum intervention on behavioral and self-report measures of psychiatric stigma.METHODSSixty-nine undergraduates believed that they would meet a man with schizophrenia. They then read a bogus scientific article that attested to a categorical view of schizophrenia, a continuum view, or that merely described schizophrenia. Some participants then completed a task that required reflection on their differences from (categorical group) or similarities to (continuum group) the man with schizophrenia. Participants eventually moved to an adjacent room and sat in one of several seats that varied in their proximity to a seat ostensibly occupied by the man with schizophrenia.RESULTSThe continuum intervention decreased self-reported social distance and the categorical intervention increased endorsement of damaging stereotypes. Seat selection was unaffected by our manipulation, but we obtained evidence of significant links to validated stigma measures.LIMITATIONSOur sample was small, and our behavioral stigma measure could be modified to maximize variability in participants' seat selection.CONCLUSIONSThe study offers modest support of the stigma reduction effect of continuum belief intervention. It offers new evidence of the pernicious consequences of interventions that inflate perceptions of the ""otherness"" of individuals with psychiatric problems.

The instrumental parameters and test conditions such as pre-hydration time of pectin disc, contact time, contact force, test speed of probe withdrawal, GI tissue and test medium were also studied. Two parameters derived from texture analysis, namely maximum detachment force (F(max)) and work of adhesion (W(ad)), were used as parameters for comparison of mucoadhesive performance. The results indicated that degree of hydration of pectin disc affected the mucoadhesive properties. The mucoadhesion of pectin increased with the increased contact time and contact force, but not by the increased probe withdrawal speed. Tissue from different parts of GI tract and test medium also influenced the mucoadhesion. Pectins showed a stronger mucoadhesion on large intestinal mucosa than on small intestinal mucosa. The mucoadhesive properties of pectins on gastric mucosa depended on pH of the medium; a higher F(max) and W(ad) in a pH 4.8 medium than a pH 1.2 medium was revealed. Additionally, pectin showed a significantly higher mucoadhesion than carbomer934P in most of the GI mucosa tested. The results also demonstrated that the mucoadhesive performance of pectins largely depended on their characteristics, i.e. higher degree of esterification and molecular weight gave a stronger mucoadhesion.

Low cortisol, dopamine and/or serotonin may be involved in burnout and detachment. Methods: In this double-blind within-subject study, we treated 9 female burnout subjects and 9 controls with 35 mg cortisol and placebo orally. We measured state affect and plasma prolactin, oxytocin, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, and administered an attachment questionnaire. Results: The burnout subjects displayed an extreme distribution of basal prolactin levels, displaying higher or lower levels compared to the controls. The low prolactin burnouts had profoundly low attachment scores and tended to have low oxytocin levels. The high prolactin burnout subjects tended to show cortisol-induced decreased prolactin and fatigue, and increased vigor. Conclusion: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that burnout subjects are either characterized by low serotonergic function or by low dopaminergic function, and that the latter group benefits from cortisol replacement.

This review has thoroughly considered several blocks of unmet needs, which are frequently related to schizophrenic disorders. Those related to health have been the first block to be considered, in which authors have examined the frequent complications and comorbidities found in schizophrenia, such as substance abuse and dual diagnosis. A second block has been devoted to psychosocial and economic needs, especially within the field of recovery of the persistently mentally ill. Within this block, the effects of the current economic difficulties shown in recent literature have been considered as well. Because no patient is static, a third block has reviewed evolving needs according to the clinical staging model. The fourth block has been dedicated to integrated evidence-based interventions to improve the quality of life of persons with schizophrenia. Consideration of community care for those reluctant to maintain contact with mental health services has constituted the fifth block. Finally, authors have aggregated their own reflections regarding future trends. The number of psychosocial unmet needs is extensive. Vast research efforts will be needed to find appropriate ways to meet them, particularly regarding so-called existential needs, but many needs could be met only by applying existing evidence-based interventions. Reinforcing research on the implementation strategies and capacity building of professionals working in community settings might address this problem.

Brooding at admission was a significant predictor of post-treatment psychological variables of ""anxiety"", ""depression"", and ""psychological distress"", whereas craving at admission was a good predictor of ""perception of positive change"" at discharge.ConclusionOur results confirm the importance of brooding in mood regulation and its role in the development and maintenance of problem drinking. In addition, craving was negatively associated with the perception of positive change in the post-treatment outcomes and was a predictor of this psychological variable, which includes features related to the individual's resilience and strength. The changes in metacognitive beliefs regarding alcohol use were not statistically significant, but we found a reduction in positive metacognitions and an increase in negative alcohol-related beliefs; future studies are needed to further explore this issue.",0,1085

Biochimica et biophysica acta 1798(2","Phospholamban (PLN) is a dynamic single-pass membrane protein that inhibits the flow of Ca(2+) ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of heart muscle by directly binding to and inhibiting the SR Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA). The PLN monomer is the functionally active form that exists in equilibrium between ordered (T state) and disordered (R state) states. While the T state has been fully characterized using a hybrid solution/solid-state NMR approach, the R state structure has not been fully portrayed. It has, however, been detected by both NMR and EPR experiments in detergent micelles and lipid bilayers. In this work, we quantitatively probed the mus to ms dynamics of the PLN excited states by observing the T state in DPC micelles using CPMG relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy under functional conditions for SERCA. The (15)N backbone and (13)C(delta1) Ile-methyl dispersion curves were fit using a two-state equilibrium model, and indicate that residues within domain Ia (residues 1-16), the loop (17-22), and domain Ib (23-30) of PLN undergo mus-ms dynamics (k(ex)=6100+/-800 s(-1) at 17 degrees C). We measured k(ex) at additional temperatures, which allowed for a calculation of activation energy equal to approximately 5 kcal/mol. This energy barrier probably does not correspond to the detachment of the amphipathic domain Ia, but rather the energy needed to unwind domain Ib on the membrane surface, likely an important mechanism by which PLN converts between high and low affinity states for its binding partners.",0,1086

The neutral ground state is firmly identified as the cyclic (5)A1 state. For the anionic cluster, two nearly degenerate isomers were recognized, namely a cyclic (6)A1 state and a linear (6)Σ(+) state. Therefore, assignments of the observed bands in the photoelectron spectra of CrC2(-) have been made based on both of these isomers. With the exception of the B band all other experimental observed bands could be ascribed to the cyclic isomer. The computed detachment energies show that the former band must be exclusively assigned to the ionization of (6)Σ(+) of the linear structure, which can possibly also contribute to some higher energy bands. Additional support for the proposed assignments is provided by multidimensional Franck-Condon factor simulations for the (6)A1→(5)A1 and (6)A1→(5)B1 transitions that show a nearly perfect match with the observed vibrational progressions of the X and A bands in the 532 nm spectra.",0,1087

Specifically, the applicability of the method to such arteries as brachial, common, and internal carotid was examined. The method developed is based on analysis of two characteristic parameters: the value of the mean reflection coefficient modulus |Γ|(a) of the blood pressure wave and time delay Δt between the forward (travelling) and backward (reflected) blood pressure waves. The blood pressure wave was determined from ultrasound measurements of the artery's inner (internal) diameter, using the custom made wall tracking system (WTS) operating at 6.75 MHz. Clinical data were obtained from the carotid arteries measurements of 70 human subjects. These included the control group of 30 healthy individuals along with the patients diagnosed with the stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) ranging from 20% to 99% or with the ICA occlusion. The results indicate that with increasing level of stenosis of the ICA the value of the mean reflection coefficient measured in the common carotid artery, significantly increases from |Γ|(a)=0.45 for healthy individuals to |Γ|(a)=0.61 for patients with stenosis level of 90-99%, or ICA occlusion. Similarly, the time delay Δt decreases from 52 ms to 25 ms for the respective groups. The method described holds promise that it might be clinically useful as a non-invasive tool for localization of distal severe artery narrowing, which can assist in identifying early stages of atherosclerosis especially in regions, which are inaccessible for the ultrasound probe (e.g. carotid sinus or middle cerebral artery).",0,1088

Cornea 38(2","PURPOSE: To evaluate a deep learning-based method to automatically detect graft detachment (GD) after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) in anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). METHODS: In this study, a total of 1172 AS-OCT images (609: attached graft; 563: detached graft) were used to train and test a deep convolutional neural network to automatically detect GD after DMEK surgery in AS-OCT images. GD was defined as a not completely attached graft. After training with 1072 of these images (559: attached graft; 513: detached graft), the created classifier was tested with the remaining 100 AS-OCT scans (50: attached graft; 50 detached: graft). Hereby, a probability score for GD (GD score) was determined for each of the tested OCT images. RESULTS: The mean GD score was 0.88 +/- 0.2 in the GD group and 0.08 +/- 0.13 in the group with an attached graft. The differences between both groups were highly significant (P < 0.001). The sensitivity of the classifier was 98%, the specificity 94%, and the accuracy 96%. The coefficient of variation was 3.28 +/- 6.90% for the GD group and 2.82 +/- 3.81% for the graft attachment group. CONCLUSIONS: With the presented deep learning-based classifier, reliable automated detection of GD after DMEK is possible. Further work is needed to incorporate information about the size and position of GD and to develop a standardized approach regarding when rebubbling may be needed.",0,1089

Sensors (Basel, Switzerland","Understanding the root system architecture of plants as they develop is critical for increasing crop yields through plant phenotyping, and ultra-wideband imaging systems have shown potential as a portable, low-cost solution to non-destructive imaging root system architectures. This paper presents the design, implementation, and analysis of an ultra-wideband imaging system for use in imaging potted plant root system architectures. The proposed system is separated into three main subsystems: a Data Acquisition module, a Data Processing module, and an Image Processing and Analysis module. The Data Acquisition module consists of simulated and experimental implementations of a non-contact synthetic aperture radar system to measure ultra-wideband signal reflections from concealed scattering objects in a pot containing soil. The Data Processing module is responsible for interpreting the measured ultra-wideband signals and producing an image using a delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm. The Image Processing and Analysis module is responsible for improving image quality and measuring root depth and average root diameter in an unsupervised manner. The Image Processing and Analysis module uses a modified top-hat transformation alongside quantization methods based on energy distributions in the image to isolate the surface of the imaged root. Altogether, the proposed subsystems are capable of imaging and measuring concealed taproot system architectures with controlled soil conditions; however, the performance of the system is highly dependent on knowledge of the soil conditions. Smaller roots in difficult imaging conditions require future work into understanding and compensating for unwanted noise. Ultimately, this paper sought to provide insight into improving imaging quality of ultra-wideband (UWB) imaging systems for plant root imaging for other works to be followed.",0,1091

The pseudocontact shifts were input as experimental restraints in molecular dynamics simulations with or without NOE constraints. Both the magnitude and orientation of the susceptibility anisotropy tensor required for the shift calculations were determined during the simulations by iterative refinement. The pseudocontact shifts could be used to define the structure to a very high precision and accuracy compared with a corresponding NOE-determined structure. Convergence was obtained from different starting structures and tensors. A structure determination using both NOE's and pseudocontact shifts revealed a general agreement between the two data sets. However, some evidence for a discrepancy between NOE's and pseudocontact shifts was observed in the backbone and terminal base pairs of the DNA. Violations in shift or NOE restraints remaining in the final structures were examined and may be a reflection of motional averaging of the constraints and evidence for flexibility.

The aim was to evaluate how the application of of Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series OHSAS 18001.04 principles as well as Environmental protection Agency EPA and European Oil Company Organisation for Environment, Health and Safety CONCAWE practices have influenced air concentrations. Benzene air concentrations declined in 11 of 17 units, six of which were associated with declining exposures. Benzene air concentrations declined across all units on average by 46%. This amounts to an average yearly decline of 1.7%. TPH air concentrations declined in 10 of 17 units, seven of which were associated with declining exposures. The average decline in TPH air concentrations was 49%, corresponding to 1.3% per year. As a result, average working day exposure in 10 of 17 units have declined significantly and today, benzene and TPH exposure in most units are well below 10% of the current Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL8h:s). A decline in air concentrations have coincided with consistent implementation of control measures. Such measures include on-line monitoring of leaks; benzene recovery; floating container roofs; improved valves and seals; hermetic pumps; recovery of loading gases and instalment of torches in terminals; cutback in coke combustion; a new production line spanning directly from the dock to aromatics production; and recovery of loading gases in the doc. Other tools in exposure management include personal leak monitors, on-line measurements, monitoring campaigns, risk assessment, and availability and user training of protective equipment. However, improvements are still needed. Hydrocarbon or benzene air concentrations have not declined in 8 of 17 units, in some of which concentrations exceed 10% of the relevant OEL8h value. In addition, for benzene even 10% of the current OEL, 0.1 ppm, might still possess a risk. With this in mind, methods to estimate exposure at the refineries need to be improved to enable measuring benzene concentrations <0.1 ppm. Shut downs of the refinery have been associated with peaks in exposure concentrations. Consequently, effort should be placed on safe working methods pertaining to shutdowns. Also, the connection and detachment of hoses continues to be problematic from the point of view of controlling exposure.",0,1095

This measure is sensitive to individual reflections and does not refer to the eventual data incompleteness and anisotropy; it therefore does not describe the data well. A physically relevant and robust measure that provides a universal way to define the `actual' effective resolution deff of a data set is introduced. This measure is based on the accurate calculation of the minimum distance between two immobile point scatterers resolved as separate peaks in the Fourier map calculated with a given set of reflections. This measure is applicable to any data set, whether complete or incomplete. It also allows characterizion of the anisotropy of diffraction data sets in which deff strongly depends on the direction. Describing mathematical objects, the effective resolution deff characterizes the `geometry' of the set of measured reflections and is irrelevant to the diffraction intensities. At the same time, the diffraction intensities reflect the composition of the structure from physical entities: the atoms. The minimum distance for the atoms typical of a given structure is a measure that is different from and complementary to deff; it is also a characteristic that is complementary to conventional measures of the data-set quality. Following the previously introduced terms, this value is called the optical resolution, dopt. The optical resolution as defined here describes the separation of the atomic images in the `ideal' crystallographic Fourier map that would be calculated if the exact phases were known.

Increasingly over the past two decades, training manuals have been used to impart explicit guidelines to beginning psychotherapists. In addition, manuals offer a means for helping more experienced therapists to learn new approaches, while also allowing careful research on the relative efficacy of different psychotherapies. In some instances, manuals have been designed specifically to address troublesome transference and countertransference issues (e.g., Time-Limited Dynamic Psychotherapy; Strupp & Binder, 1984). But even manualized treatments that target hostile interactions between therapist and patient are sometimes of limited use in teaching therapists to work with difficult patients, as illustrated by the Vanderbilt II Psychotherapy Research Project. Experimental research on the distinctions between implicit learning and explicit learning (e.g., Lee & Vakoch, 1996) helps explain the constraints of manualized treatments. By relying on explicit, clearly articulated guidelines, treatments conducted in accordance with manuals may interfere with tacit reasoning processes. As a consequence of the strong emphasis that manuals place on explicit rules for treatment, this type of training can hinder the development of complex clinical judgments.

Biophysical journal 95(10","It is well established that Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptides reduce the membrane barrier to ion transport. The prevailing model ascribes the resulting interference with ion homeostasis to the formation of peptide pores across the bilayer. In this work, we examine the interaction of soluble prefibrillar amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42))-oligomers with bilayer models, observing also dramatic increases in ion current at micromolar peptide concentrations. We demonstrate that the Abeta-induced ion conductances across free-standing membranes and across substrate-supported ""tethered"" bilayers are quantitatively similar and depend on membrane composition. However, characteristic signatures of the molecular transport mechanism were distinctly different from ion transfer through water-filled pores, as shown by a quantitative comparison of the membrane response to Abeta-oligomers and to the bacterial toxin alpha-hemolysin. Neutron reflection from tethered membranes showed that Abeta-oligomers insert into the bilayer, affecting both membrane leaflets. By measuring the capacitance of peptide-free membranes, as well as their geometrical thicknesses, the dielectric constants in the aliphatic cores of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers were determined to be epsilon = 2.8 and 2.2, respectively. The magnitude of the Abeta-induced increase in epsilon indicates that Abeta-oligomers affect membranes by inducing lateral heterogeneity in the bilayers, but an increase in the water content of the bilayers was not observed. The activation energy for Abeta-induced ion transport across the membrane is at least three times higher than that measured for membranes reconstituted with alpha-hemolysin pores, E(a) = 36.8 vs. 9.9 kJ/mol, indicating that the molecular mechanisms underlying both transport processes are fundamentally different. The Abeta-induced membrane conductance shows a nonlinear dependence on the peptide concentration in the membrane. Moreover, E(a) depends on peptide concentration. These observations suggest that cooperativity and/or conformational changes of the Abeta-oligomer particles upon transfer from the aqueous to the hydrocarbon environment play a prominent role in the interaction of the peptide with the membrane. A model in which Abeta-oligomers insert into the hydrophobic core of the membrane-where they lead to a local increase in epsilon and a concomitant reduction of the membrane barrier-describes the experimental data quantitatively.",0,1104

Results: In the whole sample, levels of depression and rumination decreased and mindfulness and quality of life increased over treatment. Levels of depressive symptoms, mindfulness, and quality of life remained stable over the 1-year follow-up period. Rumination further decreased. Remitted and depressed patients at the start of the trial did not differ in terms of outcome during or after treatment. Conclusions: Long-term outcome after MBCT in depressed patients was comparable to those who were in remission at the start of the trial. These findings lend further support to the notion that recurrent depressed patients meeting the criteria of a depressive episode do not need to be excluded from MBCT.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 34(6","Several studies have investigated the neural correlates of self-reflection. In the paradigm most commonly used to address this concept, a subject is presented with trait adjectives or sentences and asked whether they describe him or her. Functional neuroimaging research has revealed a set of regions known as Cortical Midline Structures (CMS) appearing to be critically involved in self-reflection processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that patients suffering damage to the CMS, have difficulties in properly evaluating the problems they encounter and often overestimate their capacities and performance. Building on previous work, a meta-analysis of published fMRI and PET studies on self-reflection was conducted. The results showed that two areas within the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) are important in reflective processing, namely the ventral (v) and dorsal (d) MPFC. In this paper a model is proposed in which the vMPFC is responsible for tagging information relevant for 'self', whereas the dMPFC is responsible for evaluation and decision-making processes in self- and other-referential processing. Finally, implications of the model for schizophrenia and lack of insight are noted.",0,1106

Applied spectroscopy 62(6","The feasibility of liquid-phase evanescent-wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (EW-CRDS) for surface-binding studies under flow-injection analysis (FIA) conditions is demonstrated. The EW-CRDS setup consists of an anti-reflection coated Dove prism inside a linear cavity (with standard or super-polishing of the total internal reflective (TIR) surface). A teflon spacer with an elliptical hole clamped on this surface acts as a 20 muL sized flow cell. The baseline noise of this system is of the order of 10(-4) absorbance units; the baseline remains stable over a prolonged time and the prism surface does not become contaminated during repeated injections of the reversibly adsorbing test dyes Crystal Violet (CV) and Direct Red 10 (DR10). At typical FIA or liquid chromatography (LC) flow rates, the system has sufficient specificity to discriminate between species with different surface affinities. For CV a much stronger decrease in ring-down time is observed than calculated based on its bulk concentration and the effective depth probed by the evanescent wave, indicating binding of this positively charged dye to the negatively charged prism surface. The amount of adsorption can be influenced by adjusting the flow rate or the eluent composition. At a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, an enrichment factor of 60 was calculated for CV; for the poorly adsorbing dye DR10 it is 5. Super-polishing of the already polished TIR surface works counter-productively. The adsorbing dye Crystal Violet has a detection limit of 3 muM for the standard polished surface; less binding occurs on the super-polished surface and the detection limit is 5 muM. Possible applications of EW-CRDS for studying surface binding or the development of bio-assays are discussed.",0,1107

METHOD: A representative sample of the Swedish working population was approached in 2010, 2012, and 2014, and 2316 respondents were included in this longitudinal full-panel survey study. Structural equation modelling was performed to analyse the temporal relations between job demands, work-related PC, and sleep quality. Additionally, a subsample (N = 1149) consisting of individuals who reported the same level of exposure to job demands during all three waves (i.e. stable high, stable moderate, or stable low job demands) was examined in relation to PC and sleep quality over time. RESULTS: Analyses showed that job demands, PC, and poor sleep quality were positively and reciprocally related. Work-related PC mediated the normal and reversed, direct across-wave relations between job demands and sleep quality. Individuals with continuous high job demands reported significantly lower sleep quality and higher work-related PC, compared to individuals with continuous moderate/low job demands. CONCLUSION: This study substantiated reciprocal relations between job demands, work-related PC, and sleep quality and supported work-related PC as an underlying mechanism of the reciprocal job demands-sleep relationship. Moreover, this study showed that chronically high job demands are a risk factor for low sleep quality.",0,1108

The Journal of experimental biology 220: 4479-4485.","Mole-rats are known to use their protruding, chisel-like incisors to dig underground networks of tunnels, but it remains unknown how these incisors are used to break and displace the soil. Theoretically, different excavation strategies can be used. Mole-rats could either use their head depressor muscles to power scooping motions of the upper incisors (by nose-down head rotations) or the lower incisors (by nose-up head rotations), or their jaw adductors to grab and break the soil after penetrating both sets of incisors into the ground, or a combination of these mechanisms. To identify how chisel-tooth digging works, a kinematic analysis of this behaviour was performed based on high-speed videos of 19 individuals from the African mole-rat species Fukomys micklemi placed inside transparent tubes in a laboratory setting. Our analysis showed that the soil is penetrated by both the upper and lower incisors at a relatively high gape angle, generally with the head rotated nose-up. Initially, the upper incisors remain approximately stationary to function as an anchor to allow an upward movement of the lower incisors to grab the soil. Next, a quick, nose-down rotation of the head further detaches the soil and drops the soil below the head. Consequently, both jaw adduction and head depression are jointly used to power tooth-digging in F. micklemi The same mechanism, but with longer digging cycles, and soil being thrown down at smaller gape sizes, was used when digging in harder soil.",0,1109

Progress in biophysics and molecular biology 93(1-3","This review forms part of a series of papers resulting from a workshop on safety of ultrasound applications. The physical effects of ultrasound include generation of steady streaming in large fluid volumes, and micro-streaming around contrast bubbles. Such streaming induces shear stress acting on the vascular endothelium. This review provides a discussion on the levels of endothelial shear stress associated with diagnostic ultrasound applications, and on the biological effects of shear stress acting on the endothelial cells. Depending on vessel size and ultrasound characteristics, shear stresses associated with streaming and micro-streaming may exceed the physiological levels associated with the flow of blood by many orders of magnitude. The resulting biological effects could range anywhere from activation of normal shear stress sensors such as ion channels, damage of the endothelial surface layer, reversible perforation of the membrane, to cell detachment and lysis. The possible presence of such biological effects does not necessarily mean that the effects are harmful for the individual. However, considering the ever-increasing use of ultrasound, a further investigation into these shear stress-related effects, using both experiments and modelling, is desired. Apart from safety concerns, such effects may provide a base for strategies aimed at targeted delivery of drugs.",0,1110

Vaccine 27(1","Advances towards protective vaccines against malaria were made feasible by the development of a rodent model of mammalian malaria that allowed production of all stages of the malaria parasite for study. Investigations with sporozoites (the stage transmitted by mosquitoes in their saliva) demonstrated that immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites could produce a solid, sterile immunity, first shown in studies with mice and later with human volunteers. Protective immune mechanisms involve anti-sporozoite antibodies that immobilize sporozoites injected into the skin by mosquitoes, followed by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells acting against liver stage parasites produced by sporozoites that have escaped antibody-based immunity and invaded hepatocytes. Two alternative approaches now being used in human trials are immunization with intact, attenuated sporozoites vs. immunization with ""sub-unit"" vaccines based on immunogenic components of sporozoites or liver stage parasites. In addition to immunization against these pre-erythrocytic stages, encouraging progress is being made on immunization against blood stage parasites and on immunization for production of transmission-blocking antibodies. There is reason to be optimistic that one or more of the approaches will work on a large scale, and that a multi-stage vaccine may be able to combine several of these approaches in a sequential immunological assault against the malaria parasite as it progresses through its stages.",0,1112

Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 57: 93-99.","Rumination is a cognitive–affective thinking style that plays a key role in the onset and maintenance of depression. Recently, it was shown that clinically depressed patients who received a neurocognitive training—involving two weeks of repetitive cognitive control exercises that necessitate prefrontal engagement—are more able to control over ruminative negative thoughts than patients who only received treatment as usual. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a biological technique that can directly modulate prefrontal excitability via the manipulation of neural membrane potentials. In this randomized double-blind trial, we investigated whether bifrontal tDCS (anode over the left/cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) would enhance the influence of a neurocognitive training on depressive brooding, the maladaptive form of rumination. Major depressed patients were trained using a procedure based on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a task that relies heavily on working memory and is found to engage the DLPFC. One group (n = 19) completed the PASAT training together with active tDCS and another group (n = 14) completed the same training together with sham (placebo) tDCS. In both groups, depressive brooding was reduced following the PASAT training. Moreover, we observed that improvement in working memory over the course of the training was associated with a greater reduction in depressive brooding post- versus pre-intervention. However, tDCS did not moderate this association between changes in working memory and changes in depressive brooding. Possible explanations for this absent moderation of tDCS, as well as avenues for future research to influence ruminative thinking in depression, are discussed.

However, the handbook is vague with respect to whether distress is crucial to the diagnosis of mental disorders, and a conceptual framework on the precise nature of distress is lacking. As a result, it remains vague how the term 'distress' is to be taken into account in actual diagnostic situations: the DSM-5 provides no operational framework for diagnosing distress. The authors argue that the work of Georges Canguilhem, who focuses on the topic of abnormality and pathology, and Paul Ricoeur's philosophical reflections on the theme of mental suffering may provide a structure for conceptualizing and evaluating distress. Ricoeur's phenomenological model of mental suffering is discussed. Here, mental suffering can be thought of in terms of the relationship between self and other, and also in terms of the continuum made up by, what he terms, languishing and acting. Ricoeur suggests that distress is not a quantity that can be measured, but a characteristic that should be studied qualitatively in interpersonal and narrative contexts. Consequently, diagnosticians should describe and document how individuals experience subjective distress. On a practical level, this means that clinicians' ideas about patients' distress should be embedded in case formulations. A detailed evaluation of an individual's pathos-experience should be made before conclusions are drawn with regard to diagnosis.",0,1114

These problems are especially evident in critical care, where monitoring of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol provides an excellent opportunity to study the efficacy of applications that allow for the rapid capture of event information, providing theoretically-driven feedback using the data. Our goal was, (a) to design and implement a way to capture data on deviation from the standard practice based on the theoretical foundation of error classification from our past research, (b) to provide a means to meaningfully visualize the collected data, and (c) to provide a proof-of-concept for this implementation, using some understanding of user experience in clinical practice.METHODSWe present the design and development of a web application designed to be used primarily on mobile devices and a summary data viewer to allow clinicians to, (a) track their activities, (b) provide real-time feedback of deviations from guidelines and protocols, and (c) provide summary feedback highlighting decisions made. We used a framework previously developed to classify activities in trauma as the theoretical foundation of the rules designed to do the same algorithmically, in our application. Attending physicians at a Level 1 trauma center used the application in the clinical setting and provided feedback for iterative development. Informal interviews and surveys were used to gain some deeper understanding of the user experience using this application in-situ.RESULTSActivity visualizations were created highlighting decisions made during a trauma code as well as classification of tasks per the theoretical framework. The attendings reviewed the efficacy of the data visualizations as part of their interviews. We also conducted a proof-of-concept evaluation by way of usability questionnaire. Two attendings rated 4 out of the usability 6 categories highly (inter-rater reliability: R = 0.87; weighted kappa = 0.59). This could be attributed to the fact that they were able to fit the use of the application into their regular workflow during a trauma code relatively seamlessly.

Parasit Vectors 11(1","BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess the ability of fed male Dermacentor reticulatus ticks to transmit Babesia canis to dogs after being detached from previous canine or ovine hosts. METHODS: The study was an exploratory, parallel group design conducted in two trials. All the animals were sero-negative for babesiosis prior to enrolment. In a first trial, donor dogs and donor sheep were infested with Babesia canis infected male and uninfected female ticks for 72 h. The ticks were detached and the second group of host dogs were infested for 24 h before tick removal. In a second trial, the experiment was repeated but the donor animals were infested for 88 h and the second group of host dogs were infested for 8 h prior to tick removal. After infestation, the dogs were maintained under clinical surveillance and blood samples were collected for blood smear, IFA and PCR analysis. A dog was considered infected if any of these tests were positive. RESULTS: All of the dogs (6 out of 6) were infected after being exposed to pre-activated male ticks for 24 h. Half of the dogs were infected after being exposed to pre-activated ticks for 8 h: 1 out of 3 dogs infested with ticks removed from sheep and 2 out of 3 dogs infested with ticks removed from dog. All the infected dogs were positive to blood smear, IFA and PCR. Three of these dogs exhibited elevated body temperature (> 39.4 degrees C). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability of male D. reticulatus to transmit B. canis to dogs. The study also illustrates for the first time that, regardless of the first host on which ticks may attach and start feeding, Babesia canis can be transmitted to dogs within 8 h of infestation. Since no minimal transmission time can be established for all possible natural situations, a strategy of prevention based on anti-attachment or repellency is recommended.",0,1117

The main findings relate nurses' limit-setting interventions to two simultaneous and conflicting perspectives. That is: the dominating perspective of correcting, aimed at changing patients' behaviour by external control through three nursing roles of caregiver, educator and gatekeeper; the weaker perspective of acknowledging, where patients are seen as capable of changing themselves from within. The nurse's role reflects compassion and values patients' integrity. The nurses' work was based on a rationality of coping, because of a balancing act between the two perspectives and conflicting intrapersonal feelings aroused in challenging encounters with patients and colleagues.

We found that the majority of epitopes were defined for dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV). The prominence of DENV and WNV data in the epitope literature is likely a reflection of their overall worldwide impact on human disease, and the lack of vaccines. Conversely, the relatively smaller number of epitopes defined for the other viruses within the genus (yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis virus) most likely reflects the presence of established prophylaxis and/or their more modest impact on morbidity and mortality globally.

Despite effective anti-angiogenic therapies for the less prevalent neovascular form of AMD, treatments are lacking for the more prevalent dry form. Similarities in risk factors and pathogenesis between AMD and atherosclerosis have led investigators to study the effects of statins on AMD incidence and progression with mixed results. A limitation of these studies has been the heterogeneity of AMD disease and the lack of standardization in statin dosage.OBJECTIVEWe were interested in studying the effects of high-dose statins, similar to those showing regression of atherosclerotic plaques, in AMD.DESIGNPilot multicenter open-label prospective clinical study of 26 patients with diagnosis of AMD and the presence of many large, soft drusenoid deposits.

HlyA is synthetized as a protoxin (ProHlyA) that is transformed into the active form in the bacterial cytosol by the covalent linkage of two fatty-acyl moieties to the polypeptide chain before the secretion of HlyA into the extracellular medium. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the fatty acylation of HlyA on protein conformation and protein-membrane interactions. Polarization-modulated infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) experiments were performed at the air-water interface, and lipid monolayers mimicking the outer leaflet of red-blood-cell membranes were used as model systems for the study of protein-membrane interaction. According to surface-pressure measurements, incorporation of the acylated protein into the lipid films was faster than that of the nonacylated form. PM-IRRAS measurements revealed that the adsorption of the proteins to the lipid monolayers induced disorder in the lipid acyl chains and also changed the elastic properties of the films independently of protein acylation. No significant difference was observed between HlyA and ProHlyA in the interaction with the model lipid monolayers; but when these proteins became adsorbed on a bare air-water interface, they adopted different secondary structures.

Puncture's mechanical effects have been shown near the puncture site, mechanical effects should be observed far, relative to needle size, from the puncture site, given the disc-wide damage induced by the stab. The aim of this work was to quantify these far-field effects, and to observe the local structural damage provoked by the needle. Strips of cow tail annulus fibrosus underwent two consecutive mechanical loadings to 5% tensile strain; fifteen samples were punctured in a radial direction with a randomly assigned needle between the two loadings (needle gauges between 19 and 23). Ten samples (control group) were not punctured. During loading, the tissue strains were imaged using second harmonic generation microscopy in a <600×800µm region about 4.4mm from the puncture site. After mechanical testing, the puncture site was imaged in 3D. Puncture had no significant effect on annulus elastic modulus. Imaging showed a modest change in the shearing between fibre bundles however, the linear strain between bundles, intra-bundle shear and linear strain were not significantly affected. At the puncture site, detached lumps of tissue were present. These results suggest that the mechanical effects observed in intact discs are due to the depressurization of the disc, rather than the local damage to the annulus. Needle profiles could be designed, aiming at separating fibre bundles rather than cutting through them, to avoid leaving dying tissue behind.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCENeedle puncture of the intervertebral disc can initiate a mechanical and biochemical cascade leading to disc degeneration, but the link between the local damage of the puncture and the disc-wide effects is not well understood. This work aimed at determining the micro-mechanical effects of the puncture far from its site, and to observe the damage induced by the puncture with high resolution imaging. Results show that the puncture had modest effect far from the puncture, but lumps of tissue were left by the needle, detached from the disc; these could cause further damage through friction and inflammation of the surrounding tissues. This suggests that the cascade leading to degeneration is probably driven by a biochemical response rather than disc-wide mechanical effects.",0,1124

Journal of biomechanics 38(3","Decorin belongs to the small leucine proteoglycans family and is considered to play an important role in extracellular matrix organization. Experimental studies suggest that decorin is required for the assembly of collagen fibrils, as well as for the development of proper tissue mechanical properties. In tendons, decorins tie adjoining collagen fibrils together and probably guarantee the mechanical coupling of fibrils. The decorin molecule consists of one core protein and one glycosaminoglycan chain covalently linked to a serine residue of the core protein. Several studies have indicated that each core protein binds to the surface of collagen fibrils every 67 nm, by interacting non-covalently to one collagen molecule of the fibril surface, while the decorin glycosaminoglycans extend from the core protein to connect to another decorin core protein laying on adjacent fibril surface. The present paper investigates the complex composed of one decorin core protein and one collagen molecule in order to obtain their binding force. For this purpose, molecular models of collagen molecules type I and decorin core protein were developed and their interaction energies were evaluated by means of the molecular mechanics approach. Results show that the complex is characterized by a maximum binding force of about 12.4 x 10(3) nN and a binding stiffness of 8.33 x 10(-8) N/nm; the attained binding force is greater than the glycosaminoglycan chain's ultimate strength, thus indicating that overloads are likely to damage the collagen fibre's mechanical integrity by disrupting the glycosaminoglycan chains rather than by causing decorin core protein detachment from the collagen fibril.",0,1125

One effective strategy involves the pretreatment with ionic liquids which enables enzymatic saccharification of wood within a few hours under mild conditions. This pretreatment strategy is, however, limited by water and the ionic liquids are rather expensive. The scarce understanding of the involved effects, however, challenges the design of alternative pretreatment concepts. This work investigates the multi length-scale effects of pretreatment of wood in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc) in mixtures with water using spectroscopy, X-ray and neutron scattering.RESULTSThe structure of beech wood is disintegrated in EMIMAc/water mixtures with a water content up to 8.6 wt%. Above 10.7 wt%, the pretreated wood is not disintegrated, but still much better digested enzymatically compared to native wood. In both regimes, component analysis of the solid after pretreatment shows an extraction of few percent of lignin and hemicellulose. In concentrated EMIMAc, xylan is extracted more efficiently and lignin is defunctionalized. Corresponding to the disintegration at macroscopic scale, SANS and XRD show isotropy and a loss of crystallinity in the pretreated wood, but without distinct reflections of type II cellulose. Hence, the microfibril assembly is decrystallized into rather amorphous cellulose within the cell wall.CONCLUSIONSThe molecular and structural changes elucidate the processes of wood pretreatment in EMIMAc/water mixtures. In the aqueous regime with >10.7 wt% water in EMIMAc, xyloglucan and lignin moieties are extracted, which leads to coalescence of fibrillary cellulose structures. Dilute EMIMAc/water mixtures thus resemble established aqueous pretreatment concepts. In concentrated EMIMAc, the swelling due to decrystallinization of cellulose, dissolution of cross-linking xylan, and defunctionalization of lignin releases the mechanical stress to result in macroscopic disintegration of cells. The remaining cell wall constituents of lignin and hemicellulose, however, limit a recrystallization of the solvated cellulose. These pretreatment mechanisms are beyond common pretreatment concepts and pave the way for a formulation of mechanistic requirements of pretreatment with simpler pretreatment liquors.",0,1126

Water Res 143: 66-76.","Rapid quantification of absolute microbial cell abundances is important for a comprehensive interpretation of microbiome surveys and crucial to support theoretical modelling and the design of engineered systems. In this paper, we propose a protocol specifically optimised for the quantification of microbial abundances in water biofilters using flow cytometry (FCM). We optimised cell detachment from sand biofilter particles for FCM quantification through the evaluation of five chemical dispersants (NaCl, Triton-X100, CaCl2, sodium pyrophosphate (PP), Tween 80 combined with PP), different mechanical pre-treatments (low and high energy sonication and shaking) and two fixation methods (glutaraldehyde and ethanol). The developed protocol was cross-compared using other established and commonly employed methods for biomass quantification in water filter samples (adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and volatile solids (VS)). The highest microbial count was obtained by detaching the biofilm from biofilter grains and dispersing clusters into singles cells using Tween 80 and sodium pyrophosphate combined with four steps of high energy sonication (27W, for 80s each step); glutaraldehyde was shown to be the best fixative solution. The developed protocol was reliable and highly reproducible and produced results that are comparable to data from alternative quantification methods. Indeed, high correlations were found with trends obtained through ATP and qPCR (rho=0.98 and rho=0.91) measurements. The VS content was confirmed as an inaccurate method to express biomass in sand samples since it correlated poorly with all the other three methods (rho=0.005 with FCM, 0.002 with ATP and 0.177 with qPCR). FCM and ATP showed the strongest agreement between absolute counts with a slope of the correlation equal to 0.7, while qPCR seemed to overestimate cell counts by a factor of ten. The rapidity and reproducibility of the method developed make its application ideal for routine quantification of microbial cell abundances on sand from water biofilters and thus useful in revealing the ecological patterns and quantifying the metabolic kinetics involved in such systems.",0,1127

Two generalizations can be enunciated from the studies reviewed. First, the study of mutant IFM proteomes provides insight into how proteins are functionally organized in the myofibril.

Animal 12(3","Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is usually characterized by abnormal and intermittent drops in rumen pH. Nevertheless, high individual animal variability in rumen pH and the difference in measurement methods for pH data acquisition decrease the sensitivity and accuracy of pH indicators for detecting SARA in ruminants. The aim of this study was to refine rumen pH indicators in long-term SARA based on individual dairy cow reticulo-rumen pH kinetics. Animal performances and rumen parameters were studied weekly in order to validate SARA syndrome and rumen pH was continuously measured using reticulo-rumen sensors. In total, 11 primiparous dairy cows were consecutively fed two different diets for 12 successive weeks: a control diet as low-starch diet (LSD; 13% starch for 4 weeks in period 1), an acidotic diet as high-starch diet (HSD; 32% starch for 4 weeks in period 2), and again the LSD diet (3 weeks in period 3). There was a 1-week dietary transition between LSD and HSD. Commonly used absolute SARA pH indicators such as daily average, area under the curve (AUC) and time spent below pH<5.8 and pH<6 were processed from absolute (raw) daily kinetics. Then signal processing was applied to raw pH values in order to calculate relative pH indicators by filtering and normalizing data to remove inter-individual variability, sensor drift and sensor noise. Normalized AUC, times spent below NpH<-0.3 and NpH<-0.5, NpH range and NpH standard deviation were calculated. Those relative pH indicators were compared with commonly used pH indicators to assess their ability to detect SARA. This syndrome induced by HSD was confirmed by consistent expected changes in milk quality, dry matter intake and acetate : propionate ratio in the rumen, whereas the ruminal concentration of lipopolysaccharide was increased. Commonly used pH SARA indicators were not able to discriminate SARA syndrome due to high animal variability and sensor drift and noise, whereas relative pH indicators developed in this study appeared more relevant for SARA detection as assessed by receiver operating characteristic tests. This work shows that absolute pH kinetics should be corrected for drift, noise and animal variability to produce relative pH indicators that are more robust for SARA detection. These relative pH indicators could be more relevant for identifying affected animals in a herd and also for comparing SARA risk among studies.",0,1129

In the REACH registry, 15.9% of patients with either established atherosclerotic arterial disease or at least 3 risk factors for atherothrombosis had symptomatic polyvascular disease. History of risk factors and known co-morbidities, as well as a thorough physical examination, are mandatory in the initial screening and diagnostic work-up. Various non-invasive imaging techniques (duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography) can be used for the identification of the polyvascular patient. Digital subtraction angiography is now used almost exclusively in association with endovascular procedures. Appropriate implementation of each technique is based on international guidelines and a multidisciplinary discussion for each case. The presence of co-existing disease in a different vascular bed is associated with a higher risk of recurrent symptoms and complications in the first site. In this context, accumulating evidence suggests that arterial biomarkers, such as arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), central blood pressures, wave reflections indices, ankle-brachial index, carotid intimamedia thickness, as well as vasculogenic erectile dysfunction, can predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality beyond classical risk factors and prediction models. An important pending question is whether identification of multisite arterial disease may improve clinical outcomes in patients who are already in secondary prevention programs. Such screening of asymptomatic multisite artery disease in patients with known CVD would be of paramount importance if it is ultimately proven with hard evidence that it should lead to a different management from the one proposed for CVD patients without multisite artery disease.",0,1130

Bioactive coatings aimed at mitigating fibrous adhesions are one of the approaches to alleviate the problem. In this paper, we are developing a bioactive coating based upon a magnetoelastic (ME) material that vibrates in response to an ac magnetic field. In order to establish these coatings for this purpose, the ME material was first rendered bioactive through the sequential addition of polyurethane and chitosan thin films. Indirect live/dead assays were performed showing increased cell viability for polyurethane and chitosan-coated sensors compared to the uncoated controls. Direct adhesion experiments were performed to test the response of fibroblasts cultured on static and vibrated ME materials. Results showed cells adherent to static but not vibrated coatings. Detached cells showed no viability loss compared to controls. The finding that submicrometer ME vibrations can prevent cell adhesion in vitro without inducing cell death suggests the potential of these coatings to effectively control interfacial fibrosis. Future work will address the effect of vibrations on cell morphology and local gene expression in vitro, as well as fibrous tissue formation in vivo.",0,1131

In this investigation particular interest is drawn on the question how the propagation characteristics of bulk acoustic waves are affected by diffusion layers. The reflection and transmission behavior of bulk acoustic waves encountering a continuum having a spatially dependent sound velocity is discussed based on numerical simulations as well as on experimental verifications. The simulated results are part of an on-going project in which material properties of MEMS devices are investigated by short pulse laser acoustic methods. Mechanical waves are excited and detected thermoelastically using laser pulses of 70 fs duration. For metals this leads to wavelengths of 10-20 nm and the corresponding frequencies amount to 0.3-0.6 THz. In contrast to previous work done in this field in which diffusion effects are generally considered as undesirable phenomena, the deliberate realization of microstructures having well defined gradually varying material properties in one or more dimensions represents a goal of this investigation. For metallic thin film multilayers thermally induced diffusion processes have shown to be an easy and reliable technique for the realization of layered structures having continuously varying mechanical properties within several 10 nm. Among the experimental methods suitable for the in-depth profiling of submicron metallic thin films providing resolutions of several nanometers, are short pulse laser acoustic methods, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). Short pulse laser acoustic methods and RBS have the advantage to be nondestructive. The short pulse laser acoustic method is described in detail and RBS measurements are presented for verification purposes.

The Journal of chemical physics 139(20","In the framework of classical fluctuation theory an analytical formula is derived for the reversible work of formation of just detached carbon cap on the surface of catalyst nanoparticle (NP). This cap is considered as single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) formation center. The work of cap formation depends on the source carbon chemical potential μC. Using the derived formula for this work an expression for the rate of SWCNT formation is determined. From this expression the SWCNT diameter distributions can be obtained. The obtained distributions have sharp maxima. It is found that the modal SWCNT diameter d(m) increases weakly with μC being in the narrow window of 1.0 < d(m) < 1.8 nm when changing the source carbon chemical potential in a wide range. The determined diameter distributions proved to be in a good agreement with the typical values of the SWCNT diameters as experimentally measured in the chemical vapor deposition process. The increase of d(m) is accompanied by the increase of the distribution width Δd. The selectivity d(m)/Δd is a function of μC, the higher values of μC the worse selectivity is observed. Although the value of the SWCNT formation rate I cannot be calculated precisely the relationship between I and the system parameters, such as the NP radius R(S), can be obtained. This relationship is derived for the solid-liquid-solid system. To determine the function I(R(S)) for nanotubes of a certain diameter d, formulas for catalyst∕amorphous carbon mutual solubilities as functions of NP radius are derived in the framework of the rigorous Gibbs theory of interface. Using the derived formulas an expression giving the dependence I(R(S)) is obtained. The expression predicts an increase of I with the radius R(S). The estimations carried out for the metal/carbon interface surface tension of 1000 mN/m show that the SWCNT formation rate increases by a few orders of magnitude with the radius increase from 1 to 10 nm.",0,1134

SpringerPlus 5(1","BACKGROUNDMany issues concerning sample processing for intracellular metabolite studies in filamentous fungi still need to be solved, e.g. how to reduce the contact time of the biomass to the quenching solution in order to minimize metabolite leakage. Since the required time to separate the biomass from the quenching solution determines the contact time, speeding up this step is thus of utmost interest. Recently, separation approaches based on cold-filtration were introduced as promising alternative to cold-centrifugation, which exhibit considerably reduced contact times. In previous works we were unable to obtain a compact pellet from cold methanol quenched samples of the filamentous fungus Penicillium ochrochloron CBS 123.824 via centrifugation. Therefore our aim was to establish for this organism a separation technique based on cold-filtration to determine intracellular levels of a selected set of nucleotides.RESULTSWe developed a cold-filtration based technique as part of our effort to revise the entire sample processing method and analytical procedure. The Filtration-Resuspension (FiltRes) device combined in a single apparatus (1) a rapid cold-filtration and (2) a rapid resuspension of the biomass in hot extraction solution. Unique to this is the injection of the extraction solution from below the membrane filter (FiltRes-principle). This caused the mycelial cake to detach completely from the filter membrane and to float upwards so that the biomass could easily be transferred into preheated tubes for metabolite extraction. The total contact time of glucose-limited chemostat mycelium to the quenching solution could be reduced to 15.7 ± 2.5 s, whereby each washing step added another 10-15 s. We evaluated critical steps like filtration time, temperature profile, reproducibility of results, and using the energy charge (EC) as a criterion, effectiveness of enzyme destruction during the transition in sample temperature from cold to hot. As control we used total broth samples quenched in hot ethanol. Averaged over all samples an EC of 0.93 ± 0.020 was determined with the FiltRes-principle compared to 0.89 ± 0.049 with heat stopped total broth samples.CONCLUSIONSWe concluded that for P. ochrochloron this technique is a reliable sample processing method for intracellular metabolite analysis, which might offer also other possible applications.",0,1135

Protections against these risks include the knowledge that appropriate and equivalent veterinary education will enable detection and characterization of emerging disease agents, as well as an appropriate response, wherever they occur. Global veterinary leadership is needed to reduce the global threat of infectious diseases of major food animal and public health importance. We believe that the co-curriculum is an excellent way to prepare and train veterinarians and future leaders who understand and can deal with global issues. The key to the success of the program is the veterinarian's understanding that there is a cultural basis to the practice of veterinary medicine in any country. The result will be a cadre of veterinarians, faculty, and other professionals who are better able (language and culture) to understand the effects of change brought about by free trade and the importance of interdisciplinary and institutional relationships to deal effectively with national and regional issues of food safety and security. New global veterinary leadership programs will build on interests, experience, ideas, and ambitions. A college that wishes to take advantage of this diversity must offer opportunities that interest veterinarians throughout their careers and that preferably connect academic study with intensive experiential training in another country. At its best, the global veterinary leadership program would include a partnership between veterinarians and several international learning centers, a responsiveness to the identified international outreach needs of the profession, and attention to critical thinking and reflection. The global veterinary leadership program we have described is intended to be a set of ideas meant to promote collaboration, coalitions, and discussion among veterinarians and veterinary educators who may be intrigued by the concept. The impact of the program can be summarized as follows: Outreach Programs: The global veterinary leadership program will establish new partnerships between veterinarians and veterinary college faculty as they supervise the international internships and see a relationship between their goals and the value of food safety to this country. Strategic Opportunity: The program will build on the critical role that US veterinarians and veterinary colleges already play in strengthening the safety of free trade in this hemisphere. Diversity in an Age of Specialization: The program will combine a global orientation, language ability, and access to comprehensive, research- and economic-related work/study opportunities to expose veterinarians to the expanding world market for veterinary expertise. New Linkages Through Corporate Partners: Through the success and high visibility of current research and education programs, most veterinary colleges are well positioned to engage industry, government, and university leaders in ways to use the proposed program to increase the flow of new ideas and talent into the world food enterprise. International Funding: A new partnership among veterinarians, industry, government, and university leaders can coordinate strong multilateral requests for funding from national and international sources.

A key element of their treatment program is the presentation of a core narrative, their autobiography, to treatment staff and peers. Examining this form of prison-based treatment through the lens of narrative theory, I argue that the autobiographies and other stories that are developed and performed as part of this treatment process are largely the product of the imposition of this treatment schema in combination with dynamic group processes. Ironically, the treatment schema and the prevailing dynamics work to subvert the fundamental forensic goal of having inmates disclose aspects of their lives and crimes as an essential stepping stone toward rehabilitation. The narratives that emerge, both in detail and in meaning, cannot be seen as simply reflections of any single individual's life but, instead, as composites built on, and reflective of, cultural processes somewhat unique to the forensic context.

At distances larger than about 3 nm these effects originate predominantly from dipolar coupling. As these experiments are commonly performed in homogenous media, effects at the interface boundaries can be neglected. Nevertheless, the combination of such assays with single-molecule manipulation techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) requires a detailed understanding of the influence of interfaces on dipolar coupling effects. In the presented work we used a combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM)-AFM setup to elucidate this issue. We measured the fluorescence emission emanating from single quantum dots as a function of distance from the apex of a gold-coated cantilever tip. As well as fluorescence quenching at close proximity to the tip, we found a nonlinear and nonmonotonic distance dependence of the fluorescence emission. To confirm and interpret our findings we performed calculations on the basis of a simplified multiple multipole (MMP) approach, which successfully supports our experimental data.

The origins of this effect are difficult to explain in light of work suggesting predominantly weak outer-sphere type interactions between these ions and silica. Here we investigate the ability of M(II) aqua ions to promote the hydrolysis of Si-O bonded interactions relative to ion-free water using electronic structure methods. Reaction pathways for Si-O hydrolysis are calculated with the B3LYP and PBE1PBE density functionals at the 6-31G(d) and 6-311+G(d,p) levels in the presence of water, and both inner- and outer-sphere adsorption complexes of Mg(2+)(6H(2)O) and Ca(2+)(6H(2)O). All reaction trajectories involving hydrated ions are characterized by one or more surmountable barriers associated with the rearrangement of ion-associated water molecules, and a single formidable barrier corresponding to hydrolysis of the Si-O bonded interaction. The hydrolysis step for outer-sphere adsorption is slightly less favorable than the water-induced reaction. In contrast, the barrier opposing Si-O hydrolysis in the presence of inner-sphere species is generally reduced relative to the water-induced pathway, indicating that the formation of inner-sphere complexes may be prerequisite to the detachment of Si species from highly coordinated surface sites. The results suggest a two-part physical model for ion-promoted Si-O hydrolysis that is consistent with experimental rate measurements. First, a bond path is formed between the cation and a bridging oxygen site on the silica surface that weakens the surrounding Si-O interactions, making them more susceptible to attack by water. Second, Si-O hydrolysis occurs adjacent to these inner-sphere species in proportion to the frequency of ion-associated solvent reorganization events. Both processes are dependent upon the particular ion hydration environment, which suggests measured cation-specific demineralization rates arise from differential barriers opposing reorganization of ion-associated solvent molecules at the silica-water interface.",0,1140

The fabricated GMR reflector for red exhibits a high TE/TM polarization ratio of >10:1 and 80% optical reflectivity at resonant wavelength, while the GMR reflector for blue only allows 60% optical reflectivity and a degraded polarization ratio of 3:1 mainly due to high optical absorption of silicon.

Postoperatively, mice were allowed free cage activity without immobilization. Mice were humanely killed at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively. Repair site integrity was evaluated histologically through fibrocartilage formation and collagen fiber organization and biomechanically through load-to-failure testing of the supraspinatus tendon-bone construct.RESULTSAt 2 weeks, no differences were noted in percent area of fibrocartilage, collagen organization, or ultimate strength between groups. At 4 weeks, superior collagen fiber organization (based on collagen birefringence [17.3 ± 2.0 vs 7.0 ± 6.5 integrated density/μm2; P < .01]) and higher ultimate failure loads (3.5 ± 0.6 N vs 2.3 ± 1.1 N; P = .04) were seen in the KGN group.

Folding kinetics is tracked with ANS fluorescence intensity, usually interpreted as a reflection of protein structure-the hydrophobicity of the binding environments. Such simplistic view overlooks the complicated nature of ANS-protein complexes: the fluorescence characteristics are convoluted results of the ground state populational distribution of the probe-protein complex, the structural changes in the protein and the excited state photophysics of the probe. Understanding of the interplay of these aspects is crucial in accurate interpretation of the protein dynamics. In this work, the fluorescence decay of ANS complexed with apomyoglobin at different conformations denatured by pH is modeled. The fluorescence decay of the ANS-apomyoglobin complex contains information on not only apomyoglobin structure but also molecular populational distributions. The challenge in modeling fluorescence decay profiles originates from the convolution of heterogeneous binding and excited-state relaxation of the fluorescent probe. We analyzed frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime data of ANS-apomyoglobin with both maximum entropy methods (MEM) and nonlinear least squares methods (NLLS). MEM recovers a model of two expanding-and-merging lifetime distributions for ANS-apomyoglobin in the equilibrium transition from the native (N) through an intermediate (I-1) to the acid-unfolded state U(A). At pH 6.5 and above, when apomyoglobin is mostly populated at the N-state, ANS-apomyoglobin emits a predominant long-lifetime fluorescence from a relaxed charge transfer state S(1,CT) of ANS, and a short-lifetime fluorescence that is mainly from a nascent excited-state S(1,np) of ANS stabilized by the strong ANS-apomyoglobin interaction. Lowering the pH diminishes the contribution from the S(1,np) state. Meanwhile, more protein molecules become populated at the U(A) state, which exhibits a short lifetime that is not distinguishable from the S(1,np) state. At pH 3.4, when the population of the U(A) becomes significant, the short-lifetime fluorescence comes predominantly from ANS binding to the U(A). Further lowering the pH leads to more exposure of the bound ANS. The long lifetime shifts toward and finally merges with the short lifetime and becomes one broad distribution that stands for ANS binding to the U(A) below pH 2.4. The above expanding-and-merging model is consistent with F-statistic analysis of NLLS models. The consistency of this model with the knowledge from the literature, as well as the continuity of the decay parameters changing upon experimental conditions are also crucial in drawing the conclusions.",0,1145

In this work, we present a design of a simple and compact microfluidic device based on steady-state diffusion of the analyte, between two control channels where liquid is pumped through. The device generates a near-linear distribution of concentrations. We demonstrate this via experiments with dye solutions and comparison to finite-element numerical simulations. In a subsequent step, the device is combined with total internal reflection ellipsometry to study the adsorption of (cat)ions on silica surfaces from CsCl solutions at variable pH. Such a combined setup permits a fast determination of an adsorption isotherm. The measured optical thickness is compared to calculations from a triple layer model for the ion distribution, where surface complexation reactions of the silica are taken into account. Our results show a clear enhancement of the ion adsorption with increasing pH, which can be well described with reasonable values for the equilibrium constants of the surface reactions.",0,1146

Divalent cation is found to be an important factor that affects the NOM-induced membrane fouling process. In this work, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) coupled with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), assisted by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), is used to explore the contribution of Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), the two abundant divalent cations in natural water, to the UF membrane fouling caused by humic acid (HA) at a molecular level. The results show that Ca(2+) exhibited superior performance in accelerating fouling compared to Mg(2+). The hydrophobic polyethersulfone (PES) membrane exhibited greater complexation with HA in the presence of Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), compared to the hydrophilic cellulose membrane, as evidenced by the more intense polysaccharide C-O, aromatic C=C and carboxylic C=O bands in the FTIR spectra. The QCM and ITC measurements provide quantitative evidence to support that Ca(2+) was more effective than Mg(2+) in binding with HA and accumulating foulants on the membrane surfaces. The higher charge neutralization capacity and more favorable binding ability of Ca(2+) were found to be responsible for its greater contribution to the NOM-induced membrane fouling than Mg(2+). This work offers a new insight into the mechanism of cation-mediated NOM-induced membrane fouling process, and demonstrates that such an integrated ATR-FTIR/QCM/ITC approach could be a useful tool to explore other complicated interaction processes in natural and engineered environments.",0,1147

Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP.","Nanoparticles can form multiple bonds with target surfaces, thereby increasing adhesion strength and internalization rate into cells. This property has helped to drive interest in nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for drugs and imaging agents, but significant gaps in our understanding of multivalent adhesion make it difficult to control and optimize binding dynamics. In previous work, we experimentally observed that multivalent nanoparticle adhesion can exhibit a time-dependent detachment rate. However, simulations later indicated that the underlying cause was variability in the number of bonds that formed between individual nanoparticles within the population. Here, we use this insight to develop a simple model to isolate a series of constant detachment rates from such heterogeneous populations. Using simulations of experimental data to train the model, we first classified nanoparticles within a given population based on the most likely equilibrium bond number, which we termed the bond potential. We then assumed that each bond potential category would follow standard first-order kinetics with constant detachment rates. Model results matched the population binding data, but only if we further divided each bond potential category into two sub-components, the second of which did not detach. We then utilized bonding rates from the simulation to estimate detachment rates for the second, slower detaching sub-component. These results confirm our hypothesis that nanoparticle populations can be sub-divided based on bond potential, each of which could be characterized by a constant detachment rate. Finally, we established relationships between the new heterogeneous population detachment model and a time-dependent, empirical detachment model that we developed in previous work. This could make it possible to determine bond potential distributions directly from experimental data without computationally costly simulations, which will be explored in future work.",0,1148

However, in our previous work to establish a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, we found that laryngeal cancer-associated fibroblasts appeared to strongly inhibit the apoptosis of primarily cultured laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro. In this study, we investigated whether paired laryngeal cancer-associated fibroblasts alone can effectively support the growth of primarily cultured laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro. In all, 29 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma specimens were collected and primarily cultured. The laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells were separated from cancer-associated fibroblasts by differential trypsinization and continuously subcultured. Morphological changes of the cultured laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells were observed. Immunocytofluorescence was used to authenticate the identity of the cancer-associated fibroblasts and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the proportion of apoptotic cells. Western blot was used to detect the protein levels of caspase-3. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7, hepatocyte growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor 1 in the supernatants of the laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and control cells. AMD3100 (a chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 antagonist) and an anti-chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 antibody were used to block the tumor-supporting capacity of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Significant apoptotic changes were detected in the morphology of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells detached from cancer-associated fibroblasts. The percentage of apoptotic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells and the protein levels of caspase-3 increased gradually in subsequent subcultures. In contrast, no significant differences in the proliferation capacity of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells cocultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts were detected during subculturing. High level of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 was detected in the culture supernatant of cancer-associated fibroblasts. The tumor-supporting effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts was significantly inhibited by AMD3100.

Platinum coils were prepared by successive coating with cationic P(DLLA-co-TMC) and anionic heparin. Then, recombinant human VEGF-165 (rhVEGF) was immobilized by affinity binding to heparin. The morphological characteristics and sustained in vitro release of rhVEGF were examined using scanning electron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.

Experimental aneurysms were embolized with unmodified, P(DLLA-co-TMC)/heparin-coated or P(DLLA-co-TMC)/rhVEGF-coated platinum coils (n = 18). The coils were removed on days 15, 30 and 90 after insertion, and the histological and immunohistochemical analysis of factor VIII was performed to confirm the presence of endothelial cells in the organized area. In addition, the controlled in vivo release of VEGF was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. The release of VEGF tended to increase during the whole period and no burst release was observed. In the group treated with P(DLLA-co-TMC)/rhVEGF-coated platinum coils, clot organization and endothelial cell proliferation were accelerated. The immunohistochemistry study showed that the expression of factor VIII was found in the P(DLLA-co-TMC)/rhVEGF-coated coil group but not in the other two groups.

Physics in medicine and biology 45(8","The purpose of this work is to evaluate the EGS4/PRESTA electron multiple-scattering (MS) algorithms for dose calculation in intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) using a 90Sr/90Y source. The small source size and the small volume of interest in IVBT require very fine spatial resolution, which may break down the constraints of Molière's MS theory as implemented in EGS4. The theory is accurate only when the electron step sizes are large enough to allow the number of collisions omega0 to be much greater than e = 2.7183. When step sizes are too small to allow at least 2.7183 collisions, as may be necessitated by the fine geometry, the algorithm may switch off MS, producing dosimetric artefacts. This study showed that switching off MS could produce a dose deviation of up to 6% when the half-thickness (d/2) of the dose scoring region is comparable with the Moliere minimum step size (t(min) = 2.7183). The effect of switching off MS is negligible if d/2 >> t(min) For the case of omega0 > e, if the electron step sizes are chosen to allow five to 40 collisions, with increasing step size, the doses surrounding the source increase and the error decreases. On the other hand, when larger step sizes are chosen, the dose calculation voxel size must also be increased in order for the calculations to converge. A good compromise between accuracy and applicability for IVBT simulation can be made, if the thickness of the scoring region is 0.1 mm and the electron step sizes are in the range allowing 10 to 30 collisions.",0,1154

In some cases, an acid-catalyzed isomerization of the D(x,y)-CO(2) ions was found to take place. Adiabatic detachment energies of the resulting zwitterionic ions were measured and are well reproduced by theory. The relative stabilities of the D(x,y)-CO(2) decarboxylation products are largely determined by their intramolecular electrostatic interactions, which are directly probed by the photoelectron spectra and were analyzed in terms of the resulting Coulombic forces. Expulsion of carbon dioxide from the D(x,y) ions was also used as an electrostatic model to probe the mechanism of the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) to uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP). It was found that the loss of CO(2) from these zwitterions and from oxygen-protonated OMP is retarded by the presence of an additional anionic group.

Rumen fluid from 2 Holstein cows was mixed with McDougall's buffer in test tubes into which grass hay and concentrate containing a fiber source [cellulose (control), water-soluble CA (WSCA), or insoluble CA] had been placed. Each fiber source was supplemented at 10% of total substrate. Tubes were incubated for 24 h to determine fermentation and microbial parameters. Then, the dose response of these parameters to different supplementation levels of WSCA (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30%) was tested in the same manner. We also operated a continuous culture system with WSCA supplementation and evaluated the effects on digestibility, fermentation, and microbial parameters. The supplementation level of WSCA was set at 15% of total feed. In batch culture studies, WSCA, but not insoluble CA, yielded dose-dependent increases in ruminal acetate levels. In the continuous culture system study, WSCA yielded increases in ruminal acetate levels and in the abundance of bacteria of the genus Prevotella, including Prevotella ruminicola. Dry matter digestibility and total gas production were not affected. These results suggest that WSCA supplementation at 15% of total feed yielded increased acetate levels without negatively affecting feed digestion; these effects may reflect activation of Prevotella species.

Five papers report on approaches developed by researchers, and one paper on a community-led program; these case studies currently have little impact on decision making. Six papers provide examples involving water managers and researchers, and two papers provide examples involving water managers and the local community. There are no papers where researchers, managers and local communities all contribute equally to adaptive management. Successful adaptive management of environmental flows occurs more often than is perceived. The final paper explores why successes are rarely reported, suggesting a lack of emphasis on reflection on management practices. One major challenge is to increase the documentation of successful adaptive management, so that benefits of learning extend beyond the project where it takes place. Finally, moving towards greater involvement of all stakeholders is critical if we are to realize the benefits of adaptive management for improving outcomes from environmental flows.",0,1168

Early Intervention in Psychiatry 2(2","Despite its growing popularity there is a paucity of information exploring the potential of the Internet to build a trusted community that helps reduce stigma, facilitates help-seeking and aids in the prevention or helps in the management of mental health difficulties for young people. Unsupervised online forums or chat rooms hold potential dangers for young people including the possibility of attracting adults who may take advantage of vulnerable adolescents. Contagion with members organizing suicide pacts, or describing suicidal or self-harming intentions and methods and young people ruminating about feeling depressed are also potential risks. This paper describes the development and conceptual underpinnings of the Reach Out! Online Community Forum, a moderated bulletin board, developed in consultation with, and facilitated by young people aged 16-25. The Forum, although facilitated by young people, is supported and monitored by trained moderators. Anecdotal evidence collected via unsolicited feedback from young people using the Forum suggests that it is a positive, unique and helpful online experience although little is known about the impact on stigma reduction and help seeking in the offline world. Given the proliferation of unsupervised forums and chat rooms there is a need for further research to determine the effectiveness or potential dangers of online forums in mental health prevention and early intervention work.

Journal of microbiological methods 80(3","The study of bacterial communities in microbially-mediated water treatment systems is becoming increasingly popular. Aquatic bacterial communities are often found in fixed-film environments, residing within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances commonly referred to as a biofilm. A method for detaching the biofilm is required to either enumerate or characterize these bacterial communities. There are a variety of detachment methods including scraping, swabbing, shaking, sonication, blending, and digestion. The objective of this work was to develop an agitation-based protocol for detachment of culturable bacterial communities from the biofilm surrounding pea gravel from constructed wetland mesocosms. Three different protocol factors were systematically investigated using a triplicated 2(3) factorial design to determine the most effective detachment protocol. Factors studied included: the use of either tap water or phosphate buffer as the shaking/detachment solution; the use of either manual-shaking at room temperature or mechanical shaking at 30 degrees C; and the presence or absence of an enzyme cocktail consisting of lipase, beta-galactosidase and alpha-glucosidase. The resulting suspensions were evaluated for organics, inorganics, culturable bacteria, community level physiological profile (CLPP) and several BIOLOG ECO plate substrate related diversity indices. Using these metrics, the most effective shaking/detachment protocol was identified as mechanical shaking for 3h at 30 degrees C using a phosphate buffer with an enzyme cocktail.",0,1170

Cell experiments indicate that unlike PNIPAM polymer brushes reported with controllable detachment ability, HepG2, which is a human liver carcinoma cell line, remains adherent on the microgel films upon cooling. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments show an irreversible adsorption of serum proteins on the microgel surface upon cooling, whose adsorption is a prerequisite of cell adhesion during cell culture.

Guided family-centred care was developed to facilitate person-centred communication by bridging the gap between theory and practice in family-centred care. Main mechanisms of guided family-centred care are structured dialogue, reflection and person-centred communication.DESIGNQualitative and quantitative data were used to monitor participatory implementation of a systematic approach to training and certification of nurses delivering guided family-centred care.METHODSSystematic implementation of guided family-centred care included workshops, supervised delivery and certification. Evaluation and adjustment of nurse adherence to guided family-centred care was conducted by monitoring (1) knowledge, (2) delivery, (3) practice uptake and (4) certification.RESULTSImplementation was improved by the development of a strategic framework and by adjusting the framework according to the real-life context of a busy neonatal care unit. Promoting practice uptake was initially underestimated, but nurse guided family-centred care training was improved by increasing the visibility of the study in the unit, demonstrating intervention progress to the nurses and assuring a sense of ownership among nurse leaders and nonguided-family-centred-care-trained nurses.CONCLUSIONSAn adjusted framework for guided family-centred care implementation was successful in overcoming barriers and promoting facilitators.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEInsights gained from our pioneering work might help nurses in a similar context to reach their goals of improving family-centred care.",0,1172

Stress: The International Journal on the Biology of Stress.","Burnout, a pathological consequence of chronic work stress, shows an increasing incidence rate in industrialized countries. Previous findings indicate that burnout may be linked to a detachment of the negative association between subjectively appraised task demand and cognitive performance, which is typically seen in healthy individuals. The present study sought to confirm this relationship and to investigate whether this dissociation is mirrored in a biological marker of self-regulation, i.e., resting vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV). A heterogeneous sample (N = 65) of working adults (M age = 43.3, SD = 10; 23.1 % male) with varying degrees of burnout symptomatology completed three cognitive tasks (2-back, number-letter, and go/nogo) to assess different domains of executive functioning (updating, set-shifting, and inhibition), and respective demand ratings. Additionally, vagally mediated HRV at rest, operationalized as the root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD), was recorded. Burnout symptomatology moderated the association between subjective task difficulty and performance parameters of the go/nogo task, such that higher burnout scores were associated with reductions in the naturally occurring negative association between self-rated task demand and response inhibition. Intriguingly, this pattern was mirrored when replacing burnout with HRV. These findings suggest that burnout symptomatology, and individual differences in self-regulatory capacities (indexed by resting HRV), may alter one’s capacity for accurate task evaluation, a mechanism which could potentially underlie the dissociation between self-rated cognitive function and actual performance among individuals experiencing burnout.

In this work, we investigate the binding of Ca2+ to the carboxylic acid headgroup of palmitic acid (PA), a marine-abundant fatty acid, and the impact such binding has on the stability of PA monolayers in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. A range of Ca2+ conditions from 10 μM to 300 mM was utilized to represent the relative concentration of Ca2+ in high and low relative humidity aerosol environments. The CO2- stretching modes of PA detected by surface-sensitive infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) reveal ionic binding motifs of the Ca2+ ion to the carboxylate group with varying degrees of hydration. Surface tensiometry was used to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium spreading pressure (ESP) of PA on the various aqueous CaCl2 subphases. Up to concentrations of 1 mM Ca2+, each system reached equilibrium, and Ca2+:PA surface complexation gave rise to a lower energy state revealed by elevated surface pressures relative to water. We show that PA films are not thermodynamically stable at marine aerosol-relevant Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] ≥ 10 mM). IRRAS and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy were used to investigate the surface presence of PA on high concentration Ca2+ aqueous subphases. Non-equilibrium relaxation (NER) experiments were also conducted and monitored by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) to determine the effect of the Ca2+ ions on PA stability.

This study adds to this research by focusing on understanding this effect and the conditions under which this occurs.DESIGNCross-sectional survey study.METHODSParticipants were 244 nurses working in a large, metropolitan acute public hospital. They completed a questionnaire consisting of validated measures and provided information on frequency of participation and perceived usefulness of personal professional development activities. We analysed data using regression-based moderated mediation analyses.RESULTSThe relationship between frequency of participation in personal professional development activities and both perceived teamwork and performance was mediated by reflective thinking. Perceived usefulness of development activities moderated the relationship between frequency of participation in personal professional development activities and reflective thinking.CONCLUSIONOur results highlight the importance of professional development activities that go beyond knowledge- or skill-based training. Activities that cater to nurses' personal professional development needs are also associated with more positively perceived teamwork and performance. Results provide insights into the mediating mechanisms: Participation in personal professional development activities encouraged reflective thinking, which was associated with better perceived teamwork and performance. This association between personal professional development activities and reflective thinking was even stronger where nurses perceived the activities as useful.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICEPersonal professional development activities enhance reflection in and on practice as these activities were linked with higher perceived quality of care and teamworking.

Radical copolymerization of selected methacrylamide-based comonomer units tailored for amino acid residues surrounding the active site furnishes polymeric protein hosts that are able to inhibit enzymatic activity in a highly efficient dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 1.0 equiv approximately 0.7 microM). All binding site types on the polymer work cooperatively, using electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic forces, and substrate mimicry. In a native gel electrophoresis, the well-defined 2:1 complex (polymer/protein) migrates to the anode. Even at 250 mM NaCl, a 10-fold polymer excess is able to shut down bacterial cell wall degradation completely. A kinetic investigation points to a competitive mechanism (Lineweaver-Burk plots). CD spectra of pure Lysozyme and its polymer complex are indistinguishable; together with a total lack of preincubation time for maximum inhibition, experimental evidence is thus produced for a preserved tertiary enzyme structure-no denaturation occurs. Addition of the superior complexing agent polyarginine to the enzyme-polymer complex mildly detaches the inhibitor from the protein surface and leads to 90% recovery of enzymatic activity. Thus, Lysozyme could be turned off, on, and off again by consecutive addition of the polymeric inhibitor, polyarginine, and polymer again.",0,1177

The aim of the present work was to characterize the influence of prenylated polyphenols on model 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) membranes by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopies.

Polyphenols interacted mainly with glycerol backbone and acyl chain region of membrane. Magnitude of the induced effect correlated both with lipophilicity and molecular shape of the studied compounds. Elbow-shaped 8-PN and IXH were locked at polar-apolar region with their prenyl chains penetrating into hydrophobic part of the bilayer, while relatively planar XH molecule adopted linear shape that resulted in its deeper insertion into hydrophobic region. Additionally, by means of DSC and Laurdan fluorescence IXH was demonstrated to induce lateral phase separation in DPPC bilayers in gel-like state.

The diabatization relies on the permutational symmetry present in the methane molecule and results in diabatic states which transform as the three p orbitals of the X atom. Spin-orbit coupling is easily and accurately included using the atomic spin-orbit coupling matrix of the isolated X atom. The method is applied to the F + CH4 system obtaining an accurate PES for the entrance channel based on ab initio multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations. Comparing the resulting PESs with spin-orbit MRCI calculations, excellent agreement is found for the excited electronic states at all relevant geometries. The photodetachment spectrum of CH4·F(-) is investigated via full-dimensional (12D) quantum dynamics calculations on the coupled PESs using the multi-layer multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree approach.

We present the detection amplification technique through an attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectrum in the Kretschmann configuration. The system consists of a four-layer material, i.e., prism/Ag/Fe₃O₄@Au + biomaterial sample/air. The effective permittivity determination of the core-shell nanoparticle (Fe₃O₄@Au) and the composite (Fe₃O₄@Au + biomaterial sample) was done by applying the effective medium theory approximation, and the calculation of the reflectivity was carried out by varying the size of the core-shell, volume fraction and biomaterial sample.

The use of crossed polarizers is a very common approach for suppression of specular surface reflections. However, measurements are typically evaluated using a non-polarized scalar theory. The consequences of this discrepancy are the focus of our study, and we also quantify the related errors of the derived optical properties. We used polarized Monte Carlo simulations for forward calculation of the reflectance from different samples. The samples' scatterers are assumed to be spherical, allowing for the calculation of the scattering functions by Mie theory. From the forward calculations, the reduced scattering coefficient [Formula: see text] and the absorption coefficient μa were derived by means of a scalar theory, as commonly used. Here, we use the analytical solution of the scalar radiative transfer equation. With this evaluation approach, which does not consider polarization, we found large errors in [Formula: see text] and μa in the range of 25% and above. Furthermore, we investigated the applicability of the use of a reference measurement to reduce these errors as suggested in literature.

Appraisal is an essential component of revalidation. However as appraisal is developmental, and revalidation is summative, there is concern over the potential impact revalidation may have on the appraisal process itself.METHODSThis study, carried out among GPs in Wales, aimed to capture participants' perspectives of the initial impact of revalidation on appraisal. The study was commenced by conducting a basic literature review, building on existing research in this area. We employed a mixed method approach (an online survey and focus groups). The online survey was disseminated via Bristol Online Survey. Focus groups were carried out to examine the perspectives of both GP Appraisers and GPs on the study subject matter.RESULTSThe majority of respondents felt that revalidation had had a medium-sized effect on the appraisal process. Respondents were fairly evenly divided on the nature of that impact. Some reported collecting GMC-specified information had increased time costs. Others found that collecting this information had sparked reflection and changes to their practice. GPs were fairly evenly divided on the precise extent to which the GMC data collection offered an accurate picture of their work and learning. The majority felt that it did, with 20-23% reporting a negative impact.CONCLUSIONThe study participants reported that revalidation had impacted on appraisal, bringing increased time and costs alongside some increased individual reflection and Quality Improvement (QI) activity.

Among lizards, hexapods and arachnids, several lineages have evolved hairy foot pads that can generate strong friction and adhesion on both smooth and rough surfaces. A strongly expressed directionality of attachment structures results in an anisotropy of frictional properties, which might be crucial for attachment control. In a natural situation, more than one leg is usually in contact with the substrate. In order to understand the collective effect of hairy foot pads in the hunting spider Cupiennius salei (Arachnida, Ctenidae), we performed vertical pulling experiments combined with stepwise disabling of the pads. We found the attachment force of the spider to be not simply the sum of single leg forces because with leg pair deactivation a much greater decrease in attachment forces was found than was predicted by just the loss of available adhesive pad area. This indicates that overall adhesion ability of the spider is strongly dependent on the antagonistic work of opposing legs, and the apparent contact area plays only a minor role. It is concluded that the coordinated action of the legs is crucial for adhesion control and for fast and easy detachment. The cumulative effect of anisotropic fibrillar adhesive structures could be potentially interesting for biomimetic applications, such as novel gripping devices.",0,1190

Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual Conference 2011: 405-408.","This paper describes a new concept for measuring bone thickness via optically analyzing of hard tissue. In many surgical disciplines effecting bone treatment, like oral and maxillofacial surgery or otolaryngology, the knowledge of existing bone material is very important in order not to hurt anatomically sensitive structures. The existing bone material can be determined preoperatively using imaging procedures. However, the surgeon has no information about the residual bone thickness during the intervention. As a consequence of this, the distance between the tip of his instrument and sensitive structures is also unknown. Therefore, it would be very useful, if the bone thickness could be measured concurrently to the bone ablation. In this work, bone was irradiated with IR-Light and the reflection was detected. It would be examined, if there was an interrelation between bone thickness and reflection and how it could be measured. The results of the experiments show, that by means of this method it is possible to detect different bone thicknesses for a bone thickness < 1 mm.",0,1193

IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems 11(3","This paper presents a multi-polarization reconfigurable antenna with four dipole radiators for biomedical applications in body-centric wireless communication system (BWCS). The proposed multi-dipole antenna with switchable 0°, +45°, 90° and -45° linear polarizations is able to overcome the polarization mismatching and multi-path distortion in complex wireless channels as in BWCS. To realize this reconfigurable feature for the first time among all the reported antenna designs, we assembled four dipoles together with 45° rotated sequential arrangements. These dipoles are excited by the same feeding source provided by a ground tapered Balun. A metallic reflector is placed below the dipoles to generate a broadside radiation. By introducing eight PIN diodes as RF switches between the excitation source and the four dipoles, we can control a specific dipole to operate. As the results, 0°, +45°, 90° and -45° linear polarizations can be switched correspondingly to different operating dipoles. Experimental results agree with the simulation and show that the proposed antenna well works in all polarization modes with desirable electrical characteristics. The antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 34% from 2.2 to 3.1 GHz (for the reflection coefficient ≤ -10 dB) and exhibits a stable cardioid-shaped radiation pattern across the operating bandwidth with a peak gain of 5.2 dBi. To validate the effectiveness of the multi-dipole antenna for biomedical applications, we also designed a meandered PIFA as the implantable antenna. Finally, the communication link measurement shows that our proposed antenna is able to minimize the polarization mismatching and maintains the optimal communication link thanks to its polarization reconfigurability.",0,1194

Personality assessment can be integrated into psychiatric practice in a way that is practical and that has many benefits for the psychiatrist and his or her patients. Personal reflection on one's temperament and character profile promotes understanding without judging or blaming. The dialogue between psychiatrist and patient about personality promotes the rapid development of a therapeutic alliance based on mutual respect, positive regard, and shared goals. The expertise and empathy of the psychiatrist in knowing more about the person's strengths and vulnerabilities beyond even the person's own awareness builds respect, trust, and hope. In this way, the assessment of personality promotes recovery of well-being and reduces disease and stigma.

Although initially described as a direct myosin activator, subsequent studies are at odds with this description and do not explain OM-mediated increases in cardiac performance. Here we show, via single-molecule, biophysical experiments on cardiac myosin, that OM suppresses myosin's working stroke and prolongs actomyosin attachment 5-fold, which explains inhibitory actions of the drug observed in vitro. OM also causes the actin-detachment rate to become independent of both applied load and ATP concentration. Surprisingly, increased myocardial force output in the presence of OM can be explained by cooperative thin-filament activation by OM-inhibited myosin molecules. Selective suppression of myosin is an unanticipated route to muscle activation that may guide future development of therapeutic drugs.",0,1196

Our previous work has demonstrated that CM shows to activate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related adaptive unfolding protein response (UPR) activators. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)-related pathways play a protective role during the urografin (an ionic CM)-induced renal tubular injury. However, the involvement of ER stress-related apoptotic signals in the urografin-induced renal tubular cell injury remains unclear. Here, we examined by the in vivo and in vitro experiments to explore whether ER stress-regulated pro-apoptotic activators participate in urografin-induced renal injury. Urografin induced renal tubular dilation, tubular cells detachment, and necrosis in the kidneys of rats. The tubular apoptosis, ER stress-related pro-apoptotic transcriptional factors, and kidney injury marker-1 (kim-1) were also conspicuously up-regulated in urografin-treated rats. Furthermore, treatment of normal rat kidney (NRK)-52E tubular cells with urografin augmented the expressions of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Bax, caspase-12, JNK, and inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE) 1 signals. Urografin-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis was not reversed by the inhibitors of ATF-6, JNK signals or CHOP siRNA transfection, but it could be partially reversed by the inhibitor of caspase-12. Taken together, the present results and our previous findings suggest that exposure of CM/urografin activates the ER stress-regulated survival- and apoptosis-related signaling pathways in renal tubular cells.

There is a high prevalence of myopia, 80% to 90%, in young adults in East Asia; myopia has become the leading cause of blindness in this area. As the myopic population increases globally, the severity of its impact is predicted. Approximately one fifth of the myopic population has high myopia (≥-6 diopters), which results in irreversible vision loss such as retinal detachment, choroidal neovascularization, cataracts, glaucoma, and macular atrophy. The increasing prevalence of school myopia in the past few decades may be a result of gene-environment interactions. However, earlier school myopia onset would accompany faster myopia progression and greater risk of high myopia later in life. Recently, there have been effective interventions to delay the onset of myopia, such as outdoor activity and decreasing the duration of near work. Hyperopia (≤0.5 diopters) is a predictor of myopia. Pharmacological agents and optic interventions such as low-concentration atropine and orthokeratology may slow progression in myopic children. Novel surgeries and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs could deal with some myopic complications. From available evidence, the prevention, control, and treatment of myopia seem to be promising.

Major novel modifications included the use of a small infusion cannula, a 20-gauge blade for the creation of sclerotomies in the pars plicata, and a 23-gauge endoilluminator and vitreous cutter. Conjunctival dissection and suturing of sclerotomies were performed using this modified 3-port, 23-gauge vitrectomy technique. Anatomic success and surgical complications were analyzed.RESULTSTwenty-six eyes of 17 patients were included and analyzed. The mean (SD) gestational age was 28.0 (2.5) weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1199 (449) g. Mean postmenstrual age at the time of vitrectomy was 40.5 (3.0) weeks. Overall, 20 eyes (77%) achieved retinal attachment in a single operation, and 23 eyes (88%) achieved retinal attachment after multiple procedures. Postoperative complications included disc dragging (5 eyes [19%]), cataracts (4 [15%]), glaucoma (2 [8%]), persistent vitreous hemorrhage (1 [4%]), and posterior synechia (1 [4%]).CONCLUSIONSThis 23-gauge vitrectomy system seems to be a safe and effective approach for treatment of stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity.

A uniform mesoporous shell (pore size 4.7 nm) with a thickness of 55 nm and a cavity size of 345 nm is realized. The composite of paraffin mixed with 20 wt % PCHMs exhibits a minimum reflection coefficient (RCmin) of -84 dB at 8.2 GHz with a sample thickness of 3.9 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 4.8 GHz below -10 dB (>90% electromagnetic wave is attenuated). Moreover, the composite of phenolic resin mixed with 20 wt % PCHMs exhibits an ultrawide EAB of 8 GHz below -10 dB with a thinner thickness of 2.15 mm. Such excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties are ascribed to the large carbon-air interface in the mesoporous shell and interior void, which is favorable for the matching of characteristic impedance as compared with carbon hollow microspheres and carbon solid microspheres.

In present work, a nano-drug delivery system loading atorvastatin calcium (Ator) was developed for the efficient suppression of the metastasis of breast cancer. The nano-drug delivery system was constructed by a amphiphilic copolymer of methoxy polyethylene glycol-s-s-vitamin E succinate (mPEG-s-s-VES, PSV), which was consisted of a hydrophilic mPEG1k segment and a hydrophobic VES head, which were conjugated with a linker bearing amide and disulfide groups simultaneously. Self-assembly of PSV and Ator formed Ator-loaded PSV micelles (ASM) with good colloidal stability, high drug loading content (up to 50%) and great encapsulation efficiency (99.09 ± 0.28%). In cellular level, it was found that the ASM could efficiently release the Ator payload into cytosol due to detachment of PEG shell at high intracellular glutathione condition. ASM could significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of 4T1 breast cancer cells with inhibitory rates of 79.2% and 88.5%, respectively. In a 4T1 orthotropic mammary tumor metastatic cancer model, it was demonstrated that ASM could completely blocked the lung and liver metastasis of breast cancer with minimal toxicity owing to enhanced Ator accumulation in tumor and lung as compared with that of free Ator. The down-regulations of metastasis-promoting MMP-9, Twist and uPA proteins were demonstrated as the main underlying mechanism.

The presence of abundant surface amine groups makes these CDs be able to covalently link with the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), with an extremely high drug loading capacity (62.8%), while the surface hydroxyl groups ensure the good water-dispersibility of the CDs-DOX. Besides the use as a drug carrier, the fluorescent CDs also enable the dynamic tracing of the drug release process. When the CDs-DOX complexes were internalized by the human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), DOX could gradually detach from the surface of CDs and enter into the cell nucleus, while the CDs themselves still resided in the cytoplasm. In addition, the in vivo experiments showed that the CDs-DOX complexes exhibited a better tumor inhibition performance than free DOX molecules, which may be ascribed to the prolonged drug accumulation in tumor tissues. Furthermore, the as-synthesized CDs also exhibited negligible cytotoxicity/systemic side effects, and could successfully illuminate mammalian, bacterial and fungal cells, making them good candidates as not only drug delivery vehicles but also universal cell imaging reagents.

First, enzymatic degradation of the novel P(BS-co-CC) film samples was investigated with two enzymes of lipase B Candida Antartic (Novozyme 435) and lipase Porcine Pancreas PPL, and it was revealed that copolymerizing linear poly(butylene succinate) PBS with a functionalizable carbonate building block could remarkably accelerate the enzymatic degradation of a synthesized product P(BS-co-CC), and its biodegradation behavior was found to strongly depend on the overall impacts of several important factors as the cyclic carbonate (CC) comonomer structure and molar content, molar mass, thermal characteristics, morphology, the enzyme-substrate specificity, and so forth. Further, the biodegraded residual film samples and water-soluble enzymatic degradation products were allowed to be analyzed by means of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). On the experimental evidences, an exo-type mechanism of enzymatic chain hydrolysis preferentially occurring in the noncrystalline domains was suggested for the synthesized new P(BS-co-CC) film samples. With regard to their cell biocompatibilities, an assay with NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell was conducted using the novel synthesized P(BS-co-CC) films as substrates with respect to the cell adhesion and proliferation, and these new biodegradable P(BS-co-CC) samples were found to exhibit as low cell toxicity as the PLLA control, particularly the two samples of poly(butylene succinate-co-18.7 mol % dimethyl trimethylene carbonate) P(BS-co-18.7 mol % DMTMC) and poly(butylene succinate-co-21.9 mol % 5-benzyloxy trimethylene carbonate) P(BS-co-21.9 mol % BTMC) were interestingly found to show much better cell biocompatibilities than the PLLA reference.",0,1216

Surface bonded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers have been used for damage detection and parameter identification for various engineering structures over the last two decades. In this work, a reusable PZT transducer setup for monitoring initial hydration of concrete and structural health is developed, where a piece of PZT is bonded to an enclosure with two bolts tightened inside the holes drilled in the enclosure. An impedance analyzer is used to acquire the admittance signatures of the PZT. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) is employed to associate the change in concrete strength with changes in the PZT admittance signatures.

Biophysical journal 96(6","Coarse-grained Langevin molecular dynamics computer simulations were conducted for systems that mimic solutions of nucleosome core particles (NCPs). The NCP was modeled as a negatively charged spherical particle representing the complex of DNA and the globular part of the histones combined with attached strings of connected charged beads modeling the histone tails. The size, charge, and distribution of the tails relative to the core were built to match real NCPs. Three models of NCPs were constructed to represent different extents of covalent modification on the histone tails: (nonmodified) recombinant (rNCP), acetylated (aNCP), and acetylated and phosphorylated (paNCP). The simulation cell contained 10 NCPs in a dielectric continuum with explicit mobile counterions and added salt. The NCP-NCP interaction is decisively dependent on the modification state of the histone tails and on salt conditions. Increasing the monovalent salt concentration (KCl) from salt-free to physiological concentration leads to NCP aggregation in solution for rNCP, whereas NCP associates are observed only occasionally in the system of aNCPs. In the presence of divalent salt (Mg(2+)), rNCPs form dense stable aggregates, whereas aNCPs form aggregates less frequently. Aggregates are formed via histone-tail bridging and accumulation of counterions in the regions of NCP-NCP contacts. The paNCPs do not show NCP-NCP interaction upon addition of KCl or in the presence of Mg(2+). Simulations for systems with a gradual substitution of K(+) for Mg(2+), to mimic the Mg(2+) titration of an NCP solution, were performed. The rNCP system showed stronger aggregation that occurred at lower concentrations of added Mg(2+), compared to the aNCP system. Additional molecular dynamics simulations performed with a single NCP in the simulation cell showed that detachment of the tails from the NCP core was modest under a wide range of salt concentrations. This implies that salt-induced tail dissociation of the histone tails from the globular NCP is not in itself a major factor in NCP-NCP aggregation. The approximation of coarse-graining, with respect to the description of the NCP as a sphere with uniform charge distribution, was tested in control simulations. A more detailed description of the NCP did not change the main features of the results. Overall, the results of this work are in agreement with experimental data reported for NCP solutions and for chromatin arrays.",0,1218

In this present study, the natural phenomenon named autotomy, a self-defense mechanism employed by several animals against the toxic chemical contaminants, was considered to assess the toxicity of different chemical substances. We investigated the effects of glucose, sodium chloride, kanamycin, mercuric chloride, arsenic trioxide, and lead oxide on the phenotypes of earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae. Depending on the concentration of different chemicals, worms exhibit unique phenotypes. These phenotypes can be used to identify the toxicity as well as the toxic concentration of the chemicals. Upon exposure to toxic chemicals, worms use different mechanical forces at the site of cleavage furrow to detach its segments. During the detachment, there is no apparent blood loss at both the ends of the worm. Our results show that the mercuric chloride is toxic at the concentration above 5 mug when compared to other chemicals. Based on our findings, the toxic effects of a chemical and the toxic concentration of a chemical can be evaluated in both cost and time-efficient manner; in addition, these chemicals can be classified into the following categories: (1) mercuric chloride is extreme-toxic, (2) arsenic trioxide and lead oxide is toxic, (3) kanamycin and sodium chloride is low-toxic, and (4) glucose is non-toxic.",0,1223

The electronic structure and bonding properties of these clusters are additionally investigated at different levels of density functional theory. The most probable structures and ground state spin multiplicity for these cluster anions are tentatively assigned by comparing their theoretical first vertical detachment energies (VDEs) with their respective experiment values. The behavior of S and (SH) as ligands in these iron sulfide, hydrosulfide, and mixed sulfide/hydrosulfide cluster anions is investigated and compared. The experimental first VDEs for Fe(SH)1-3- cluster anions are lower than those found for their respective FeS1-3- cluster anions. The experimental first VDEs for FeS1-3- clusters are observed to increase for the first two S atoms bound to Fe-; however, due to the formation of an S-S bond for the FeS3- cluster, its first VDE is found to be ∼0.41 eV lower than the first VDE for the FeS2- cluster. The first VDEs of Fe(SH)1-3- cluster anions are observed to increase with the increasing numbers of SH groups. The calculated partial charges of the Fe atom for ground state FeS1-3- and Fe(SH)1-3- clusters are apparently related to and correlated with their determined first VDEs. The higher first VDE is correlated with a higher, more positive partial charge for the Fe atom of these cluster anions. Iron sulfide/hydrosulfide mixed cluster anions are also explored in this work: the first VDE for FeS(SH)- is lower than that for FeS2-, but higher than that for Fe(SH)2-; the first VDEs for FeS2(SH)- and FeS(SH)2- are close to that for FeS3-, but higher than that for Fe(SH)3-. The first VDEs of general iron sulfide, hydrosulfide, and mixed sulfide/hydrosulfide clusters [FeSm(SH)n-; m, n = 0-3, 0 < (m + n) ≤ 3] are dependent on three properties of these anions: 1. the partial charge on the Fe atom, 2. disulfide bond formation (S-S) in the cluster, and 3. the number of hydrosulfide ligands in the cluster.

Considering commonalities between depression and social anxiety and the presence of similar intrusive thoughts in social anxiety, the current study was designed to assess whether interference from irrelevant material in working memory is specific to depression or is also present in social anxiety disorder. Methods: To examine the effects of irrelevant emotional material on working memory performance, participants memorized two lists of words on each trial and were subsequently instructed to ignore one of the lists. Participants were then asked to indicate whether a probe word belonged to the relevant list or not. Results: Compared to control and social anxiety groups, the depression groups (both pure and comorbid with social anxiety disorder) exhibited greater difficulties removing irrelevant emotional material from working memory (i.e., greater intrusion effects). Greater intrusion effects were also associated with increased rumination. Limitations: Although we included three clinical groups (depression, social anxiety, and the comorbid groups), the results are based on a relatively small number of participants. Conclusions: The results indicate that difficulties removing irrelevant material from working memory might be unique to depression, and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information is relatively preserved in social anxiety disorder.

Quantitative models of cytoskeletal micromechanics and biochemistry require accurate estimates of local stress and flow conditions. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a computationally efficient fluid-structure interaction model based on operator splitting, to furnish this data. Cytosol volume conservation (as supported by experimental evidence) is enforced through an intermediate energy minimization step.

Family and friends generally focus on comforting and supporting the bereaved parents, unintentionally ignoring the bereaved grandparents. Grandmothers and grandfathers often struggle with wanting to help their adult children (deceased child's parents) without usurping the parents' responsibilities and decisions regarding the deceased child. Research on mothers' and grandmothers' health at about the same time after the same child's death in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care unit is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare mothers and grandmothers on physical health, mental health, and functioning in the first 1-6 months after the same child's death in a neonatal or pediatric intensive care unit. METHODS: This cross-sectional secondary analysis compared 32 mothers with 32 grandmothers of the same 32 deceased children (newborn-6 years). Grandmothers were recruited through these 32 mothers. Most grandmothers and mothers were Hispanic (25%, 34%) or Black (44%, 41%), respectively. Mothers and grandmothers separately completed questions about their Physical Health, Mental Health [depression (Beck Depression Inventory), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, Impact of Events-R), grief (Hogan Grief Reaction Checklist)], and Functioning (social support [MSPSS] and Employment) since the child's/grandchild's death. Paired t-tests and Chi Square tests were used to compare grandmothers with mothers of the same deceased infant/child on their private and separate responses to study measures. RESULTS: Mothers had significantly more acute illnesses than grandmothers. More mothers (63%) than grandmothers (37%) were categorized as clinically depressed. More mothers (69%) than grandmothers (44%) had clinical PTSD. Mothers reported significantly higher levels of despair and detachment than grandmothers. Only 4 mothers and 2 grandmothers were in therapy at the time of interview. Grandmothers and mothers rated their ability to concentrate on their work and their level of social support similarly.

Experiments clearly revealed one more spectral band at low electron binding energy for transition metal complexes with d electrons (M = V-Co) compared to those without d electrons (M = Al and Sc). Quantum chemical calculations suggested that all of the metal complexes possess hexacoordinated metal-ligand binding motifs, from which the calculated adiabatic/vertical detachment energy (ADE/VDE) and band gaps are in good agreement with experimental values. Direct spectrum and electronic structure analyses indicted that [EDTA·V(iii)]- can be easily oxidized to [EDTA·V(iv)] with the smallest ADE/VDE of 3.95/4.40 eV among these metal complexes, but further oxidation is hindered by the existence of a 2.30 eV band gap, a fact that accords with the special redox behavior of vanadium-containing species in biological cells.

Scleral thickness was determined by echography.PARTICIPANTS5 patients, 8 eyes.METHODSThe results of cataract surgery in nanophthalmic eyes were reviewed. Inclusion criteria was based on a clinical diagnosis of nanophthalmos and ocular surgery for cataract. Nanophthalmos was diagnosed according to a shorter than average axial length (usually less than 20.0 mm), typically a shallow anterior chamber, hyperopia, and scleral thickening greater than 1.5 mm. The procedure was planned as phacoemulsification, and foldable acrylic PCIOL implantation via a clear corneal tunnel.RESULTSThe procedure was planned as phacoemulsification. Six eyes had cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation by phacoemulsification. It was necessary to change the procedure to extracapsular cataract surgery in 2 cases because of uncontrolled shallowing of the anterior chamber. Postoperative trabeculectomy was needed in 1 eye, and Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was performed on 4 eyes. No postoperative uveal effusion or infections were seen in any of the eyes. Complications included iritis with posterior synechia (n = 1), transient choroidal hemorrhage (n = 1), vitreous loss (n = 1), posterior capsule opacity (n = 4), and glaucoma (n = 1). In 1 case retinal detachment developed 3 weeks postoperatively. Prophylactic laser iridoplasty or iridotomy was not performed for surgery.CONCLUSIONSAlthough phacoemulsification seems to be relatively safe in nanophthalmic patients without performing any prophylactic surgical procedure, surgeons need to be attentive of the challenges of working through them when performing phacoemulsification in these high-risk eyes. However, with careful preoperative evaluation and planning, complications can be avoided.",0,1236

JAMA ophthalmology 133(6","IMPORTANCEMyopia (nearsightedness) has its onset in childhood and affects about one-third of adults in the United States. Along with its high prevalence, myopia is expensive to correct and is associated with ocular diseases that include glaucoma and retinal detachment.OBJECTIVETo determine the best set of predictors for myopia onset in school-aged children.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThe Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Ethnicity and Refractive Error (CLEERE) Study was an observational cohort study of ocular development and myopia onset conducted at 5 clinical sites from September 1, 1989, through May 22, 2010. Data were collected from 4512 ethnically diverse, nonmyopic school-aged children from grades 1 through 8 (baseline grades 1 through 6) (ages 6 through 13 years [baseline, 6 through 11 years]).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESWe evaluated 13 candidate risk factors for their ability to predict the onset of myopia. Myopia onset was defined as -0.75 diopters or more of myopia in each principal meridian in the right eye as measured by cycloplegic autorefraction at any visit after baseline until grade 8 (age 13 years). We evaluated risk factors using odds ratios from discrete time survival analysis, the area under the curve, and cross validation.RESULTSA total of 414 children became myopic from grades 2 through 8 (ages 7 through 13 years). Of the 13 factors evaluated, 10 were associated with the risk for myopia onset (P < .05). Of these 10 factors, 8 retained their association in multivariate models: spherical equivalent refractive error at baseline, parental myopia, axial length, corneal power, crystalline lens power, ratio of accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A ratio), horizontal/vertical astigmatism magnitude, and visual activity. A less hyperopic/more myopic baseline refractive error was consistently associated with risk of myopia onset in multivariate models (odds ratios from 0.02 to 0.13, P < .001), while near work, time outdoors, and having myopic parents were not. Spherical equivalent refractive error was the single best predictive factor that performed as well as all 8 factors together, with an area under the curve (C statistic) ranging from 0.87 to 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79-0.99).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEFuture myopia can be predicted in a nonmyopic child using a simple, single measure of refractive error. Future trials for prevention of myopia should target the child with low hyperopia as the child at risk.",0,1237

Chemical Society reviews 43(22","Infrared absorption spectroscopy has proven to be one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques available for the characterization of catalytic systems. Although the history of IR absorption spectroscopy in catalysis is long, the technique continues to provide key fundamental information about a variety of catalysts and catalytic reactions, and to also offer novel options for the acquisition of new information on both reaction mechanisms and the nature of the solids used as catalysts. In this review, an overview is provided of the main contributions that have been derived from IR absorption spectroscopy studies of catalytic systems, and a discussion is included on new trends and new potential directions of research involving IR in catalysis. We start by briefly describing the power of Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) instruments and the main experimental IR setups available, namely, transmission (TIR), diffuse reflectance (DRIFTS), attenuated total reflection (ATR-IR), and reflection-absorption (RAIRS), for advancing research in catalysis. We then discuss the different environments under which IR characterization of catalysts is carried out, including in situ and operando studies of typical catalytic processes in gas-phase, research with model catalysts in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and so-called high-pressure cell instruments, and work involving liquid/solid interfaces. A presentation of the type of information extracted from IR data follows in terms of the identification of adsorbed intermediates, the characterization of the surfaces of the catalysts themselves, the quantitation of IR intensities to extract surface coverages, and the use of probe molecules to identify and titrate specific catalytic sites. Finally, the different options for carrying out kinetic studies with temporal resolution such as rapid-scan FTIR, step-scan FTIR, and the use of tunable lasers or synchrotron sources, and to obtain spatially resolved spectra, by sample rastering or by 2D imaging, are introduced.",0,1238

The Journal of biological chemistry 280(2","Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is highly expressed during inflammation and cellular transformation and promotes tumor progression and angiogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that endothelial cell COX-2 is required for integrin alphaVbeta3-dependent activation of Rac-1 and Cdc-42 and for endothelial cell spreading, migration, and angiogenesis (Dormond, O., Foletti, A., Paroz, C., and Ruegg, C.

In this study, we addressed the question of whether integrin-mediated cell adhesion may regulate COX-2 expression in endothelial cells. We report that cell detachment from the substrate caused rapid degradation of COX-2 protein in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) independent of serum stimulation. This effect was prevented by broad inhibition of cellular proteinases and by neutralizing lysosomal activity but not by inhibiting the proteasome. HUVEC adhesion to laminin, collagen I, fibronectin, or vitronectin induced rapid COX-2 protein expression with peak levels reached within 2 h and increased COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 production. In contrast, nonspecific adhesion to poly-L-lysine was ineffective in inducing COX-2 expression. Furthermore, the addition of matrix proteins in solution promoted COX-2 protein expression in suspended or poly-L-lysine-attached HUVEC. Adhesion-induced COX-2 expression was strongly suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38, extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, and, to a lesser extent, protein kinase C and by the inhibition of mRNA or protein synthesis. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that integrin-mediated cell adhesion and soluble integrin ligands contribute to maintaining COX-2 steady-state levels in endothelial cells by the combined prevention of lysosomal-dependent degradation and the stimulation of mRNA synthesis involving multiple signaling pathways.",0,1241

This protein was identified on the basis of both structural and functional evidence. The predicted sequence of the protein encoded by StMS1 shows a high degree of similarity to methionine synthases from other organisms and the expression of StMS1 in bacterial mutant strains restored the mutant's ability to synthesize methionine. Genomic organization and expression analyses suggest that StMS1 is a low-copy gene and is differentially expressed in potato organs. StMS1 expression was found in all tissues, but at elevated levels in flowers, basal levels in sink and source leaves, roots and stolons, and low levels in stems and tubers. RNA expression data were confirmed by western blot analysis except that the protein content in leaves was less than expected from the RNA data. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions revealed that the protein is located in the cytosol. However, the changing pattern of gene expression during the day/night period implied a light-dependent control of MS transcription normally seen for enzymes localized in plastids. The expression of MS was shown to be light-inducible with its highest expression at midday. These RNA data were not confirmed at the protein level since protein content levels remained constant over the whole day. Feeding experiments of detached leaves revealed that sucrose or sucrose-derived products are responsible for StMS1 induction. This induction can be blocked by treatment with DCMU during the light period. Western analysis revealed that the amount of StMS1 is not affected by either treatment.

Carefully designed experiments using H(2)- and D(2)-seeded helium carrier gas were used to study the electronic structure of Au(2)H(-) and Au(2)D(-) using photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations. Well-resolved photoelectron spectra with vibrational resolution were obtained for Au(2)H(-) and Au(2)D(-). Two isomers were observed both experimentally and theoretically.

Optical polarimetry is an approach that shows promise for refractive index estimation. However, this estimation often relies on polarimetric models that are limited to specular targets involving single surface scattering. Here, an analytic model is developed for the degree of polarization (DOP) associated with reflection from a rough surface that includes the effect of diffuse scattering. A multiplicative factor is derived to account for the diffuse component and evaluation of the model indicates that diffuse scattering can significantly affect the DOP values. The scattering model is used in a new approach for refractive index estimation from a series of DOP values that involves jointly estimating n, k, and ρ(d)with a nonlinear equation solver. The approach is shown to work well with simulation data and additive noise. When applied to laboratory-measured DOP values, the approach produces significantly improved index estimation results relative to reference values.",0,1247

Our results indicate that (a) simple augmentation of atom-centered diffuse functions is beneficial for the vertical detachment energy convergence, but it leads to very poor descriptions for the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions of the water cluster anions featuring a surface-bound excess electron and thus a significant ultraviolet spectrum redshift; (b) the ghost-atom-based floating diffuse functions can not only contribute to accurate electronic calculations of the ground state but also avoid poor and even incorrect descriptions of the SOMO and the LUMO induced by excessive augmentation of atom-centered diffuse functions; (c) the floating functions can be realized by ghost atoms and their positions could be determined through an optimization routine along the dipole moment vector direction. In addition, both the s- and p-type floating functions are necessary to supplement in the basis set which are responsible for the ground (s-type character) and excited (p-type character) states of the surface-bound excess electron, respectively.

The ECL-based DNA biosensor was fabricated by self-assembling the ECL probe of thiolated hairpin DNA tagged with ruthenium complex on the surface of a gold electrode. In the absence of target ss-DNA, the ECL probe immobilized on the surface of the electrode was in the folded configuration in which its termini were held in close proximity to the electrode, and thus a strong ECL signal could be generated. In the presence of target ss-DNA, a stem-loop of the ECL probe on the electrode was converted into a linear double-helix configuration due to hybridization, resulting in the tag moving away from the electrode surface, which in turn decreased the ECL signal. The ECL intensity of the DNA biosensor generated a ""switch off"" mode, which decreased with an increase of the concentration of target DNA, and a detection limit of 9 x 10(-11) M complementary target ss-DNA was achieved.

In this study, we investigated the potential role of fucoidan on EMT in RPE cells and its effect on the development of PVR. METHODS: MTS, Transwell, and collagen gel contraction assays were employed to measure the viability, migration, and contraction of RPE cells, respectively. mRNA and protein expression were evaluated via real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. In vivo, a pigmented rabbit model of PVR was established to examine the anti-PVR effect of fucoidan. RESULTS: Fucoidan reversed the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced EMT of RPE cells, including the increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and fibronectin and down-regulation of E-cadherin in human primary RPE cells. Moreover, the upregulation of phosphorylated Smad2/3 induced by TGF-beta1 was suppressed by fucoidan. Fucoidan also inhibited the migration and contraction of RPE cells induced by TGF-beta1.

Besides, the addition of TaN coatings greatly increased the hardness and modulus of pristine Ti from 2.54 ± 0.20 to 29.88 ± 2.59 GPa, and from 107.19 ± 6.98 to 295.46 ± 19.36 GPa, respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies indicated that TaN coating exhibited higher MIC resistance in comparison to bare Ti and TiN-coated coating in two bacteria-containing artificial saliva solutions. Moreover, the biofilm experiment showed that the TaN-decorated Ti sample possessed good antibacterial performance. The SEM and XPS results after biofilm removal demonstrated that TaN film remained its integrity and stability, while TiN layer detached from Ti surface in the bio-corrosion tests, demonstrating the anti-MIC behavior and the strong binding property of TaN coating to Ti substrate. Considering all these results, TaN-decorated Ti material exhibits the optimal comprehensive performance and holds great potential as implant material for dental applications.",0,1258

Biomech Model Mechanobiol 17(1","Cellular adhesion plays a critical role in biological systems and biomedical applications. Cell deformation and biophysical properties of adhesion molecules are of significance for the adhesion behavior. In the present work, dynamic adhesion of a deformable capsule to a planar substrate, in a linear shear flow, is numerically simulated to investigate the combined influence of membrane deformability (quantified by the capillary number) and bond formation/dissociation rates on the adhesion behavior. The computational model is based on the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method for the capsule-fluid interaction and a probabilistic adhesion model for the capsule-substrate interaction. Three distinct adhesion states, detachment, rolling adhesion and firm adhesion, are identified and presented in a state diagram as a function of capillary number and bond dissociation rate. The impact of bond formation rate on the state diagram is further investigated. Results show that the critical bond dissociation rate for the transition of rolling or firm adhesion to detachment is strongly related to the capsule deformability. At the rolling-adhesion state, smaller off rates are needed for larger capillary number to increase the rolling velocity and detach the capsule. In contrast, the critical off rate for firm-to-detach transition slightly increases with the capillary number. With smaller on rate, the effect of capsule deformability on the critical off rates is more pronounced and capsules with moderate deformability are prone to detach by the shear flow. Further increasing of on rate leads to large expansion of both rolling-adhesion and firm-adhesion regions. Even capsules with relatively large deformability can maintain stable rolling adhesion at certain off rate.",0,1259

The crystal structure and morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). FESEM and TEM measurements present that SnO2 nanorods were perpendicularly grown on the surfaces of Ni spheres and the density of the SnO2 nanorods could be tuned by simply varying the addition amount of Sn(2+) in this process. The morphology of Ni/SnO2 composites were also determined by the concentration of hydrochloric acid and a plausible formation mechanism of SnO2 nanorods-coated Ni spheres was proposed based on hydrochloric acid concentration dependent experiments. Ni/SnO2 composites exhibit better thermal stability than pristine Ni spheres based on thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA). The measurement on the electromagnetic (EM) parameters indicates that SnO2 nanorods can improve the impedance matching condition, which is beneficial for the improvement of electromagnetic wave absorption. When the coverage density of SnO2 nanorod is in an optimum state (diameter of 10 nm and length of about 40-50 nm), the optimal reflection loss (RL) of electromagnetic wave is -45.0 dB at 13.9 GHz and the effective bandwidth (RL below -10 dB) could reach to 3.8 GHz (12.3-16.1 GHz) with the absorber thickness of only 1.8 mm.

When the weight percentage of CoP loading is 3.4 wt % (g-C3 N4 /CoP-3.4 %), the highest H2 evolution amount of 8.4×102  μmol g-1 is obtained, which is 1.1×103  times than that over pure g-C3 N4 .

The interposition of calcium phosphate materials has been found to be able to enhance tendon-bone healing in knee ligament reconstruction. However, whether the interposition of these kinds of materials can enhance tendon-bone healing or even change the current nature of tendon-bone healing after RC repair still needs to be explored.HYPOTHESISThe interposition of calcium phosphate materials during RC repair would enhance tendon-bone healing or change its current nature of granulation tissue formation into a more favorable process.STUDY DESIGNControlled laboratory study.METHODSA total of 144 male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral detachment of the supraspinatus tendon, followed by delayed repair after 3 weeks. The animals were allocated into 1 of 3 groups: (1) repair alone, (2) repair with Ca5(PO4)2SiO4 (CPS) bioceramic interposition, or (3) repair with hydroxyapatite (HA) bioceramic interposition at the tendon-bone interface. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 4, or 8 weeks postoperatively, and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) was used to quantify the new bone formation at the repair site. New fibrocartilage formation and collagen organization at the tendon-bone interface was evaluated by histomorphometric analysis. Biomechanical testing of the supraspinatus tendon-bone complex was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way analysis of variance. Significance was set at P < .05.RESULTSThe micro-CT analysis demonstrated remarkable osteogenic activity and osteoconductivity to promote new bone formation and ingrowth of CPS and HA bioceramic, with CPS bioceramic showing better results than HA. Histological observations indicated that CPS bioceramic had excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. At early time points after the RC repair, CPS bioceramic significantly increased the area of fibrocartilage at the tendon-bone interface compared with the control and HA groups. Moreover, CPS and HA bioceramics had significantly improved collagen organization. Biomechanical tests indicated that the CPS and HA groups have greater ultimate load to failure and stiffness than the control group at 4 and 8 weeks, and the CPS specimens exhibited the maximum ultimate load to failure, stiffness, and stress of the healing enthesis.CONCLUSIONBoth CPS and HA bioceramics aid in cell attachment and proliferation and accelerate new bone formation, and CPS bioceramic has a more prominent effect on tendon-to-bone healing.CLINICAL RELEVANCELocal application of CPS and HA bioceramic at the tendon-bone interface shows promise in improving healing after rotator cuff tear repair.",0,1264

Lett. 134, 113902 (2007)], we reported a novel DNA separation method by tethering DNA chains to a solid surface and then stretching the DNA chains with an electric field. The anchor is such designed that the critical force to detach a DNA chain is independent of its length. Because the stretching force is proportional to the DNA net charge, a gradual increase of the electric field leads to size-based removal of the DNA strands from the surface and thus DNA separation. Originally proposed for separation of long double-stranded DNA chains (>10 000 bps), this method has been proven useful also for short single-stranded DNA fragments (<100 bases) for which the fluctuation force induced by the solvent becomes significant. Here we show that the fluctuation force can be approximately represented by a gaussian model for tethered DNA chains. Analytical expressions have been derived to account for the dependence of the fluctuation force on the surface confinement, the polymer chain length, and the DNA tethering potential.

The dye-labeled probe aptamer (PA) product was adsorbed onto the benzimidazole derivative-containing Cu-MOG via electrostatic incorporation and strong pi-pi stacking interactions, which significantly increased the FA value due to the enlargement of the molecular volume of the PA/Cu-MOG complex. With the introduction of target PSA, the FA value was obviously decreased on account of the specific recognition between PSA and PA which resulted in the detachment of PA from the surface of MOG.

Therefore in this work, particular attention is paid to the formation of enols in combustion flames. Starting with HO and propene (CH(3)CH=CH(2)), the reaction mechanism involving eight product channels has been investigated systematically. It is revealed that the electrophilic addition of OH to the double bond of CH(3)CH=CH(2) is unselective and the chemically activated adducts, CH(3)CHOH=CH(2) and CH(3)CH=CH(2)OH, may undergo dissociation in competition with H-abstractions. The kinetics and product branching ratios of the HO and propene reaction have been evaluated in the temperature range of 200-3000 K by Variflex code, based on the weak collision master equation/microcanonical variational RRKM theory. Available experimental kinetic data can be quantitatively reproduced by this study, with a minor adjustment (1.0 kcal/mol) of the OH central addition barrier. From the theoretical calculations with multiple reflection correction included, the total rate constant is fitted to k(t) = 6.07 x 10(-5)T(-2.54) exp(108/T) cm(3) x molecule(-1) x s(-1) in the range of 200-800 K and k(t) = 7.11 x 10(-23)T(3.38) exp(-1097/T) cm(3) x molecule(-1) x s(-1) in the range of 800-3000 K, which are in close agreement with experimental data.

Journal of biomechanical engineering 127(3","Most of the laser applications in medicine and biology involve thermal effects. The laser-tissue thermal interaction has therefore received more and more attentions in recent years. However, previous works were mainly focused on the case of laser heating on normal tissues (37 degrees C or above). To date, little is known on the mechanisms of laser heating on the frozen biological tissues. Several latest experimental investigations have demonstrated that lasers have great potentials in tissue cryopreservation. But the lack of theoretical interpretation limits its further application in this area. The present paper proposes a numerical model for the thawing of biological tissues caused by laser irradiation. The Monte Carlo approach and the effective heat capacity method are, respectively, employed to simulate the light propagation and solid-liquid phase change heat transfer. The proposed model has four important features: (1) the tissue is considered as a nonideal material, in which phase transition occurs over a wide temperature range; (2) the solid phase, transition phase, and the liquid phase have different thermophysical properties; (3) the variations in optical properties due to phase-change are also taken into consideration; and (4) the light distribution is changing continually with the advancement of the thawing fronts. To this end, 15 thawing-front geometric configurations are presented for the Monte Carlo simulation. The least-squares parabola fitting technique is applied to approximate the shape of the thawing front. And then, a detailed algorithm of calculating the photon reflection/refraction behaviors at the thawing front is described. Finally, we develop a coupled light/heat transport solution procedure for the laser-induced thawing of frozen tissues. The proposed model is compared with three test problems and good agreement is obtained. The calculated results show that the light reflectance/transmittance at the tissue surface are continually changing with the progression of the thawing fronts and that lasers provide a new heating method superior to conventional heating through surface conduction because it can achieve a uniform volumetric heating. Parametric studies are performed to test the influences of the optical properties of tissue on the thawing process. The proposed model is rather general in nature and therefore can be applied to other nonbiological problems as long as the materials are absorbing and scattering media.",0,1272

The ZnO growth mode was Stranski-Krastanov, which can be attributed to the ZnO layers initially adopting a non-polar structure with a lower surface tension before transitioning to the polar bulk structure with a higher surface energy.

Although there is a use for the test slide, there are many other components in the CLSM that need to be assessed. It would be useful if tests existed that produced reference values for machine performance. The aim of this research was to develop quality assurance tests to ensure that the CLSM was stable while delivering reproducible intensity measurements with excellent image quality.METHODSOur ultimate research objective was to quantify fluorescence using a CLSM. To achieve this goal, it is essential that the CLSM be stable while delivering known parameters of performance. Using Leica TCS-SP1 and TCS-4D systems, a number of tests have been devised to evaluate equipment performance. Tests measuring dichroic reflectivity, field illumination, lens performance, laser power output, spectral registration, axial resolution, laser stability, photomultiplier tube (PMT) reliability, and system noise were either incorporated from the literature or derived in our laboratory to measure performance. These tests are also applicable to other manufacturer's systems with minor modifications.RESULTSA preliminary report from our laboratory has addressed a number of the QA issues necessary to achieve CLSM performance. This report extends our initial work on the evaluation of CLSM system performance. Tests that were described previously have been modified and new tests involved in laser stability and sensitivity are described. The QA tests on the CLSM measured laser power, PMT function, dichroic reflection, spectral registration, axial registration, system noise and sensitivity, lens performance, and laser stability. Laser power stability varied between 3% and 30% due to various factors, which may include incompatibility of the fiber-optic polarization with laser polarization, thermal instability of the acoustical optical transmission filter (AOTF), and laser noise. The sensitivity of the system was measured using a 10-microm Spherotech bead and the PMTs were assessed with the CV concept (image noise). The maximum sensitivity obtainable on our TCS-SP1 system measured on the 10-microm Spherotech beads was approximately 4% for 488 nm, 2.5% for 568 nm, 20% for 647 nm, and 19% for 365 nm laser light. The values serve as a comparison to test machine sensitivity from the same or different manufacturers.CONCLUSIONSQA tests are described on the CLSM to assess performance and ensure that reproducing data are obtained. It is suggested strongly that these tests be used in place of a biological/histological sample to evaluate system performance. The tests are more specific and can recognize instrument functionality and problems better than a biological/histological sample. Utilization of this testing approach will eliminate the subjective assessment of the CLSM and may allow the data from different machines to be compared. These tests are essential if one is interested in making intensity measurements on experimental samples as well as obtaining the best signal detection and image resolution from a CLSM.

Harm Reduct J 15(1","BACKGROUND: In 2012, the World Health Organization recommended that needle and syringe programs offer their clients low dead space insulin syringes with permanently attached needles. However, in many countries, these syringes are not acceptable to a majority of people who inject drugs. This study assessed the feasibility of working with needle and syringe programs to implement the WHO recommendation using low dead space detachable needles. The study also assessed the acceptability of the needles. METHODS: Two needle and syringe programs in Tajikistan-one in Kulob and one in Khudjand-received 25,000 low dead space detachable needles each. The programs distributed low dead space detachable needles and a marketing flyer that emphasized the relative advantages of the needles. Each program also enrolled 100 participants, and each participant completed a baseline interview and a 2-month follow-up interview. RESULTS: At follow-up, 100% of participants reported trying the low dead space detachable needles, and 96% reported that they liked using the needles. Both needle and syringe programs distributed all their needles within the first 60 days of the project indicating use of the needles, even among clients who did not participate in the study. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that it is feasible for needle and syringe programs to offer and promote low dead space needles to their clients. The findings indicate that low dead space needles are acceptable to needle and syringe program clients in these Tajikistan cities. To reduce HIV and hepatitis C virus transmission, needle and syringe programs should offer low dead space needles, low dead space insulin syringes in addition to standard needles, and syringes to their clients.",0,1278

In order to prove the feasibility analysis towards a fully automated optical assay, an engineered system was developed to simultaneously manipulate and interrogate multiple fiber optic optrodes in the different phases of the assay. The automated system tested in AmpC solutions at increasing concentrations demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 6 nM, three times better when compared with the results obtained in our previous work. Moreover, the real effectiveness of the proposed optical assay has been also confirmed in complex matrices as the case of lysates of Escherichia coli overexpressing AmpC.",0,1279

1282,"Adil, M., et al. (2018"," ""Experimental study on electromagnetic-assisted ZnO nanofluid flooding for enhanced oil recovery (EOR","Recently, nano-EOR has emerged as a new frontier for improved and enhanced oil recovery (IOR & EOR). Despite their benefits, the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate at reservoir conditions which cause their detachment from the oil/water interface, and are consequently retained rather than transported through a porous medium. Dielectric nanoparticles including ZnO have been proposed to be a good replacement for EOR due to their high melting point and thermal properties. But more importantly, these particles can be polarized under electromagnetic (EM) irradiation, which provides an innovative smart Nano-EOR process denoted as EM-Assisted Nano-EOR. In this study, parameters involved in the oil recovery mechanism under EM waves, such as reducing mobility ratio, lowering interfacial tensions (IFT) and altering wettability were investigated. Two-phase displacement experiments were performed in sandpacks under the water-wet condition at 95 degrees C, with permeability in the range of 265-300 mD. A crude oil from Tapis oil field was employed; while ZnO nanofluids of two different particle sizes (55.7 and 117.1 nm) were prepared using 0.1 wt. % nanoparticles that dispersed into brine (3 wt. % NaCl) along with SDBS as a dispersant. In each flooding scheme, three injection sequential scenarios have been conducted: (i) brine flooding as a secondary process, (ii) surfactant/nano/EM-assisted nano flooding, and (iii) second brine flooding to flush nanoparticles. Compare with surfactant flooding (2% original oil in place/OOIP) as tertiary recovery, nano flooding almost reaches 8.5-10.2% of OOIP. On the other hand, EM-assisted nano flooding provides an incremental oil recovery of approximately 9-10.4% of OOIP. By evaluating the contact angle and interfacial tension, it was established that the degree of IFT reduction plays a governing role in the oil displacement mechanism via nano-EOR, compare to mobility ratio. These results reveal a promising way to employ water-based ZnO nanofluid for enhanced oil recovery purposes at a relatively high reservoir temperature.",0,1282

(2018"," ""Posture-motor and posture-ideomotor dual-tasking: A putative marker of psychomotor retardation and depressive rumination in patients with major depressive disorder."" Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 12.","Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that the assessment of postural performance may be a potentially reliable and objective marker of the psychomotor retardation (PMR) in the major depressive disorder (MDD). One of the important facets of MDD-related PMR is reflected in disrupted central mechanisms of psychomotor control, heavily influenced by compelling maladaptive depressive rumination. In view of this we designed a research paradigm that included sequential execution of simple single-posture task followed by more challenging divided attention posture tasks, involving concurring motor and ideomotor workloads. Another difficulty dimension assumed executing of all the tasks with eyes open (EO) (easy) and closed (EC) (difficult) conditions. We aimed at investigating the interplay between the severity of MDD, depressive rumination, and efficiency of postural performance. Methods: Compared with 24 age- and body mass index-matched healthy controls (HCs), 26 patients with MDD sequentially executed three experimental tasks: (1) single-posture task of maintaining a quiet stance (ST), (2) actual posture-motor dual task (AMT); and (3) mental/imaginary posture-motor dual task (MMT). All the tasks were performed in the EO and the EC conditions. The primary dependent variable was the amount of kinetic energy (E) expended for the center of pressure deviations (CoPDs), whereas the absolute divided attention cost index showed energy cost to the dual-tasking vs. the single-posture task according to the formula: ΔE = (EDual-task—ESingle-task). Results: The signs of PMR in the MDD group were objectively indexed by deficient posture control in the EC condition along with overall slowness of fine motor and ideomotor activity. Another important and probably more challenging feature of the findings was that the posture deficit manifested in the ST condition was substantially and significantly attenuated in the MMT and AMT performance dual-tasking activity. A multiple linear regression analysis evidenced further that the dual-tasking energy cost (i.e., ΔE) significantly predicted clinical scores of severity of MDD and depressive rumination. Conclusion: The findings allow to suggest that execution of concurrent actual or imaginary fine motor task with closed visual input deallocates attentional resources from compelling maladaptive depressive rumination thereby attenuating severity of absolute dual-tasking energy costs for balance maintenance in patients with MDD. Significance: Quantitative assessment of PMR through measures of the postural performance in dual-tasking may be useful to capture the negative impact of past depressive episodes, optimize the personalized treatment selection, and improve the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MDD.

BMC medical education 13: 64.","BACKGROUNDMal-distribution of the health workforce with a strong bias for urban living is a major constraint to expanding midwifery services in Ghana. According to the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG) report, the high risk of dying in pregnancy or childbirth continues in Africa. Maternal death is currently estimated at 350 per 100,000, partially a reflection of the low rates of professional support during birth. Many women in rural areas of Ghana give birth alone or with a non-skilled attendant. Midwives are key healthcare providers in achieving the MDGs, specifically in reducing maternal mortality by three-quarters and reducing by two-thirds the under 5 child mortality rate by 2015.METHODSThis quantitative research study used a computerized structured survey containing a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify the importance of different incentives and policies to encourage service to deprived, rural and remote areas by upper-year midwifery students following graduation. Using a hierarchical Bayes procedure we estimated individual and mean utility parameters for two hundred and ninety eight third year midwifery students from two of the largest midwifery training schools in Ghana.RESULTSMidwifery students in our sample identified: 1) study leave after two years of rural service; 2) an advanced work environment with reliable electricity, appropriate technology and a constant drug supply; and 3) superior housing (2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, kitchen, living room, not shared) as the top three motivating factors to accept a rural posting.CONCLUSIONAddressing the motivating factors for rural postings among midwifery students who are about to graduate and enter the workforce could significantly contribute to the current mal-distribution of the health workforce.",0,1284

The paradigm of personality psychopathology is shifting from one that is purely categorical in nature to one grounded in dimensional individual differences. Section III (Emerging Measures and Models) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM–5]; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), for example, includes a hybrid categorical/dimensional model of personality disorder classification. To inform the hybrid model, the DSM–5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group developed a self-report instrument to assess pathological personality traits—the Personality Inventory for the DSM–5 (PID–5). Since its recent introduction, 30 papers (39 samples) have been published examining various aspects of its psychometric properties. In this article, we review the psychometric characteristics of the PID–5 using the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing as our framework. The PID–5 demonstrates adequate psychometric properties, including a replicable factor structure, convergence with existing personality instruments, and expected associations with broadly conceptualized clinical constructs. More research is needed with specific consideration to clinical utility, additional forms of reliability and validity, relations with psychopathological personality traits using clinical samples, alternative methods of criterion validation, effective employment of cut scores, and the inclusion of validity scales to propel this movement forward.

An Australian program to develop teaching aged care facilities is being undertaken to build the sector's capacity and provide nursing students with positive experiences of engaging with vulnerable clients. This research aimed to examine care staff potential to facilitate nursing student engagement with clinically relevant knowledge in the performance of hygiene care in a residential aged care facility.METHODSThis study was designed as an action research study. A cycle of reflection, planning, action, and evaluation is described to illustrate the carer mentor capacity to engage with and contribute to the learning of nursing students. Participants were second year student nurses (n = 10) on a four-week placement in a Tasmanian aged care facility in 2013 and their nurse/carer mentors (n = 17). Mentors participated in six action research meetings, and nursing students engaged in a parallel series of four feedback meetings during the placement.RESULTSAt the beginning of the placement, nursing students exhibited a disregard for the clinical value of care provision. Students considered provision of hygiene care, in particular, the preserve of care workers and an inappropriate training exercise in the context of an undergraduate nursing qualification. To assist students to make links between core nursing competencies and hygiene care as well as to engender respect for their role within the aged care facility, carer mentors developed the Carer Assessment and Reporting Guide. Once implemented during the final weeks of the placement, the Guide improved student perceptions of resident hygiene care (reframed as assessment) and the role of facility care workers, as well as reinforcing carer self-esteem.CONCLUSIONHygiene care is replete with nursing competencies that are valuable for undergraduate learners, including assessments of skin integrity, mobility, cognitive function, bowels and urine, and basic hygiene.

However, the performance of the existing FO-SPR instruments mainly depends on the device surface condition and in particular on the structural aspect of the thin gold (Au) plasmonic film deposited on the FO substrate. In this work, a simple cost-effective colloidal lithography technique (CLT) was adapted and applied for the first time to the micrometer-sized FO substrate, to design end reflection-type FO-SPR sensors with periodic arrays of Au triangularly-shaped nanostructures on the Au mirror FO tip distal end. The nanopatterned FO-SPR sensor tips were afterwards subjected to refractometric measurements in a sucrose dilution series and subsequently compared with their non-patterned counterparts. It was observed that the spectral dips of the nanopatterned FO-SPR sensor tips were shifted towards longer wavelengths after CLT patterning. Moreover, the sensor sensitivity was improved with up to 25% compared to the conventional non-patterned FO-SPR devices.

A total of 22,296 myopic eyes that underwent surgical correction of myopia ≤ -10.00 D were included. LASIK for the correction of myopia was performed in all eyes. Patients were followed for 10 years after LASIK. The clinical charts of patients that developed rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) after LASIK were reviewed.RESULTSA total of 11,594 (52%) eyes came back for follow-up after LASIK at 10 years. Twenty-two eyes (19 patients) developed a RRD after LASIK at 10 years. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments occurred between 1 month and 10 years (mean: 31.6 ± 39.3 months) after LASIK. Eyes that developed a RRD had from -1.50 to -9.75 D of myopia (mean: -4.81 ± 2.2 D) before LASIK. The frequency of RRD after LASIK determined in our study was 0.05% (11/22,296) at 1 year, 0.15% (18/11,371) at 5 years, and 0.19% (22/11,594) at 10 years.CONCLUSIONSRhegmatogenous retinal detachment after LASIK for the correction of myopia ≤ -10.00 D is infrequent. The risk of RRD after LASIK is very low if you screen patients, and do prophylactic treatment as performed in this study. RRD, if managed promptly, will result in good vision.

The authors then selected a high-resolution eye-tracker built in to a 17-inch computer monitor that is capable of recording gaze differences with resolution of 1° of visual angle. This system enables one to investigate surgeons' eye-hand coordination on the surgical monitor in the laboratory environment. However, the limited effective tracking distance restricts the use of this system in the dynamic environment in the real OR. Another eye-tracker system was found with equally high level of resolution but with more flexibility on the tracking distance, as the eye-tracker camera was detached from the monitor. With this system, the surgeon's gaze during 11 laparoscopic procedures in the OR was recorded successfully. There were many logistical challenges with unobtrusively integrating the eye-tracking equipment into the regular OR workflow and data processing issues in the form of image compatibility and data validation. The experiences and solutions to these challenges are discussed.",0,1298

European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe 22(3",INTRODUCTIONMany societies have observed a steady increase of many older adults living longer due to advancements in health and standard of living. The dental team requires specialised training in gerodontology to better prepare for the future needs of the elderly patients. It is the aim of this study to report the undergraduate students' activities and perspectives on their work experience in a geriatric residence.MATERIALS AND METHODSAn anonymous online questionnaire on the theoretical and practical aspects of training was sent to students in dentistry and dental hygiene (DH) undergraduate courses. Students were also invited to discuss their experiences. Data of clinical treatment performed by the students were collected. The number of clinical hours of student exposure to patients was measured.RESULTSCompletion of the questionnaire was high (90%). Both DH and dentistry students have in excess of 100 hours/y of clinical practice. Overall students rate their experience as a positive one that enriches patients' well-being. However they identify barriers to oral health and experience challenges related to their clinical work and level of competence (Kruskal-Wallis Test P < .05).CONCLUSIONSstudy participants were strongly motivated towards the management of frail older adults and cognisant of the barriers and constraints of achieving a reasonable level of oral health. Gerodontology programmes should be adaptable in order to create the appropriate environment and address socio-emotional challenges experienced by students.,0,1299

In the present work, diverse spectroscopic and microscopic methods were applied to characterize model biosensor surfaces, formed on Si(3)N(4) or SiO(2) by modification with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, coating with rabbit gamma-globulins (IgGs) through physical adsorption, blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and specific binding of an anti-rabbit IgG antibody. In addition, silanized substrates with directly adsorbed BSA or anti-rabbit IgG antibody were examined as reference surfaces. The protein/amino-organosilane/silicon structure of all surfaces was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Homogeneity of protein coverage was verified with near-field scanning optical microscope, working in reflection and fluorescence mode. Surface coverage with proteins was determined with angle-resolved XPS using a previously established bilayer approach. Inner structure of protein layers was examined with atomic force microscopy. Vertical arrangement of carbon functional groups was revealed by high resolution ARXPS. Combined spectroscopic and microscopic data reveal the complex character of interactions with the immobilized IgG molecules during blocking with BSA and immunoreaction with anti-IgG antibody. Within experimental error, neither surface coverage nor lateral structural scales of protein layer (provided by Fourier and auto-correlation analysis of topographic and phase images) increase during blocking procedure. On the other hand, coverage and all structural measures rise considerably after immunoreaction. In addition, it was found that polar functional groups orient towards substrate for all protein layers, independently of coverage, prior to and after both blocking and specific binding.",0,1300

One cause of this is heavy load related work activities such as manual handling, in which the quality of individual work technique may play a major role. Preventive interventions and well-defined educational strategies to support movement awareness and long-lasting movement changes need to be developed. The aim of the present study was to explore nursing students' experiences of a newly developed interactive learning model for movement awareness. The learning model, which is based on a life-world perspective with focus on interpersonal interaction, has been used with 11 undergraduate students from the second and final year. Each student participated in three individual video sessions with a facilitator. Two individual interviews were carried out with each student during the learning process and one interview 12-18 months after the last session. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, and a phenomenological hermeneutic method inspired by Paul Ricoeur and described by Lindseth and Norberg was used to interpret the interviews and diary notes. The interpretation resulted in three key themes and nine subthemes. The key themes were; ""Obtaining better preconditions for bodily awareness,"" ""Experiencing changes in one's own movement,"" and ""Experiencing challenges in the learning process."" The interactive learning model entails a powerful and challenging experience that develops movement awareness. The experience of meaningfulness and usefulness emerges increasingly and alternates with a feeling of discomfort. The learning model may contribute to the body of knowledge of well-defined educational strategies in movement awareness and learning in, for example, preventive interventions and ergonomic education. It may also be valuable in other practical learning situations where movement awareness is required.",0,1301

Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research 12(12","BACKGROUNDResearch has found that patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy is crucial to treatment success, but this research did not investigate the patient's viewpoint. This study examined relationships between types of adherence and coping, psychosocial factors, quality of life (QoL), and physical symptoms from the perspective of people living with HIV/AIDS.MATERIAL/METHODSThe quantitative study involved 100 HIV-positive participants. Questionnaires comprised the Trier Scales on Coping with Physical Illness, Medical-Outcomes-Study HIV Health-Survey QoL, Social Factors of Antiretroviral Therapy, and the HIV/AIDS Physical Symptom-Checklist. A sub-sample of 41 participants underwent semi-standardized interviews eliciting the type of adherence. Grounded Theory was the method of qualitative analyses.RESULTSMaladaptive coping (rumination) related to poor mental health (p<0.001), concealing the HIV-infection (p<0.01), and being treatment-naive (p<0.01). Spiritual coping was more likely in women (p<0.001). Overall, QoL was worse in participants with more physical symptoms (p<0.001) and in those seeking mental health care (p<0.001). Working and maintaining a regular daily routine were associated with better adherence (p<0.05). Four adherence types were identified: 'Traditional Adherence' (with indifferent, faithful, and anxious subtypes), 'Traditional Non-Adherence', 'Critical Adherence', and 'Critical Non-Adherence'. The traditional types underscored a paternalistic medical model, while critical types emphasized 'autonomous patients'. Critical types were less frequent (39%), although superior to traditional types (p<0.001) in internal locus of control, optimal social support, and adaptive coping.CONCLUSIONSCritical adherence is superior to traditional adherence with respect to physical and psychosocial factors. Strategies to improve adherence should therefore target empowerment and autonomy rather than patient obedience.",0,1302

Using grounded theory, theme extraction was performed with interdisciplinary input (medicine, sociology, and theology), yielding a high inter-rater reliability score (kappa = 0.75).RESULTSThree domains emerged where religion and spirituality appear as a factor in medical training. First, religion/spirituality may present unique challenges and benefits in relation to the hidden curriculum. Religious/spiritual respondents more often reported to struggle with issues of personal identity, increased self-doubt, and perceived medical knowledge inadequacy. However, religious/spiritual participants less often described relationship conflicts within the medical team, work-life imbalance, and emotional stress arising from patient suffering. Second, religion/spirituality may influence coping strategies during encounters with patient suffering. Religious/spiritual trainees described using prayer, faith, and compassion as means for coping whereas nonreligious/nonspiritual trainees discussed compartmentalization and emotional repression. Third, levels of religion/spirituality appear to fluctuate in relation to medical training, with many trainees experiencing an increase in religiousness/spirituality during training.CONCLUSIONReligion/spirituality has a largely unstudied but possibly influential role in medical student socialization.

With recent advances in modern technology, scientists have started analyzing not only the ridge patterns of fingerprints but also substances which can be found within them. The aim of this work was to determine whether Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectromicroscopy could be used to detect contamination in a fingerprint which was dusted with powder (a technique already recognized as an effective and reliable method for developing latent fingerprints) and subsequently lifted off with adhesive tape. Explosive materials (pentaerythritol tetranitrate, C-4, TNT) and noncontrolled substances (sugar, aspirin) were used to prepare contaminated fingerprints on various substrates. Freshly deposited fingermarks with powders which were lifted off with adhesive tapes (provided by Singapore Police Force) were analyzed using a Bruker Hyperion 2000 microscope at the ISMI beamline (Singapore Synchrotron Light Source) with an attenuated total reflection objective. FTIR spectroscopy is a nondestructive technique which requires almost no sample preparation. Further, the fingerprint under analysis remains in pristine condition, allowing subsequent analysis if necessary. All analyzed substances were successfully distinguished using their FTIR spectra in powdered and lifted fingerprints. This method has the potential to significantly impact forensic science by greatly enhancing the information that can be obtained from the study of fingerprints.",0,1304

Focus groups were conducted with 25 Harvard Medical School (HMS) students, and interviews were conducted with 8 HMS faculty members. Five major themes emerged as important in shaping students' medical training experiences. First, students and faculty discussed the overall significance of the hidden curriculum in terms of the hierarchy of medicine, behavioral modeling, and the value placed on research versus clinical work. Second, respondents articulated values modeled in medicine. Third, students and faculty reflected on changes in student development during their training, particularly in terms of changes in empathy and compassion. Fourth, respondents discussed challenges faced in medical school including professional clinical education and the psychosocial aspects of medical training. Finally, students and faculty articulated a number of coping mechanisms to mitigate these challenges including reflection, prayer, repression, support systems, creative outlets, exercise, and separation from one's work. The results from this study suggest the significance of the hidden curriculum on medical students throughout their training, as they learn to navigate challenging and emotional experiences.

PloS one 9(11","Background: Diagnosis and management of depression occurs frequently in the primary care setting. Current diagnostic and management of treatment practices across clinical populations focus on eliminating signs and symptoms of depression. However, there is debate that some interventions may pathologize normal, adaptive responses to stressors. Analytical rumination (AR) is an example of an adaptive response of depression that is characterized by enhanced cognitive function to help an individual focus on, analyze, and solve problems. To date, research on AR has been hampered by the lack of theoretically-derived and psychometrically sound instruments. This study developed and tested a clinically meaningful measure of AR. Methods: Using expert panels and an extensive literature review, we developed a conceptual framework for AR and 22 candidate items. Items were field tested to 579 young adults; 140 of whom completed the items at a second time point. We used Rasch measurement methods to construct and test the item set; and traditional psychometric analyses to compare items to existing rating scales. Results: Data were high quality (,1% missing; high reliability: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92, test-retest intraclass correlations .0.81; evidence for divergent validity). Evidence of misfit for 2 items suggested that a 20-item scale with 4-point response categories best captured the concept of AR, fitting the Rasch model (x² = 95.26; df = 76, p = 0.07), with high reliability (rp = 0.86), ordered response scale structure, and no item bias (gender, age, time). Conclusion: Our study provides evidence for a 20-item Analytical Rumination Questionnaire (ARQ) that can be used to quantify AR in adults who experience symptoms of depression. The ARQ is psychometrically robust and a clinically useful tool for the assessment and improvement of depression in the primary care setting. Future work is needed to establish the validity of this measure in people with major depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1308

Few papers directly explored recommendations for topics although suggestions related to common areas of error and gaps in knowledge or skill.

In high-income countries (HICs) cancer is the commonest cause of disease-related death in AYAs, though overall 5-year survival rates now exceed 80%. A very different circumstance likely holds in LMICs, but accurate assessments are not readily available.Breast cancer accounts for 40% of tumours in female AYAs and this age group includes the peak incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma. The late Professor Gianni Bonadonna contributed importantly to improved survival in patients with these two diseases.

Episodes of mind-wandering, where personal thoughts often go unnoticed for some time before being introspected, offer a unique opportunity to study the role of language in introspection. In this paper, we show that inner speech facilitates awareness of mind-wandering. In two experiments, we either interfered with verbal working memory, via articulatory suppression (Exp. 1), or entrained it, via presentation of verbal material (Exp. 2), and measured the resulting awareness of mind-wandering. Articulatory suppression decreased the likelihood to spontaneously notice mind-wandering, whereas verbal material increased retrospective awareness of mind-wandering. In addition, an ecological study using smartphones confirmed that inner speech vividness positively predicted mind-wandering awareness (Exp. 3). Together, these findings support the view that inner speech facilitates introspection of one’s thoughts, and therefore provides empirical evidence for a positive relation between language and consciousness.

In responding to distressing events, they may experience empathic distress fatigue, compassion fatigue, stress, burnout, and self-criticism, which in turn can alter their ability to provide compassion to both self and others, and can create persistent self-criticism and negative rumination. A creative framework designed to teach student therapists about Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) to underpin the worth of Compassionate Mind Training (CMT), is a training process designed to increase levels of compassion. Expected learning outcomes: On completion of teaching the 6-step study framework, student therapists will understand variables that influence compassion delivered to both self and others. They will understand how the compassionate mind model works, and consider how cultivating compassion can moderate self-critical dialogue. They will gain understanding of the 3 flows of compassion, examine how low levels of compassion can lead to empathic distress fatigue, compassion fatigue, burnout and self-criticism, and explore how emotions, such as shame and self-critical thinking impact upon well-being. Practical implications: The suggested programme will develop the ability in student therapists to ‘be kinder to self’ in times of stress, hence building their resilience.

Social Indicators Research 139(1","Abusive supervision in the workplace has been shown to have important direct consequence in work and work relationship, and also indirect consequences to workers’ well-being and relationships outside work. Consequences of abusive supervision have not been studied among migrant workers whose status in the host country of work is dependent on maintaining the work contract. This study investigates abusive supervision in 247 Filipino migrant workers in Macau, who hold temporary work contracts and work visas to engage in various low-skilled work (e.g., domestic helper, security guard, etc.). The study tests a model representing the indirect consequences of abusive supervision on the self-esteem and acculturation orientation of migrant workers, in particular, on the tendency to reject their heritage culture in their attempt to acculturate in the host country. Mediation analysis indicated that abusive supervisory perceptions led to lower self-esteem (b = −.19), which in turn relates to tendency to reject their heritage culture as part of acculturation (b = −.45) [indirect effect = .08, 90 % CI .04, .15]. The rejection of heritage culture is interpreted as a coping response to the negative indirect consequences of abusive supervision perceptions that may be partly attributed to being a migrant Filipino worker. The results are discussed in terms of how the acculturation of migrant workers reflects aspects of their well-being that may be adversely affected by vocational-related stress in the host country.

Journal of Education and Work 20(2","As many, perhaps most, high-school students engage in paid part-time employment, there is available in any Australian senior school classroom a range of work experiences that can be used to assist students to consider and reflect on working life and post-school pathways. Furthermore, these experiences are more readily available and authentic than those provided through school-organised work experience programmes. In order to understand the effectiveness of such experiences, students and teachers in six schools across two Australian states participated in processes of guided reflection on these experiences. Consistently, across cohorts of students in all of these schools, the authentic workplace experiences of paid part-time work were identified as assisting in securing a range of educational purposes associated with students' learning about work, the world of work and post-school options and pathways. Key variables in the likely success of this initiative were the facilitative capacity of teachers, their knowledge and valuing of working life outside schools and students' capacities and readiness to engage in reflection on their paid work.

Artifact-free EEG samples derived from 12 locations were subjected to spectral analysis. Additionally, half-hourly ratings of subjective tension and sleepiness levels and salivary melatonin measurements were collected.SETTINGCentre for Chronobiology, Psychiatric Hospitals of the University of Basel, Switzerland.PARTICIPANTSEight young healthy women and 8 young untreated women with MDD.INTERVENTIONSN/A.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTSMDD women exhibited higher frontal low-frequency (FLA) EEG activity (0.5-5.0 Hz) during extended wakefulness than controls, particularly during the night. Enhanced FLA was paralleled by higher levels of subjective sleepiness and tension. In MDD women, overall FLA levels correlated positively with depression scores. The timing of melatonin onset did not significantly differ between the two groups, but the nocturnal secretion of salivary melatonin was significantly attenuated in MDD women.CONCLUSIONSOur data imply that young women with MDD live on a higher homeostatic sleep pressure level, as indexed by enhanced FLA during wakefulness. Its positive correlation with depression scores indicates a possible functional relationship. High FLA could reflect a use-dependent phenomenon in depression (enhanced cognitive rumination or tension) and/or an attenuated circadian arousal signal.",0,1325

Health Education Research 18(3","This paper examines associations between overall school functioning and frequency of violent behaviors among young adolescents (ages 10- 14). The sample included 16 middle schools participating in an unrelated intervention study (on nutrition) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Data on violent behaviors and other variables were collected in student surveys in fall 1998 and spring 1999. We used multilevel modeling to assess the effect of school functioning on violent behavior after adjusting for known individual-level covariates of violent behaviors. We found an interaction between school functioning (group-level variable) and expectations for future education (individual-level variable). Among students who reported expectations of completing a college degree (71% of the sample), positive school functioning was negatively associated with violent behaviors. Among students that reported expectations of completing less than a college degree, no association was found between school functioning and violent behaviors. These results support earlier work suggesting that objectively measured school characteristics are associated with students' violent behaviors even after accounting for individual-level factors and also identify a subgroup of students for whom school detachment may be an issue.

Advances in mind-body medicine 24(1","BACKGROUNDObstacles to effectively rehabilitate inner-city adolescents in staff-secure residential treatment centers should not be underestimated. Effective evidence-based protocols are lacking to help juveniles who are often angry, detached, frustrated, and in direct conflict with their peers. Facing a myriad of issues ranging from youth delinquency offenses to trauma, abuse, drug/alcohol use, peer pressure/gang-related activities, lack of structure in home environments, mental health diagnoses, and cognitive functioning difficulties, these adolescents present extraordinary challenges to an over-stressed juvenile justice system.MATERIAL/METHODSA randomized controlled crossover study is utilized to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of a novel creative musical expression protocol as a catalyst for nonverbal and verbal disclosure leading to improvements in quality of life for inner-city youth in a court-referred residential treatment program. A total of 52 (30 females and 22 males) African-American, Asian, Caucasian, and Puerto Rican subjects ranging in age from 12 to 18 (mean age 14.5) completed the study.RESULTSDependent variable measures included the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS), the Adolescent Psychopathology Scale (APS), the Adolescent Anger Rating Scale (AARS), the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale, 2nd edition (RADS 2), and the Adolescent Visual-Analog Recreational Music Making Assessment (A-VARMMA). Statistically significant (experimental vs control) improvements in multiple parameters include school/work role performance, total depression, anhedonia/negative affect, negative self-evaluation, and instrumental anger. In addition, extended impact (experimental vs control) is characterized by statistically significant improvements 6 weeks after completion of the protocol, for school/work role performance, behavior toward others, anhedonia/negative affect, total anger, instrumental anger, anger, and interpersonal problems.LIMITATIONSThe primary limitations of this study include an extended follow-up period of only 6 weeks post completion of the protocol, and the inability to blind the counselors performing standardized assessments.CONCLUSIONSThis study is the first of its kind to test a replicable creative musical expression protocol as a catalyst for nonverbal and verbal disclosure leading to improved quality of life for inner-city youth in a court-referred residential treatment program. With substantial potential for widespread dissemination, this innovative protocol for adolescents can be readily utilized by behavioral health professionals without prior musical experience.",0,1327

Mindfulness.","Post-event processing (PEP) refers to a prolonged and negative rumination following anxiety-provoking social events. Because PEP may maintain social anxiety over time, it is important to reduce this repetitive, negative thinking. Past research has shown that PEP can be reduced through self-compassion. As such, the primary purpose of the present study was to examine the circumstances under which self-compassion buffers against PEP. Given that PEP may be exacerbated by negative performance feedback, we examined whether self-compassion would buffer against PEP under these circumstances (i.e., receiving negative performance feedback). Participants (N = 66) provided an impromptu speech and were randomly assigned to receive either positive or negative speech feedback. As expected, negative performance feedback led to significantly more PEP than positive feedback. However, whereas this effect was particularly pronounced amongst those low on self-compassion, there were no significant differences between conditions on PEP amongst those high on self-compassion. The findings from the present study suggest that trait self-compassion serves to limit PEP in situations where negative performance feedback is provided. This work builds on the benefits of self-compassion in the context of social stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1328

Health & Social Care in the Community 25(2","The transition of adolescents with chronic conditions is a challenging task. This study aimed to explore the experiences and needs of adolescents with chronic conditions in the transition period and to apply these findings to the design of a generic patient education programme. Data were collected from a sample of 29 adolescents with chronic conditions from Northern Germany and Switzerland including a broad range of views due to variation in disease management and organisation of care both in paediatric and adult populations. Participants were interviewed in group (n = 18) or individual (n = 11) interviews between September 2011 and February 2012, and the data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The findings revealed that the interviewees expressed high levels of competency in the management of their chronic conditions but identified gaps in healthcare and unmet needs during transition. In particular, they believed that they would benefit from opportunities to exchange ideas and more specific information with peers about vocational and medical issues concerning adolescent health. Identified themes reflecting adolescent needs were used to develop the transition workshop including modules regarding the following: transfer to adult medicine, their new role as a patient, orientation within the healthcare system, vocational issues, detachment from parents, social support, contraception, substance abuse, family planning, stress-management, activation of resources and developing personal goals. The workshop’s content was largely generic and included some condition-specific components. The workshop was designed as a compact 2-day patient education programme in a group setting for adolescents prior to their transfer to adult care. The guiding principle was the idea of empowerment by supporting the adolescents through various interactive methods to develop adequate knowledge, skills, understanding and motivation regarding their chronic conditions. We conclude that patient education programmes promoting adolescent self-management and empowerment increase the preparedness for transition.

The incidence of retinal tears was 14.5% (n=53) and that of vitreous and/or retinal hemorrhage was 22.7% (n=83). For analysis of possible predictors for complications to PVD, patients diagnosed with retinal tears or vitreous hemorrhage between May and July 2009 were also included in the study, resulting in a total of 426 patients. Predictors of a retinal tear were symptoms of visual impairment (P=0.024), the presence of vitreous or retinal hemorrhage at examination (P<0.001), and a duration of symptoms for <24 hours (P=0.004). Symptoms of flashes did not constitute an extra risk of retinal tears (P=0.135). Subsequent retinal pathology (follow-up time 4.5 years), including vitreous detachment/hemorrhage or retinal tears/detachment, occurred more often in patients presenting with a retinal tear. For patients with a retinal tear, the relative risk of having a retinal detachment in the same eye during the follow-up time was 17.7 when compared to patients without a retinal tear (risk ratio 17.7, 95% confidence interval 2.2-145).CONCLUSIONPatients seeking care on the first day have a higher risk of retinal tears. Also, symptoms of visual loss or a history of previous PVD-related pathology and vitreous/retinal hemorrhage at examination indicate a substantially higher risk of retinal complications. These findings may lead to better management and order of priority among these patients.",0,1331

Health Education Research 21(4","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention delivered in gay venues in US cities has been found to be effective in reducing HIV transmission in the 1990s but effects might not be generalizable to different times and settings. Doubts have been raised about: outreach's ability to address skills and explore personal behaviour; big-city commercial gay venues being appropriate sites for outreach because of gossip and social surveillance; and acceptability of outreach by professionals rather than 'popular opinion formers'. We evaluated coverage, feasibility, acceptability and perceived impact of venue-based HIV prevention outreach by professionals in London, employing observation, surveys and interviews with venue-users, and focus groups/semi-structured interviews with workers. We found high coverage especially among target groups. Addressing negotiation skills and personal behaviour was feasible but required worker motivation and skill. Social surveillance rarely impeded work. Gay men generally found outreach acceptable and useful, and professionals were not regarded negatively. Impact on knowledge was commonly reported; impacts on negotiation skills and reflection on personal behaviour were more common among men experiencing longer contacts. In conclusion, professional HIV prevention outreach in gay venues in large cities is a feasible and acceptable intervention with significant potential impacts.

Eye and vision (London, England","BACKGROUNDDuring eye rotations the vitreous humour moves with respect to the eye globe. This relative motion has been suggested to possibly have an important role in inducing degradation of the gel structure, which might lead to vitreous liquefaction and/or posterior vitreous detachment. Aim of the present work is to study the characteristics of vitreous motion induced by eye rotations.METHODSWe use an experimental setup, consisting of a Perspex model of the vitreous chamber that, for simplicity, is taken to have a spherical shape. The model is filled with an artificial vitreous humour, prepared as a solution of agar powder and hyaluronic acid sodium salt in deionised water, which has viscoelastic mechanical properties similar to those of the real vitreous. The model rotates about an axis passing through the centre of the sphere and velocity measurements are taken on the equatorial plane orthogonal to the axis of rotation, using an optical technique.RESULTSThe results show that fluid viscoelasticity has a strong influence on flow characteristics. In particular, at certain frequencies of oscillation of the eye model, fluid motion can be resonantly excited. This means that fluid velocity within the domain can be significantly larger than that of the wall.CONCLUSIONSThe frequencies for which resonant excitation occurs are within the range of possible eye rotations frequencies. Therefore, the present results suggest that resonant excitation of vitreous motion is likely to occur in practice. This, in turn, implies that eye rotations produce large stresses on the retina and within the vitreous that may contribute to the disruption of the vitreous gel structure. The present results also have implications for the choice of the ideal properties for vitreous substitute fluids.",0,1333

The measurement of acoustic properties of melanomas in vivo has not yet been reported after proton-beam irradiation. This prospective study was conducted on a cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with primary malignant melanoma to assess in vivo the ability of quantitative echography to detect changes in choroidal malignant melanomas after proton-beam irradiation and to follow the ultrasonographic changes during 24 months posttreatment. Echographic evaluations of these patients were performed at diagnosis and repeated every 6 months after treatment over a 2-y period. The acoustic parameters included in this work are derived from the calibrated tissue backscatter spectra (spectral slope, spectral intercept and apparent integrated backscatter) of a selected tumor volume after correction of the apparatus transfer function and beam diffraction. Clinical parameters resulting from conventional echography were also quantified and included mainly tumor height, tumor vascularity and internal reflectivity. Spectral intercept and apparent integrated backscatter were found to be the most useful to evaluate changes in melanomas after treatment. Significant (p < 0.05) differences of these parameter values were observed between pre- and postproton therapy. In particular, significant changes (compared with baseline) were observed for these parameters, even when the tumor size after treatment was not significantly different from baseline.

To ease this transition, preceptorship programmes have been implemented to foster professional socialization and help students achieve confidence in their practice during their final clinical placement (consolidation experience). Preparation for the preceptor role is dependent upon the information offered by the agency as well as by the educational institution. Nursing staff are requested for much of the calendar year to work with increasing numbers of undergraduate students at various levels, function as preceptors in the final clinical experience (consolidation) as well as be involved in the orientation of newly hired nurses.METHODSThis qualitative study used one-on-one tape recorded interviews with nurses who had previous experience as a preceptor. Thematic analysis of the transcribed data resulted in the emergence of an overall theme and categories.RESULTSEight nurses were interviewed from a variety of units including medical surgical as well as critical care. The overriding theme from the analysis was 'safe passage'. This safe passage was for the patient and the student and was accomplished through the process of teaching and a clear view of the preceptor role. Challenges to the role were lack of recognition by other nursing staff as well as limited support from some faculty advisors.

Socio-behavioral data were obtained by face-to-face questionnaires. Blood samples were collected and tested for HIV. Two sputa were obtained in tuberculosis (TB) symptomatic participants for acid-fast-bacilli (AFB) smear testing. After a descriptive analysis, crude prevalence were calculated, then weighted to take account of the sampling method. Factors associated with HIV and TB were studied using adjusted log-binomial regression. Population size was estimated by capture-recapture.RESULTS450 PWUD were recruited in May 2014.

Within this paid internship midwifery students' have the opportunity to develop professional behaviours, consolidate knowledge and learn necessary skills to fulfil the role of midwife under the supervision of registered midwives.OBJECTIVETo explore midwifery students' experiences of the internship period.DESIGN AND METHODA descriptive qualitative study using focus groups with ethical approval.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTSBSc Midwifery students' in the final year of their programme (n = 17) in an Irish University were invited to participate in a focus group interview midway through their internship. All participants (n = 13) had experience of working in two sites used for internship at the time of data collection.RESULTSKey findings include the importance of the internship period in consolidating clinical skills and building confidence and competence for midwifery practice. Midwifery students' experience considerable stress during the internship period. Demands identified as stressors include providing care in increasingly complex clinical areas, meeting academic deadlines and maintaining a work life balance. Negative interpersonal experiences and dismissive attitudes to reflection on practice were barriers to learning. Midwifery students' articulated the importance of learning through doing, a supportive learning culture and philosophy in the unit, protected time for reflection and being included and valued as part of the midwifery team.CONCLUSIONSThe benefits and challenges associated with internship in midwifery are apparent, particularly when students' are contending with two geographically distant sites. Support mechanisms and suggestions for improvements are considered.",0,1344

They propose a model consisting of levels of evidence, the aim of which is to 'bridge the gap between evidence based and evidence informed practice' (p. 218). In order to address the dearth of examples in the international literature of how organisations have dealt with these complexities in practice, this article provides a case study of how a large Irish youth organisation, Foróige, has endeavoured to adopt an inclusive approach to evidence, working towards both evidence based and evidence informed practice. Drawing on Veerman and Van Yperen's (2007) framework, the case study shows that Foróige committed itself to gathering different types of evidence, including logic models and theoretical understandings at the foundation level and experimental design studies of key programmes at the advanced level. The case study focuses in detail on the intermediate level, whereby practitioners were trained to evaluate aspects of their own work, with a view to embedding evaluation and reflection in day to day practice. The process is described and key lessons emerging are discussed.",0,1345

The Depth of Field: Exploring Ageing resource (DOF) uses photographs, reflective questioning prompts, older adults' narratives and collaborative dialogue to foster anticipatory reflection or 'preflection' in medical students prior to their first geriatric medicine clinical placement. The aim of this research is to explore whether photographs, narratives and small group collaborative dialogue fosters reflective learning, enhances reflective capacity and has the potential to shift medical students' attitudes towards caring for older adults.METHODSThis study used a mixed method evaluation design, measuring attitudes using pre and post questionnaire responses and individual written reflections drawn from 128 second year medical students, exploring their perceptions toward older adults.RESULTSQuantitative and qualitative data indicated that the DOF session generated reflective learning that resulted in positive shifts in medical students' perceptions towards older adults. The qualitative reflections were captured in four main themes: the opportunity provided to Envision working with older adults; the Tension created to challenge learners' misinformed assumptions, and the work of Dismantling those assumptions, leading to Seeing older people as individuals.CONCLUSIONSThese findings highlight how visual and narrative methodologies can be used as an effective reflective learning tool to challenge medical students' assumptions around ageing and how these may influence their care of older adults.",0,1346

Mindfulness 9(1","Previous research on trait mindfulness facets using person-centered analyses (e.g., latent profile analysis [LPA]) has identified four distinct mindfulness profiles among college students: a high mindfulness group (high on all facets of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ]), a judgmentally observing group (highest on observing, but low on non-judging of inner experience and acting with awareness), a non-judgmentally aware group (high on non-judging of inner experience and acting with awareness, but very low on observing), and a low mindfulness group (low on all facets of the FFMQ). In the present study, we used LPA to identify distinct mindfulness profiles in a community-based sample of US military personnel (majority veterans; n = 407) and non-military college students (n = 310) and compare these profiles on symptoms of psychological health outcomes (e.g., suicidality, PTSD, anxiety, rumination) and percentage of participants exceeding clinically significant cutoffs for depressive symptoms, substance use, and alcohol use. In the subsample of college students, we replicated previous research and found four distinct mindfulness profiles; however, in the military subsample, we found three distinct mindfulness profiles (a combined low mindfulness/judgmentally observing class). In both subsamples, we found that the most adaptive profile was the 'high mindfulness' profile (i.e., demonstrated the lowest scores on all psychological symptoms and the lowest probability of exceeding clinical cutoffs). Based on these findings, we purport that the comprehensive examination of an individual’s mindfulness profile could help clinicians tailor interventions/treatments that capitalize on an individual’s specific strengths and work to address their specific deficits.

PharmacoEconomics 31(8","OBJECTIVEThis review aimed to identify published studies that provide an empirical measure of process utility, which can be incorporated into estimates of QALY calculations.METHODSA literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify published studies of process utility. Articles were included if they were written in the English language and reported empirical measures of process utility that could be incorporated into the QALY calculation; those studies reporting utilities that were not anchored on a scale of 0 representing dead and 1 representing full health were excluded from the review.RESULTSFifteen studies published between 1996 and 2012 were included. Studies included respondents from the USA, Australia, Scotland and the UK, Europe and Canada. Eight of the included studies explored process utility associated with treatments; six explored process utility associated with screening procedures or tests; and one was performed in preventative care. A variety of approaches were used to detect and measure process utility: four studies used standard gamble techniques; four studies used time trade-off (TTO); one study used conjoint analysis and one used a combination of conjoint analysis and TTO; one study used SF-36 data; one study used both TTO and EQ-5D; and three studies used wait trade-off techniques. Measures of process utility for different drug delivery methods ranged from 0.02 to 0.27. Utility estimates associated with different dosing strategies ranged from 0.005 to 0.09. Estimates for convenience (able to take on an empty stomach) ranged from 0.001 to 0.028. Estimates of process utility associated with screening and testing procedures ranged from 0.0005 to 0.031. Both of these estimates were obtained for management approaches to cervical cancer screening.CONCLUSIONThe identification of studies through conventional methods was difficult due to the lack of consistent indexing and terminology across studies; however, the evidence does support the existence of process utility in treatment, screening and preventative care settings. There was considerable variation between estimates. The range of methodological approaches used to identify and measure process utility, coupled with the need for further research into, for example, the application of estimates in economic models, means it is difficult to know whether these differences are a true reflection of the amount of process utility that enters into an individual's utility function, or whether they are associated with features of the studies' methodological design. Without further work, and a standardised approach to the methodology for the detection and measurement of process utility, comparisons between estimates are difficult. This literature review supports the existence of process utility and indicates that, despite the need for further research in the area, it could be an important component of an individual's utility function, which should at least be considered, if not incorporated, into cost-utility analyses.",0,1350

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal 19(41","Nanoparticles at fluid interfaces are becoming a central topic in colloid science studies. Unlike in the case of colloids in suspensions, the description of the forces determining the physical behavior of colloids at interfaces still represents an outstanding problem in the modern theory of colloidal interactions. These forces regulate the formation of complex two-dimensional structures, which can be exploited in a number of applications of technological interest; optical devices, catalysis, molecular electronics or emulsions stabilization. From a fundamental viewpoint and typical for colloidal systems, nanoparticles and microparticles at interfaces are ideal experimental and theoretical models for investigating questions of relevance in condensed matter physics, such as the phase behavior of two-dimensional fluids. This review is a topical survey of the stability, self-assembly behavior and mutual interactions of nanoparticles at fluid interfaces. Thermodynamic models offer an intuitive approach to explaining the interfacial stability of nanoparticles in terms of a few material properties, such as the surface and line tensions. A critical discussion of the theoretical basis, accuracy, limitations, and recent predictions of the thermodynamic models is provided. We also review recent work concerned with nanoparticle self-assembly at fluid interfaces. Complex two-dimensional structures varying considerably with the particle nature have been observed in a number of experiments. We discuss the self-assembly behavior in terms of nanoparticle composition, focusing on sterically stabilized, charged and magnetic nanoparticles. The structure of the two-dimensional assemblies is a reflection of complex intercolloidal forces. Unlike the case for bulk colloidal suspensions, which often can be described reasonably well using DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory, the description of particles at interfaces requires the consideration of interfacial deformations as well as interfacial thermal fluctuations. We analyze the importance of both deformation and fluctuations, as well as the modification of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Finally, we discuss possible future directions in the field of nanoparticles at interfaces.",0,1351

Anthropology & medicine: 1-15.","Throughout the history of bareback sex (condomless sex between men), 'subjects' have been created, particularly through scientific literature, to characterise the men who engage in the sexual practice. For example, a gay man who does not use a condom may be framed as a pathologised subject. This paper first presents this history. Afterwards, by relying upon ethnographic data such as interviews collected from fieldwork research done in Toronto in 2014 with young gay men who have bareback sex, it shows exactly how these young gay men related themselves to those subjects. Then, it focuses on the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) Truvada as a new HIV prevention technology. Although PrEP can allow condomless sex to occur while diminishing the risk of HIV transmission, at the time of the research, none of the young gay men were interested in using this tool despite being the subjects for whom the drug is tailored. This paper argues that PrEP and subjectivity are coproduced and can have conflicting meanings. This contradiction of meanings is a result of the various representations and symbols of bareback sex and the men who engage in the practice that have been produced throughout the history of bareback sex.",0,1352

However, lecturer-led simulated practice learning has been perceived as detached from contemporary nursing practice by some nursing students. Therefore, a pilot project was implemented in the authors' university to explore the use of student-led simulated practice learning and its potential benefits for nursing students.AIMTo evaluate the effectiveness of student-led simulated practice learning in pre-registration nursing programmes. The authors specifically wanted to: enhance the students' skills; improve their critical thinking and reflective strategies; and develop their leadership and management techniques.METHODA literature review was undertaken to examine the evidence supporting student-led simulated practice learning. A skills gap analysis was then conducted with 35 third-year nursing students to identify their learning needs, from which suitable simulated practice learning scenarios and sessions were developed and undertaken. These sessions were evaluated using debriefs following each of the sessions, as well as informal discussions with the nursing students.FINDINGSThe pilot project identified that student-led simulated learning: developed nursing students' ability to plan and facilitate colleagues' practice learning; enabled nursing students to develop their mentoring skills; reinforced the nursing students' self-awareness, which contributed to their personal development; and demonstrated the importance of peer feedback and support through the debriefs. Challenges included overcoming some students' resistance to the project and that some lecturers were initially concerned that nursing students may not have the clinical expertise to lead the simulated practice learning sessions effectively.CONCLUSIONThis pilot project has demonstrated how student-led simulated practice learning sessions could be used to engage nursing students as partners in their learning, enhance their knowledge and skills, and promote self-directed learning.",0,1353

(2009"," ""The educational effects of portfolios on undergraduate student learning: a Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME","INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the use of portfolios as learning and assessment tools has become more widespread across the range of health professions. Whilst a growing body of literature has accompanied these trends, there is no clear collated summary of the evidence for the educational effects of the use of portfolios in undergraduate education. This systematic review is the result of our work to provide such a summary.METHODSWe developed a protocol based on the recommendations of the Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME) collaboration. Citations retrieved by electronic searches of 10 databases were assessed against pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria by two independent reviewers and full texts of potentially relevant articles were obtained. Studies were identified for inclusion in the review by examination of full text articles by two independent reviewers. At all stages, discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data relating to characteristics of the student population, intervention, outcome measures, student design and outcomes were collected using a piloted data extraction form. Each study was assessed against 11 quality indicators designed to provide information about how well it was designed and conducted; and against the Kirkpatrick hierarchy as modified for educational settings. Comparisons between different groups were carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric ANOVA) or the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate.RESULTSElectronic searches yielded 2,348 citations. A further 23 citations were obtained by hand searching of reference lists. About 554 full articles were retrieved and assessed against our inclusion criteria. Of the 69 studies included in our review, 18 were from medicine, 32 from nursing and 19 from other allied health professions, including dentistry, physiotherapy and radiography. In all professional groups, portfolios were used mainly in the clinical setting, completion was compulsory, reflection required and assessment (either formative, summative or a combination of both) the norm. Three studies used electronic portfolios. Whilst many studies used a combination of data collection methods, over half of all included studies used questionnaires, a third used focus group interviews and another third used direct assessment of portfolios. Most studies assessed student or tutor perceptions of the effect of the use of portfolios on their learning. Five studies used a comparative design, one of which was a randomized controlled trial. Studies were most likely to meet the quality indicators relating to appropriateness of study subjects, clarity of research question and completeness of data. However, in many studies, methods were not reported in sufficient detail to allow a judgement to be made. About 19 of the 69 included studies (27%) met seven or more quality indicators. Across all professions, such 'higher quality' studies were more likely to have been published recently. The median 'quality score' (number of indicators met) rose from two for studies published in 2000 or earlier to seven for studies published in 2005 or later. Significant differences were observed between the quality scores for studies published in or before 2000 and those published between 2001 and 2004 (p = 0.027), those published in or before 2000 and those published in 2005 or later (p = 0.002) and between all studies (p = 0.004). Similar trends were seen in all professional groups. About 59 (85%) of the included studies were assessed at level 1 of the modified Kirkpatrick hierarchy (i.e. 'participation' effects, including 'post hoc' evaluations of student perceptions of the effects of keeping a portfolio on their learning). About 9 (13%) of the studies reported direct measurement of changes in student skills or attitudes and one study reported a change in student behaviour. The main effects of portfolio use identified by the included studies were: Improvement in student knowledge and understanding (28 studies, six at Kirkpatrick level 2 or above), greater self-awareness and encouragement to reflection (44 tudies, seven at Kirkpatrick level 2 or above) and the ability to learn independently (10 studies, one at Kirkpatrick level 2). The findings of higher quality studies also identified benefits in these areas. They reported improved student knowledge and understanding, particularly the ability to integrate theory with practice, although a correlation with improved scores in other assessments was not always apparent. Greater self-awareness and engagement in reflection were also noted, although some studies questioned the quality of the reflection undertaken. Higher quality studies also suggest that use of portfolios improves feedback to students and gives tutors a greater awareness of students' needs, may help students to cope with uncertain or emotionally demanding situations and prepares students for postgraduate settings in which reflective practice is required. Time commitment required to collate a portfolio was the major drawback identified. In two of the studies, this was found to detract from other clinical learning.CONCLUSIONSAt present, the strength and extent of the evidence base for the educational effects of portfolios in the undergraduate setting is limited. However, there is evidence of an improving trend in the quality of reported studies. 'Higher quality' papers identify improvements in knowledge and understanding, increased self-awareness and engagement in reflection and improved student-tutor relationships as the main benefits of portfolio use. However, they also suggest that whilst portfolios encourage students to engage in reflection, the quality of those reflections cannot be assumed and that the time commitment required for portfolio completion may detract from other learning or deter students from engaging with the process unless required to do so by the demands of assessment. Further work is needed to strengthen the evidence base for portfolio use, particularly comparative studies which observe changes in student knowledge and abilities directly, rather than reporting on their perceptions once a portfolio has been completed.",0,1355

Currently, psychotherapy training organizations are banding together and centralizing their procedures to arrive at nationally agreed forms and levels of qualification. The widespread development across Europe has partly been driven by an earlier rumor of the demand for harmonization across the various European Union (EU) states. Obviously, the ethical and textual issues posed by writing and representation are not specific to psychotherapy, and indeed feminist researchers have made significant contributions to these debates. Nevertheless, it should be noted that these measures mark a huge sea change that also has considerable consequences for each particular model of psychotherapy. Hence the conclusion is, far from opening up a realm for the rumination and exploration, case notes are currently a site of considerable anxiety for psychotherapists in the UK.

AIDS Care 28 Suppl 2: 14-20.","Young women who sell sex (YWSS) in Southern Africa are highly vulnerable to HIV, as the risks of being young and female in a high prevalence setting coalesce with those of commercial sex. YWSS are less able to negotiate safe sex, more likely to have higher risk partners, and less likely to use available health services compared to older sex workers. In Zimbabwe's national HIV programme for sex workers, fewer than 1% of clients were 15-29. We developed monthly interactive workshops for YWSS based on an Activity Pack consisting of 21 sessions organised into six modules. The aim was to encourage YWSS' interaction with each other, build their trust, confidence and skills, and encourage uptake of clinical services. We conducted a process evaluation to assess programme strengths, identify challenges, and recommend changes. This paper presents findings synthesising programme records with qualitative data and discusses feasibility, acceptability, and outputs during the pilot phase. In total, 143 YWSS attended meetings and most were from the target 15-19-year-old age group. Participants enjoyed the sessions and reported improved cooperation, willingness to negotiate with clients, and self-reflection about their futures. Staff found facilitating sessions easy and activities clear and appropriate. Challenges included identifying appropriate referrals, initial recruitment of women in some sites, and managing participants' requests for financial compensation. The number of clients aged 15-19 increased at sex worker clinics in all sites. This programme is the first to target YWSS in Zimbabwe to address their disproportionately low service use. It proved feasible to staff and acceptable to participants over a one-year period.

One contributing factor may be students' inability to engage in meaningful reflection and self-correcting behaviours. This paper reports the evaluation of a tool, process and resources developed to assist students to reflect on feedback and engage in self-assessment. Students were assisted to develop self-assessment skills by reflecting on, and engaging with feedback from previous workplace experiences to develop goals, learning outcomes and strategies to improve performance with mostly positive results. A secondary aim was to identify common learning strategies or barriers that impacted on student outcomes. Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: 1) preparing for clinical learning, 2) relationships and engagement levels, 3) shared awareness and, 4) developing clinical practice.

Common barriers to clinical practice improvement related to a lack of opportunity in some settings, and lack of staff willingness to support students to achieve identified goals.

She had been abusive and physically aggressive frequently without specific reasons and was involved in criminal legal cases. She was hospitalized twice. During her first hospital stay she experienced a brief episode of detachment from her environment, similar to episodes reportedly suffered at home. Psychosis had developed following heavy polysubstance abuse. Her mother provided sachets containing benzylglycinamide, a substance with no known psychotropic effects, which were also present in the patient's urine. She was occasionally positive for cannabinoids. She used to buy various novel psychoactive substances (NPSs) from the internet and used experimentally various substances freely made available to her by drug suppliers/dealers. She was unable to explain clearly why she was taking any of the identified NPS. She stated she was taking benzylglycinamide to calm her when smoking synthetic cannabinoids. While it appears that benzylglycinamide is not likely to constitute a novel drug of abuse, her polysubstance use exemplifies trends in NPS use patterns among the youths in the Western world and should alert mental health workers as to the possible dangers of such behavior and its reflection on social behavior and psychopathology.

Eye (London, England","AIMSA study to assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical effectiveness of electronic referral--with and without images--of patients directly from optometrists in primary care to the hospital eye service (HES) in contrast to the traditional paper-based referral, through the general practitioner (GP).METHODSThree optometry practices sent consecutive referrals with images through the NHS Net to the HES. The standard General Ophthalmic Service form was electronically redesigned with additional information on patient choice for advice, appointment, or surgery. All paper referrals to the HES from the same three optometry practices before the study period were analysed (control group A) as were all paper referrals from the remaining optometrists in Fife (control group B).RESULTSA total of 346 electronic referrals were received over 18 months. 218 (63%) were classified as requiring and 128 (37%) as not requiring a HES appointment. The latter were subsequently examined with unexpected pathology found in three cases (glaucoma, macular pigment epithelial detachment, and possible peripheral retinal tear). In both groups, the major pathologies reported were macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and abnormal retinal appearances. A total of 17 (15%) patients in group A and 26 (8.4%) patients in group B were classified as not requiring HES appointment. These control groups indicate that approximately 10-15% of paper referrals are not seen in the HES. To summarise, therefore, 63% of people referred by the optometrist directly using electronic referral (with or without images) were given a HES appointment compared to 85% of people referred through the traditional paper method (without images) through their GP.CONCLUSIONElectronic referral with images to the HES is safe, speedy, efficient, and clinically accurate given some limitations and avoids unnecessary consultation in 37% of referrals.",0,1365

Disabil Health J 11(3","BACKGROUND: The provision of dental care for children with intellectual disability raises many ethical questions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore approaches to dental treatment in an anxious child with intellectual disability and the ethical dilemmas that ensue. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between February and May 2012. A clinical scenario was used to establish a starting point for a discussion of the clinical approach and lead to an ethical reflection. Four topics were discussed: first contact with the patient, information, attitude towards the patient and outcome from the practitioner's viewpoint. The coding procedure used thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Most practitioners fetched the patient from the waiting room personally, greeted them, gave them special attention, and either began the consultation at once, or used distraction to relax the patient. Verbal language and tell-show-do were most often used to provide information. Anxiety and pain were evaluated using parental assessment and standardized scales. A reassuring attitude was adopted. An ethical dilemma arose if the patient refused care or had to be restrained. Practitioners reported sacrificing ethical values (patient autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence) when making a clinical decision. CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of practices but no consensus. This study shed some light on the different perspectives of dentists, most of whom adopted a utilitarianist viewpoint. In this context, ethical reflection is necessary to avoid a detached attitude or, worse, abuse. Further study would enrich this reflection.",0,1366

(2011"," ""The clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic retinal interventions to reduce the risk of retinal detachment and subsequent vision loss in adults and children with Stickler syndrome: a systematic review."" Health technology assessment (Winchester, England","BACKGROUNDStickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population.OBJECTIVESThe aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis.DATA SOURCESA systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted.REVIEW METHODSTwo reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed.RESULTSThe literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360° cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis.CONCLUSIONSOnly 360° cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain.FUTURE WORKA service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are equired to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis.FUNDINGThis study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.",0,1369

The aim of this review is to summarise the literature published around facilitating reflection in a medical course, and to answer the question : What is the current evidence regarding learning and development moments across the medical curriculum in developing students' reflective practice? Methods: A review of the literature was undertaken using defined databases and the search terms 'medical students', 'medical education', 'reflection', 'reflect' and 'medicine'. The search was limited to peer-reviewed published material in English and between the years 2001 and 2011, and included research, reviews and opinion pieces. Results: Thirty-six relevant articles were found, identifying enhancing factors and barriers to effectively teaching reflective practice within medical curricula, relating to: The breadth of the meaning of reflection; facilitating reflection by medical educators; using written or web-based portfolios to facilitate reflection; and assessing the reflective work of students. Discussion: A variety of reflective purposes was found in this literature review. Evidence indicates that, if students are unclear as to the purpose of reflection and do not see educators modelling reflective behaviours, they are likely to undervalue this important skill regardless of the associated learning and development opportunities embedded in the curriculum.

The present study explored the relative benefits of dispositional mindfulness compared to other commonly researched ER strategies, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression, in a sample of youth with major depression presenting to a clinical service. Results demonstrated that mindfulness is distinct from these other ER strategies and is associated with lower cross-sectional levels of depression, anxiety, rumination and dysfunctional attitudes, and improved quality of life. Greater dispositional mindfulness also predicted greater recovery from these symptoms. It was concluded that a greater tendency to use mindfulness as an ER strategy is associated with positive mental health outcomes and better quality of life.

If interprofessional education and subsequent collaboration are truly to be patient-centred, it is important to identify a value base which creates a healthcare professional identity that facilitates collaboration. Caring, as a humanistic value, is found in both nursing and social work professionals.METHODA mixed method approach, primarily qualitative but with a quantitative component, was chosen for evaluation of the interprofessional seminars. The data were collected between 2007-2008 by videotape recordings of the sessions, follow-up telephone interviews and a questionnaire.FINDINGSThere was cultivation in the nursing students of a deeper understanding of caring based on openness and a non-judgmental approach, learned from their social work counterparts. Reciprocally, social work students learned about the nursing students' daily activities as they observed the natural process of trust and communication in the context of caring.CONCLUSIONEnhanced understanding of caring in practice is not possible via learning through a uni-professional approach.

The British journal of ophthalmology 101(3","AIMPerfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) can migrate into subretinal space in detached and stiffened retina with open holes during vitreoretinal surgery. An innovative 'soft shell' technique was introduced to reduce the complication using hyaluronate (HA) to 'cover' the retinal hole. This study aims to study the effectiveness of this technique in vitro.METHODSEx vivo porcine retina was mounted on a transwell insert. Beneath the retina was an aqueous solution. Two retinal holes were made using needle punctures. One of the two retinal holes was covered with HA. Perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) was added above the retina incrementally using a syringe pump. The height of PFO required to cause the migration of PFO through the retinal holes was measured. The 'pendant drop' method was carried out to measure the interfacial tensions between the PFO and aqueous, and between PFO and four different concentrations of HA solution.RESULTSA statistically higher PFO level was required to cause the migration of PFO through the retinal hole with HA coating than without HA coating (Tobit regression with p<0.05). The use of HA was associated with 2.39-fold increase in hydrostatic pressure before the collapse of the PFO interface at the retinal holes. The interfacial tension between PFO and HA solution with concentrations of 0.05%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% were 54.2±0.6, 55.3±0.6, 59.5±1.5 and 68.3±1.3 mN/m, respectively (mean±SD). The interfacial tension between PFO and aqueous with 1% HA coating (68.3±1.3 mN/m) was significantly higher than that without (37.4±3.4 mN/m) (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONSThe interfacial tension between HA and PFO is higher than that between aqueous and PFO. This is a plausible physical explanation of how the 'soft shell' technique might work to prevent subretinal migration of PFCL.",0,1373

Thirty-four clinical studies comprising 1,935 patients met the following selection criteria: a study published in a peer reviewed journal, a valid materials and methods section (describing age, gender, number of subjects, follow-up period, treatment modality, and impingement stage), and acromioplasty without rotator cuff repair. Six hundred and ninety-eight patients had an open decompression (OD) and 1,237 had an arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) for Stage II and III impingement. When possible, only Stage II patients were reviewed. A few studies combined Stage II and III patients in their results; thus, the patients were placed into two groups (OD and ASD) composed of four categories: OD of Stage II impingement (494 patients), OD of Stage II and III impingement (204 patients), ASD of Stage II impingement (727 patients), and ASD of Stage II and III impingement (510 patients). The average duration of symptoms before surgery ranged from 6 months to 43 months in the OD group and 6 months to 61 months in the ASD group. The average age was 41.8 and 42.1 years, clinical follow-up 6 months to 62 months and 12 months to 41 months in the OD and ASD groups, respectively. The objective success rates were 83.3% versus 81.4% and the subjective success rates were 90.0% versus 89.3% for OD versus ASD, respectively. Return to work ranged from 43% to 100% in the OD group and 74% to 100% in the ASD group. Based on our review, the outcome from ASD is similar to OD. For persistent stage II primary impingement, we recommend starting with ASD and reserve OD for surgical failures. ASD allows earlier rehabilitation than OD because complete detachment of the deltoid is not performed, yet ASD is technically more demanding and has a long learning curve.",0,1375

Drug design, development and therapy 11: 163-173.","Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the main cause of failure following retinal detachment surgery. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the development of PVR, and EMT inhibition decreases collagen gel contraction and fibrotic membrane formation, resulting in prevention of PVR. Resveratrol is naturally found in red wine and has inhibitory effects on EMT. Resveratrol is widely used in cardioprotection, neuroprotection, chemotherapy, and antiaging therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on TGF-β2-induced EMT in ARPE-19 cells in vitro. We found that resveratrol suppressed the decrease of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and caused an increase of alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in TGF-β2-treated ARPE-19 cells, assessed using Western blots; moreover, it also suppressed the decrease in ZO-1 and the increase of vimentin expression, observed using immunocytochemistry. Resveratrol attenuated TGF-β2-induced wound closure and cell migration in ARPE-19 cells in a scratch wound test and modified Boyden chamber assay, respectively. We also found that resveratrol reduced collagen gel contraction - assessed by collagen matrix contraction assay - and suppressed the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-β2-treated ARPE-19 cells. These results suggest that resveratrol mediates anti-EMT effects, which could be used in the prevention of PVR.",0,1376

He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2004 with Avram Hershko and Irwin Rose for their discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. When Ciechanover began his work on proteolysis, the field was outside the realm of scientific mainstream as many thought that the fundamental secrets relating to sequence specificity were relevant to the synthetic side, or code side. The notion that specific sequences could selectively guide a destructive process did not naturally occur to scientists including Ciechanover himself. The emergence of controversial evidence demonstrating a requirement for metabollic energy in intracellular protein degradation, refuted the idea that cellular proteolysis was an entirely exergonic process occuring in the lysosme and prompted Ciechanover, Hershko, and Rose to ""launch an attack"" on the system, in order to uncover true pathway. Later findings of Ciechanover and subsequent groups showed that not only was the process energy-dependent, but that 8% of the human genome is remarkabley one large ubiquitin system.

Personnel Psychology 60(2","Reviews the book Questions of character: Illuminating the heart of leadership through literature by Joseph L. Badaracco, Jr. (2006). The fundamental framework structuring this book is a set of eight questions that define what the author thinks are the significant personal issues facing leaders. Each question has its own chapter, beginning with a synopsis of the story used to define the issues and followed by the questions of character derived from it. The first issue, exemplified by Willie Loman, is whether dreams are animating and healthy or delusional and enervating. The second issue is flexibility in one's moral code. This issue is presented in the context of the African novel, Things fall apart, where a tribal leader commits a crime for which he is eventually punished. The third issue has to do with the nature of a leader's role models: Are they inspiring or depressing? Fourth, there is a gut check for determining whether leaders have the deep commitment to make their dreams real. In short, does the leader actually care? Responsibility becomes the fifth challenge. This challenge becomes most apparent in the early phases of a manager's career, when he or she is given line operating responsibilities. If these initial challenges are met, the leader may be in a position of success, which creates its own challenges. Louis Auchincloss' novel, I come as a thief, captures these issues. The seventh issue, seen in the story of Thomas More and King Henry VIII (A man for all seasons), involves balancing high moral principles against pragmatic considerations. Finally, the Sophocles play, Antigone, addresses the need for serious reflection regarding one's life and work. The text is well written and by turns insightful and provocative, and the issues of character he raises are valid as are the questions and observations associated with each.

As modeled, an expected utility of 0.85 was calculated for preemptive vitrectomy compared with 0.79 for deferred vitrectomy for eyes with clinically important vitreous organization.CONCLUSIONSAcute-phase ROP involuted quickly in most eyes. Vitreous organization and vitreous hemorrhage were predictive of eyes that developed a retinal detachment. Decision analysis suggests that preemptive vitrectomy for eyes with vitreous organization meeting specific criteria is not likely to be worse than deferred vitrectomy, and it could be advantageous in some scenarios.",0,1384

American journal of ophthalmology 140(2","PURPOSETo identify specific features during the process of involution of retinopathy of prematurity after treatment at threshold that are associated with development of a retinal detachment.DESIGNRetrospective case series.METHODSThe evolution of retinal detachments over time was analyzed retrospectively in 262 treated eyes of 138 infants. Specific features hypothesized to be associated with development of a retinal detachment were analyzed, including vitreous organization defined as clinically important, active stage 3 disease and active plus disease more than 21 days after treatment, and vitreous hemorrhage defined as clinically important.RESULTSA retinal detachment developed in 36 (13.7%) of 262 eyes. Vitreous organization meeting our clinically important definition was associated with a 31-fold (confidence interval [CI] 5.37-183.63; P < .0001) and 13-fold (CI 2.97-58.59; P < .0001) increase in the odds for retinal detachment for right and left eyes, respectively.

The timing of retinal detachment relative to vitreous hemorrhage was not determined. Prolonged activity of Stage 3 disease or plus disease more than 21 days after treatment was not associated with development of a retinal detachment.CONCLUSIONSClinically important vitreous organization and vitreous hemorrhage were predictive for development of a retinal detachment.

International journal of women's health 9: 619-623.","BACKGROUNDParticipation is an accepted means of increasing the effectiveness of public health programs, and as such, it is considered an important component of HIV interventions targeting at-risk youth. The situation of young women sex workers in Thailand is alarming on many fronts, including that of HIV risk. As a result, HIV programs in Thailand are the key interventions undertaken in relation to young women sex workers' health. A small-scale study used semistructured interviews to explore the participation reports of five young women sex workers, as well as the related views of two community support workers, who lived and worked in Bangkok, Thailand.DISCUSSIONThis study is considered in the light of current research on - as well as new opportunities and challenges offered for - participation by vulnerable groups in the context of digital society. Thematic analysis of the interview data identified barriers to participation, including the illegality of sex work, fear, and lack of trust of the authorities, as well as widespread social stigma. Such barriers resulted in young women seeking anonymity. Yet, promisingly, young women positioned themselves as experts; they are involved in peer education and are supportive of greater involvement in HIV programs, such as further educational initiatives and collective actions.CONCLUSIONThere is a need for a more empowerment-oriented participation practice positioning young women sex workers as expert educators and codecision makers within a model of participation that is also accountable, such as including young women as members of program boards. Beyond current norms, there are new opportunities emerging because of the increasing availability of smartphone/Internet technology. These can support activist and codesign participation by young women sex workers in HIV programs. However, any developments in participation must maximize opportunities carefully, taking into consideration the difficult social environment faced by young women sex workers as well as the need for strategies to address illegality and stigma.",0,1388

Three longitudinal nested models were tested: a need-satisfaction/self-efficacy main effects model, an identity main effects model and a reciprocal main-effects model. The reciprocal effects between the variables were favored by the data. Basic need-satisfaction and career decision making self-efficacy positively predicted proactive exploration and commitment-making, while basic need-frustration predicted both diminished well-being and ill-being.

An exploratory case study design was employed, using open-ended interview questions post-simulation to generate information about the student's perceptions of the experience. Based on the content analysis of reflection articles submitted by 100 students across professions, three themes emerged from the data: increased understanding of the role of other professionals, increased sense of confidence and ability to improve patient outcomes, and increased appreciation for inter-professional simulation as a valuable learning experience. Participants felt a sense of comfort in working as a team, which in turn fostered confidence in their own role.

Journal of environmental management 113: 7-14.","Social learning has become a central theme in natural resource management. This growing interest is underpinned by a number of assertions about the outcomes of social learning, and about the processes that support these outcomes. Yet researchers and practitioners who seek to engage with social learning through the natural resource management literature often become disorientated by the myriad processes and outcomes that are identified. We trace the roots of current assertions about the processes and outcomes of social learning in natural resource management, and assess the extent to which there is an emerging consensus on these assertions. Results suggest that, on the one hand, social learning is described as taking place through deliberative interactions amongst multiple stakeholders. During these interactions, it is argued that participants learn to work together and build relationships that allow for collective action. On the other hand, social learning is described as occurring through deliberate experimentation and reflective practice. During these iterative cycles of action, monitoring and reflection, participants learn how to cope with uncertainty when managing complex systems. Both of these processes, and their associated outcomes, are referred to as social learning. Where, therefore, should researchers and practitioners focus their attention? Results suggest that there is an emerging consensus that processes that support social learning involve sustained interaction between stakeholders, on-going deliberation and the sharing of knowledge in a trusting environment. There is also an emerging consensus that the key outcome of such learning is improved decision making underpinned by a growing awareness of human-environment interactions, better relationships and improved problem-solving capacities for participants.",0,1394

The clinician is also provided a review of how to design eikonic lenses.CASE REPORTA 30-year-old white male presented with symptoms of perceived image size difference after scleral buckle repair for retinal detachment in the right eye. Three measures of aniseikonia resulted in markedly different values, but all indicated larger perceived left eye image. Stereopsis was measured before and after placing an afocal magnifying lens over the right eye. Stereopsis improved immediately upon placement of the afocal lens, with further improvement after 20 minutes, and stereopsis decreased upon removal. The patient reported improved visual comfort for near work with the afocal lens. Eikonic glasses were designed, and the patient reported improved comfort for near work that has remained for over 1 year of wear. Studies evaluating the validity and reliability of the New Aniseikonia Test and the Aniseikonia Inspector are reviewed. Most studies report that induced aniseikonia is underestimated. This case report illustrates that despite the problem with underestimation, these tests are useful clinical tools to identify whether aniseikonia exists and which eye has the larger perceived image. Results can be used as a starting point when making clinical decisions about managing aniseikonia. The Aniseikonia Inspector also assists in the design of eikonic glasses.CONCLUSIONSEven when aniseikonia is substantial, variable in magnitude, and irregular due to retinal disease, reducing the overall aniseikonia can improve binocularity and patient's comfort noticeably for the long term. The underestimation of induced aniseikonia in clinical tests does not preclude their use as a tool in the management of symptomatic aniseikonia.",0,1395

We assessed incidence rates of surgically treated idiopathic RRD among manual workers, non-manual workers and housewives resident in Tuscany, Italy.METHODSWe retrieved all hospital discharge records bearing a principal diagnosis corresponding to RRD coupled with retinal surgery for any resident of Tuscany during 1997-2009. After elimination of repeated admissions and patients with coexistent, associated conditions (including recent trauma), subjects aged 25-59 years were classified as manual workers, non-manual workers or housewives. Population data were extracted from the 2001 census.RESULTSWe identified 1,946 eligible cases (1,142 men). Among men, manual workers experienced a 1.8-fold higher age-standardized rate per 100,000 person-years than non-manual workers [17.4 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 16.1-18.7) vs. 9.8 (95 % CI 8.8-10.8)]. Age-standardized rates among women were 1.9-fold higher for manual workers [11.1 (95 % CI 9.8-12.3)] and 1.7-fold higher for housewives [9.5 (95 % CI 8.3-10.8)] than in non-manual workers [5.7 (95 % CI 4.8-6.6)].CONCLUSIONSThis large population-based study suggests that manual workers are affected by idiopathic RRD requiring surgical treatment more often than non-manual workers.

Methods: Belgian Special Operations Surgical Team applied REBOA in three patients according to a decisional algorithm, based on the MIST acronym used for trauma patients. Only 3 ml, in the first instance, was inflated in the balloon to get AO. The balloon was then progressively deflated, and reperfusion was tracked through changes of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2). Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) before ER-REBOA(R) placement was not higher than 60 mmHg. However, within the first 5 min after AO, SBP improved in all three cases. Due to the aortic compliance, a self-made pREBOA was progressively achieved while proximal SBP was raising with intravenous fluid infusion. Afterwards, during deflation, a steep inflection point was observed in SBP and EtCO2. Conclusions: ER-REBOA(R) is suitable for use in an austere pre-hospital environment. The MIST acronym can be helpful to select the patients for which it could be beneficial. REBOA can also be performed with pREBOA in a dynamic approach, inflating only 3 mL in the balloon and using the aortic compliance. Furthermore, while proximal SBP can be convenient to follow the occlusion, EtCO2 can be seen as an easy and interesting marker to follow the reperfusion.",0,1405

WM training, especially in an emotional context, might help in reducing or preventing these disorders. The current study investigated the direct effects of online emotional WM training on WM capacity, and short- and long-term effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression, and secondary measures of emotional functioning. Methods: Unselected adolescents (n = 168, aged 11–18) were randomised over an active or placebo emotional WM training. WM was assessed before and after 4 weeks of bi-weekly training. Emotional functioning was assessed pre- and post-training and at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Results: Improvements in WM capacity and both shortand long-term emotional functioning were found in both training groups, with the only group difference being a trend for a larger increase in self-esteem in the active group compared to the placebo group. Conclusions: The general improvements irrespective of training condition suggest non-specific training or time effects, or some shared active ingredient in both conditions.

Behaviour Research and Therapy 82: 38-49.","Postnatal depression (PND) confers risk for a range of negative child developmental outcomes, at least in part through its impact on parenting behaviour. Whilst the behavioural effects of depression on parenting are well established, the cognitive mechanisms that may mediate this effect are less well understood. The current paper proposes that rumination may be a key cognitive mechanism through which parenting is affected in PND, and provides a systematic review of the existing literature on rumination in the context of perinatal depression. The review identifies ten relevant papers. Eight are questionnaire-based studies examining the role of rumination in predicting future depression and/or mother-infant relationship outcomes, such as bonding. Two are experimental studies examining the effects of induced rumination on parenting behaviours. The results of the review are discussed, and remaining questions highlighted. We then present a new theoretical model, developed specifically for the perinatal context, and informed by existing models of rumination and worry. Our cognitive model emphasises the relationship between rumination, cognitive biases and cognitive control, and the impact of these variables on infant cue processing and subsequent parenting responses. The model provides a potential framework for future work in this area, and to guide the development of treatment interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1407

PloS one 13(3","The objective of the present paper is to provide experimental evidence of isolated resonances in the frequency response of nonlinear mechanical systems. More specifically, this work explores the presence of isolas, which are periodic solutions detached from the main frequency response, in the case of a nonlinear set-up consisting of two masses sliding on a horizontal guide. A careful experimental investigation of isolas is carried out using responses to swept-sine and stepped-sine excitations. The experimental findings are validated with advanced numerical simulations combining nonlinear modal analysis and bifurcation monitoring. In particular, the interactions between two nonlinear normal modes are shown to be responsible for the creation of the isolas.",0,1408

BMC research notes 8: 741.","BACKGROUNDMedical education can play important role in cultivating the willingness among the medical students to work in underprivileged areas after their graduation. Experiential learning through early exposure to primary health care centers could help students better understand the opportunities and challenges of such settings. However, the information on the real experiences and reflections of medical students on the rural primary health care settings from low-income countries like Nepal are still limited. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the learning process of the medical students through their reflective writings based on Kolb's theory of experiential learning.METHODSThe students wrote their experiences, observations and reflections on the experiential learning from the primary health care centers on individual logbook as part of their community posting assignments. We analyzed the data of 50 logbooks through content analysis using Kolb's experiential learning cycle as a theoretical framework.RESULTSThe students' reflections are structured around the four main learning stages of Kolb's experiential learning theory. Each learning stage consisted of different categories. The first stage consisted of concrete experiences on rural health and learning by doing. The second stage included their reflective observations on primary versus tertiary care, application of theoretical knowledge and role of supervisors. In the third stage, the students developed and refined their concepts on self-development, understanding reality, compassion and sense of responsibility. The final stage, active experimentation, included their immediate future plans, suggestions to improve curriculum, plans after becoming a doctor and suggestions to improve policies.CONCLUSIONThis study provided important insights on different stages of experiential learning of medical students on primary health care in low resource rural settings. Reflective writing of experiential learning could be an important step to address the gaps in medical education for resource constraint settings like that of Nepal and other low-income countries.",0,1409

Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry 93(5","PURPOSEChoroidal metastasis from bladder cancer is very rare, with only a handful of cases cited previously in the literature. We present a case of a patient who presented with a serous retinal detachment and a known history of bladder cancer, which he believed was controlled. Based on the clinical evaluation, his history of bladder cancer, and a retinal consult, a workup was initiated and he was found to have choroidal metastasis from his cancer.CASE REPORTA 77-year-old white man presented with a 1-week history of blurry vision in his left eye and left-sided frontal headaches. His medical history was significant for medically managed hypertension and controlled bladder cancer, which had been treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical treatments. The patient had been a smoker for 35 years but had quit 22 years before presentation. A dilated retinal examination found an inferior serous retinal detachment in the left eye, with areas of subretinal folds and fluid encroaching on the macula on both clinical examination and optical coherence tomography imaging. The patient was diagnosed as having an exudative retinal detachment in his left eye, and he was referred for a retinal consult. Subsequent testing with B-scan and fluorescein angiography was suggestive of metastasis as the cause of the exudative detachment. Based on his history of bladder cancer, a chest X-ray was ordered and revealed a left-sided pleural effusion. A chest computed tomography confirmed the left pleural effusion and better visualized its extent. A thoracentesis with cytology supported the diagnosis of metastases from urothelial carcinoma. The patient's bladder cancer was now classified as stage 4, and he died 2 months later.CONCLUSIONSThis case highlights a rare instance of a choroidal metastasis from bladder cancer. As with previous cases, this is a poor prognostic sign for the patient's survival, and he died shortly after the discovery of the lesion. It is important to consider cancer metastasis in the differential diagnosis when presented with a serous retinal detachment and a known cancer diagnosis, even if the patient believes that his cancer is well managed.",0,1410

Psychological Medicine 39(1","Background: The experience of uncontrollability and helplessness in the face of stressful life events is regarded as an important determinant in the development and maintenance of depression. The inability to successfully deal with stressors might be linked to dysfunctional prefrontal functioning. We assessed cognitive, behavioural and physiological effects of stressor uncontrollability in depressed and healthy individuals. In addition, relationships between altered cortical processing and cognitive vulnerability traits of depression were analysed. Method: A total of 26 unmedicated depressed patients and 24 matched healthy controls were tested in an expanded forewarned reaction (S1-S2) paradigm. In a factorial design, stressor controllability varied across three consecutive conditions: (a) control, (b) loss of control and (c) restitution of control. Throughout the experiment, error rates, ratings of controllability, arousal, emotional valence and helplessness were assessed together with the post-imperative negative variation (PINV) of the electroencephalogram. Results: Depressed participants showed an enhanced frontal PINV as an electrophysiological index of altered information processing during both loss of control and restitution of control. They also felt more helpless than controls. Furthermore, frontal PINV magnitudes were associated with habitual rumination in the depressed subsample. Conclusions: These findings indicate that depressed patients are more susceptible to stressor uncontrollability than healthy subjects. Moreover, the experience of uncontrollability seems to bias subsequent information processing in a situation where control is objectively re-established. Alterations in prefrontal functioning appear to contribute to this vulnerability and are also linked to trait markers of depression.

Non-adherence to lifelong immunosuppressants presents a significant risk for graft loss, yet rates remain consistently high. Despite a number of these patients presenting for retransplantation, there is little evidence to guide professionals in their decision-making. This paper aims to provide such guidance, by systematically reviewing the existing outcome data for retransplantation in patients who are known to be non-adherent to their immunosuppressants. This review searched for original papers that addressed retransplantation of a solid organ and included quantitative data on adherence or graft function. Only one original research paper was found to meet the inclusion criteria. This paper is reviewed, and details of the protocol to determine eligibility for retransplantation are summarized. The findings are discussed within the ethical context that transplant professionals work within, and the arguments for and against retransplantation are considered. The need for effective integration of adherence management into routine practice is highlighted, with an emphasis on reliable measurement of adherence throughout the patient's life.

Advances in pediatrics 53: 211-226.","ROP is a blinding eye disease of premature infants that affects more than 80% of babies born with birthweight less than 1000 g. With the current understanding of etiology and treatment, all infants born at less than 1500 g should receive regular ROP eye examinations starting at 4 weeks chronologic age or 31 weeks postconceptional age, whichever is later. The examinations should proceed every 1 to 2 weeks, sometimes even more frequently, until resolution of the ROP, or until treatment is needed. About 8% of premature infants can be expected to require treatment overall; the percentage may be closer to 25% of those born at less than 750 g. Babies who require treatment are not out of the woods; close ophthalmologic follow up is needed short-term and long-term. Even infants whose disease resolves without treatment will need regular eye examinations at least throughout early childhood. Although the rate of blindness from ROP has dropped since the years before any treatment was available, there are many new cases of blindness each year from this disorder, and it remains a leading cause of childhood blindness and visual disability in the United States. One can envision a day when NICUs will be much smaller, because premature birth has been reduced in frequency. The newborn premature infants will have genetic testing to see whether they are at high risk for ROP based on genotype. Computerized risk analysis will aid in planning a course of action. If there is a predisposition for severe ROP, frequent eye examinations, perhaps with an automated system that does not touch the eye or stress the infant, will be done. Antigrowth factor and antiangiogenesis medication may be administered to the eyes. Certain systemic drugs or medications may be avoided, while others are instituted. Oxygen tension will be monitored precisely. When this day has come, the laborious task of weekly eye examinations with an indirect ophthalmoscope and destruction of the peripheral retina to save the center will be of historical interest only. Until then, one can work toward the future, but be thankful now that the rate of blindness from ROP has dropped, thanks to close surveillance, improved understanding of natural history, and a treatment that, while not perfect, is remarkably effective in preserving central vision.",0,1415

Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience 10: 57-76.","Rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) has increased in size and changed in terms of its cellular organisation during primate evolution. In parallel emerged the ability to detach oneself from the immediate environment to process abstract thoughts and solve problems and to understand other individuals’ thoughts and intentions. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is thought to play an important role in supporting the integration of abstract, often self-generated, thoughts. Thoughts can be temporally abstract and relate to long term goals, or past or future events, or relationally abstract and focus on the relationships between representations rather than simple stimulus features. Behavioural studies have provided evidence of a prolonged development of the cognitive functions associated with RLPFC, in particular logical and relational reasoning, but also episodic memory retrieval and prospective memory. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies provide further support for a prolonged development of RLPFC during adolescence, with some evidence of increased specialisation of RLPFC activation for relational integration and aspects of episodic memory retrieval. Topics for future research will be discussed, such as the role of medial RPFC in processing abstract thoughts in the social domain, the possibility of training abstract thinking in the domain of reasoning, and links to education.

Educational Technology Research and Development 62(6","Critical thinking (CT) is a metacognitive process, consisting of a number of sub-skills and dispositions, that, when used appropriately, increases the chances of producing a logical solution to a problem or a valid conclusion to an argument. CT has been identified as a fundamental learning objective of third-level education; however, students often report not being given the opportunity to adequately understand and cultivate CT skills. Though most CT interventions are designed based on academic or expert definitions of CT skills, students are rarely, if ever, asked to guide their instruction by describing their perspectives on what constitutes CT. The current case study investigated students’ conceptualisations of what constitutes good CT using a collective intelligence methodology, interactive management. Interactive management (IM) is a computer-assisted process that allows a group to build a structural model describing relations between elements in a system. Though decades of research on group decision-making in educational and social psychology highlight the many limitations associated with group problem solving (e.g. as a result of an over-reliance on heuristics, cognitive biases and ‘groupthink’), a fundamental skill for making decisions and solving problems is the ability to collectively visualise the structure of a shared problem, and use this knowledge to design solutions and strategies for collective action. Results of IM group work from the current case study revealed five core CT skills (clarity of expression, conversational skill, inference, evaluation, and explanation), five CT dispositions (detachment, listening, systematicity, recognising uncertainty, and self-questioning) and fourteen structural relationships among them. The ability to detach, listen and engage in conversation with others, were seen as fundamental drivers of all other competencies in the system. Results are discussed in light of research and theory on CT and best practice for CT instruction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1418

JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports 14(4","BACKGROUNDTeamwork is seen as an important element of patient care in acute hospital settings. The complexity of the journey of care for patients highlights the need for health professionals to collaborate and communicate clearly with each other. Health organizations in western countries are committed to improving patient safety through education of staff and teamwork education programs have been integral to this focus. There are no current systematic reviews of the experience of health professionals who participate in teamwork education in acute hospital settings.OBJECTIVESThe objective of this systematic review was to search for the best available evidence on the experiences of health professionals who participate in teamwork education in acute hospital settings.INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTSThis review considered studies reporting on experiences of registered health professionals who work in acute hospitals. This included medical, nursing and midwifery and allied health professionals.PHENOMENA OF INTERESTThe focus of the meta-synthesis was the experiences and reflections of health professionals who were involved in teamwork education in acute hospital settings.CONTEXTThe geographical context for this review was acute hospitals in rural or metropolitan settings in Australia and overseas countries. The review focused on the experiences of health professionals who work in acute hospitals and participated in teamwork education programs.TYPES OF STUDIESThis review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research.In the absence of research studies, other text such as opinion papers, discussion papers and reports were considered. Studies published in English and from 1990 to 2013 were included in this review.SEARCH STRATEGYThe literature search for relevant papers occurred between 13 September and 26 October 2013. A three-step search strategy was utilized in this review. The databases searched were PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and Scopus.METHODOLOGICAL QUALITYThe standardized critical appraisal tool the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) was used to assess the methodological quality of included papers.DATA EXTRACTIONData that included statements and text of interest was extracted from papers included in the study using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI.DATA SYNTHESISQualitative research findings were pooled using JBI-QARI. This involved the aggregation and synthesis of findings to generate a set of statements that represented that aggregation.RESULTSIn total, 116 papers were selected for analysis of full text, 11 papers were selected for critical appraisal and seven papers were selected for data synthesis. This resulted in 44 findings. The findings were assigned to 16 categories based on identified similarities across the papers. The categories were integrated into six meta-syntheses. These were: Meta-synthesis One: It is important to recognize that organizational culture and expectations have an impact on health professionals' participation and experience of teamwork education. Meta-synthesis Two: Understanding how successful teams function is central to the development of teamwork education programs and the experience of participants. Meta-synthesis Three: A health professional's experience of teamwork education will be influenced by his/her starting point of learning. Meta-synthesis Four: Participants highly value teamwork education programs that are implemented by facilitators who create practical authentic learning opportunities and foster reflection and debriefing for participants. Meta-synthesis Five: High fidelity simulation used with specific communication strategies provides a powerful learning opportunity for health professions to practice teamwork skills. Meta-synthesis Six: Participants have increased confidence and are motivated to apply their newly learnt teamwork skills into their daily practice.CONCLUSIONS he review identified qualitative evidence that can guide organizations and education facilitators in the development and implementation of teamwork education in acute hospital settings. Although the quality of the specific teamwork education programs was an important factor, there were a number of issues that also impacted on the experiences of health professionals who participated in teamwork education programs. These included the context that the program was delivered in, the diversity of health care teams, starting points of individual learners, the type of tools utilized in education programs, the levels of confidence and motivation of learners post training and the opportunity to transfer into practice new learning.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICEDrawing from the synthesized findings of the review, recommendations for practice have been devised in order to guide the development and implementation of teamwork education in acute hospital settings and to improve the experience of participating health professionals. The Joanna Briggs Institute utilizes Grades of Recommendation to rate a health management strategy in terms of its desirable effects, evidence of adequate quality supporting its use, benefits of use, and the inclusion of patient experience, values and preferences. A strong recommendation has a Grade A and a weak recommendation has a Grade B. The FAME (Feasibility, Appropriateness, Meaningfulness and Effectiveness) scale was used to inform the strength of the following six recommendations for practice from the review: RECOMMENDATION ONE: All members of a team should be encouraged by their organization/managers to participate in teamwork education programs in order to foster a positive culture of learning and teamwork within the team.JBI Recommendation: Grade A. This recommendation is appropriate and applicable to all health professionals in acute hospital settings, is associated with positive experiences for participants of teamwork education programs and has a beneficial effect on participants.RECOMMENDATION TWOFacilitators of teamwork education programs should understand how successful teams function and consider these factors when planning or delivering training.JBI Recommendation: Grade A. This recommendation is associated with positive experiences for participants and creates a beneficial effect to the quality of a teamwork education program.RECOMMENDATION THREEFacilitators of teamwork education programs need to explore participant learning needs and their prior experiences of working in teams before implementing teamwork education programs.JBI Recommendation: Grade A. This recommendation creates a beneficial effect to the participants of teamwork education programs and to the quality of education provided by facilitators.RECOMMENDATION FOURFacilitators of teamwork education programs should provide learning opportunities that are practical, authentic to participants and foster constructive debriefing and reflection.JBI Recommendation: Grade A. This recommendation is applicable to all health professionals and circumstances in which teamwork education occurs, is associated with positive experiences and has a beneficial effect on participants.RECOMMENDATION FIVEHigh fidelity simulation should be considered in acute hospitals for the training of teamwork skills in addition to clinical skills. Scenarios provide realistic opportunities for participants to practice communication strategies that enhance teamwork.JBI Recommendation: Grade A. This recommendation is applicable to all health professionals and circumstances in which teamwork education occurs and has a beneficial effect on participants of education programs.RECOMMENDATION SIXTeam managers should harness the new confidence and motivation of staff around teamwork skills following participation in teamwork education programs and ensure that there are opportunities in the workplace to apply new skills and knowledge into daily practice.JBI Recommendation: Grade A. This recommendation is applicable to all health professionals and circumstances in which teamwork ed cation occurs, is adaptable to a variety of circumstances and has a beneficial effect on health professional's daily practice of teamwork skills.IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCHIn order to strengthen the evidence base about teamwork education in acute hospital settings there needs to be quantitative and qualitative research into:How organizations that have successfully embedded a culture of collaboration and safety in health teams have planned, implemented and evaluated teamwork education programs in acute hospital settings?What are the characteristics of teams that have led to successful participation in teamwork education and positive outcomes for team performance?What are the experiences, training and support provided to education facilitators who successfully implement teamwork education programs in acute hospitals?",0,1420

Global public health 9(1-2","Mounting concerns over aid effectiveness have rendered 'ownership' a central concept in the vocabulary of development assistance for health (DAH). The article investigates the application of both 'national ownership' and 'country ownership' in the broader development discourse as well as more specifically in the context of internationally funded HIV/AIDS interventions. Based on comprehensive literature reviews, the research uncovers a multiplicity of definitions, most of which either divert from or plainly contradict the concept's original meaning and intent. During the last 10 years in particular, it appears that both public and private donors have advocated for greater 'ownership' by recipient governments and countries to hedge their own political risk rather than to work towards greater inclusion of the latter in agenda-setting and programming. Such politically driven semantic dynamics suggest that the concept's salience is not merely a discursive reflection of globally skewed power relations in DAH but a deliberate exercise in limiting donors' accountabilities. At the same time, the research also finds evidence that this conceptual contortion frames current global public health scholarship, thus adding further urgency to the need to critically re-evaluate the international political economy of global public health from a discursive perspective.",0,1424

1426,"Faedda, G. L., et al. (2015"," ""Depressive mixed states: A reappraisal of koukopoulos'criteria."" Journal of Affective Disorders 176: 18-23.","Background: Mixed states have been a fundamental part of Kraepelin's conceptualization of the manic-depressive illness. However, after Kraepelin, the study of mixed states was not of great interest, until the publication of the RDC criteria (1978) and then the DSM-III edition (1980), where criteria for mixed manic states were operationalized. The most notable victims of DSM nosology were depressive mixed states, in particular depression with flight of ideas and excited (agitated) depression. Methods: We briefly review the clinical work of Athanasios Koukopoulos on depressive mixed states (in particular agitated depression) pointing out the diagnostic and therapeutic contributions, especially in the lights of Koukopoulos' first description of depressive mixed syndrome in 1992. Results: The mixed depressive syndrome is not a transitory state but a state of long duration, which may last weeks or several months. The clinical picture is characterized by dysphoric mood, emotional lability, psychic and/or motor agitation, talkativeness, crowded and/or racing thoughts, rumination, initial or middle insomnia. Impulsive suicidal attempts may be frequent. The family observes incessant complaints, irritability, occasional verbal outbursts, occasional physical aggression, and occasional hypersexuality. Treatment with antipsychotics and ECT is very effective; antidepressants can worsen the clinical picture. Limitations: Selective but not systematic review of the literature on depressive mixed states.

ACS applied materials & interfaces 4(9","A series of Bi(2)O(3)/BaTiO(3) composite photocatalysts with different mass ratios of Bi(2)O(3) vs BaTiO(3) were prepared by an impregnating-annealing method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM), and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) confirmed that Bi(2)O(3) and BaTiO(3) coexisted in the composites. The results of surface photovoltage (SPV) experiments showed enhancements of photovoltaic response in composites, which indicated a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charges due to the establishment of an efficient interfacial electric field between Bi(2)O(3) and BaTiO(3) in the composites. The consistency of phtocatalytic activity and photovoltaic response intensity of photocatalysts showed that the efficiency interfacial electric field between Bi(2)O(3) and BaTiO(3) played an important role in improving the degradation efficiency of Rhodamine B (RhB). The 60%-Bi(2)O(3)/BaTiO(3) sample with the best activity was found by optimizing the mass ratios of Bi(2)O(3) vs. BaTiO(3). On the basis of the work function (WF) measurements, a reasonable energy band diagram was proposed for BaTiO(3)/Bi(2)O(3) composite.

Accompanying this shift is a growing body of literature describing the advantages or disadvantages of using isoflurane or sevoflurane for long term sedation. This practise requires a cost effective, efficient and safe means to deliver these drugs that can simultaneously operate with modern critical care ventilators and ventilation protocols while protecting the care environment and care workers from excessive exposure to the drugs. The anaesthetic conserving device (""AnaConDa"", Sedana Medical) is one device that delivers a safe sedative dose of either isoflurane or sevoflurane to a patient using existing critical care ventilators, common syringe pumps and gas monitors. The device is essentially a small disposable anaesthetic vaporizer and HME filter combined into one airway component. Similar to an HME filter, the device reflects moisture back to the patient, but also reflects 90% of the anaesthetic by adsorbing and releasing the drug using a proprietary carbon filament reflecting medium. This reflection reduces the total amount of anaesthetic needed, reducing that which is exhausted or scavenged upon exhalation. It can be used for 24 h of sedation, and fits into current critical care ventilator circuits almost without modifications.

However, no work to date has examined the neural mechanisms connecting stress-reactive rumination and adolescent depressive symptoms. The present work attempted to bridge this gap through an fMRI study of 41 adolescent girls (Mage = 15.42, SD = 0.33)—a population in whom elevated levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, and social stress sensitivity are displayed. During the scan, participants completed two tasks: an emotion regulation task and a social stress task. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we found that positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the emotion regulation task mediated the association between stress-reactive rumination and depressive symptoms. These results suggest that stress-reactive rumination may interfere with the expression and development of neural connectivity patterns associated with effective emotion regulation, which may contribute, in turn, to heightened depressive symptoms.

Analyses of the first 13 parts of the questionnaire are presented in this report.RESULTSThe majority of V-R surgeons (59%) practise in teaching hospitals. There are greater numbers of V-R surgeons per unit in teaching hospitals as compared to District General Hospitals (DGHs). Ophthalmic theatre and ophthalmic theatre staff availability are theoretically high (92.3% and 84.6% respectively) and evenly distributed between teaching hospitals and DGHs, but in reality, access may be difficult. Most V-R surgeons take part in an on-call rota with general ophthalmology colleagues. This formal commitment may be infrequent. Only a small proportion of V-R surgeons (28.3%) officially provide a continuous fixed on-call V-R rota, though in practice, a larger proportion do seem to provide this type of cover informally. Most V-R fellows are located in teaching hospitals (89.5%), and are usually on either a formal or informal on-call rota. Only one unit has a formal continuous on-call rota for fellows allowing no more than 72 hours duty per week.

The method employs changes in the P-O-R stretching vibration of DFP and nerve agent substrates when hydrolyzed to their corresponding phosphoric and phosphonic acids. It is shown that the Lambert-Beer law holds and that changes in absorbance can be directly related to changes in concentration. Compared with other methods, the use of in situ FTIR spectroscopy results in a substantially reduced reaction volume that adds extra work safety when handling highly toxic substrates.

In this study, a toxic and a photodynamic effect of ICG at the vitreoretinal interface was assumed.METHODSTen human donor eyes were hemisected, and 0.05 mL of 0.05% ICG was poured over the trephined macula in eight eyes. After 1 minute, the dye was drained by irrigation. The macula in each of two eyes was illuminated for 3 minutes with wavelengths of 380 to 760, 380 to 620, or 620 to 760 nm. Two eyes were treated with ICG only, and two eyes were illuminated only. Retinal specimens from the macula and the untreated retina were processed for light and electron microscopy. The irradiance of the light source and the absorption properties of ICG were measured.RESULTSExposure of the ICG-stained ILM to wavelengths beyond 620 nm resulted in severe damage to the inner retina, including loss of ILM, cellular disorganization, and fragmentation of the cytoplasm. ICG staining alone or in combination with wavelengths of 380 to 620 nm disclosed rupture of Müller cells with detachment of the ILM, but no other cellular disorganization. Eyes subjected to illumination only showed no abnormalities.CONCLUSIONSThe spectral absorption properties of ICG may account for a possible photodynamic effect of ICG at the vitreoretinal interface. ICG alone induces ILM detachment and disruption of Müller cells even without intentional peeling of the membrane. It is assumed that accumulation of the dye at the vitreomacular interface may enhance the concentration and osmolarity of ICG at the retina beyond intravitreous values and critical limits.",0,1452

Anxiety, Stress & Coping: An International Journal.","Objective: Occupational accidents are highly stressful events that frequently occur and impact both the physical and mental health of workers. The aim of this study was to longitudinally assess a predictive model of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in workers who have suffered a recent accident. Method: Two hundred and forty-four workers (77.8% men), aged 18 to 73 years, who had experienced an accident during the last month that resulted in hospitalization and/or ten or more days of sick leave, were surveyed. A second survey was carried out six months later. Regression analyses included psychological predictors (i.e. subjective severity of event, brooding and positive and negative religious coping), along with objective predictors (i.e. hospitalization, sick leave days and unemployment). Results: It was found that the main predictors of PTSS were brooding, negative religious coping, days of sick leave and unemployment, with a large effect size (R2 = .45). Conclusions: The discussion is based on the usefulness of including selected psychological and objective predictors for detecting people more susceptible to developing psychopathology due to the stress following an accident. Identifying at-risk people for developing PTSS after an accident may help to introduce selective preventive strategies or early interventions in this population.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a visual dental anatomy teaching tool to train dental students to self-assess their dental anatomy wax carving practical examinations. The students self-assessed two waxing practical examinations (tooth #8 and tooth #19) using high-quality digital images in an assessment tool incorporated into a digital testing program. Student self-assessments were compared to the faculty evaluations and the results of a software-based evaluation tool (E4D Compare). Out of a total 130 first-year dental students at one U.S. dental school, wax-ups from 57 participants were available for this study. The assessment data were submitted to statistical analyses (p<0.05). For tooth #8, the student self-assessments were significantly different from the faculty and software assessments at a 400 micrometer level of tolerance (p=0.036), whereas the faculty assessment was not significantly different from the software assessment at a 300 micrometer level of tolerance (p=0.69). The evaluation of tooth #19 resulted in no significant differences between faculty members (p=0.94) or students (p=0.21) and the software at a level of tolerance of 400 micrometers.

The workshops are part of a larger socio-educational project targeting adolescent school dropout. The audio-visual products of the workshops—raps produced by adolescents in their English, intertwined with other linguistic resources in their repertoires—are analysed for local processes of identity production and linguistic ideologies. The analysis suggests that Hip Hop, as a popular, non-institutionalised culture, allows for counter-narratives of teenagers’ plurilingualism and their everyday language experiences. The students’ raps interrogate linguistic ideologies in education as detached from popular culture and their local, urban communities. By and large, the students’ linguistic performances are non-standard, playful and linguistically fluid, contrary to the norm in mainstream educational contexts. The Hip Hop based intervention thus provided a space for transgression from traditional notions of language education compatible with Critical Hip Hop Language Pedagogies (CHHLP) and pedagogies of plurilingualism.

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges 77(9","OBJECTIVEIf faculty development programs are to have impact, we believe they should be made up of several self-reinforcing workshops that provide opportunities for behavior review, practice, reflection, and reinforcement within a context of interdisciplinary perspectives. A program was developed that supports these four activities and includes clinical faculty from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and pharmacy.DESCRIPTIONAt the University of Illinois at Chicago we have focused our efforts to improve clinical teaching through a program of two parallel courses. One course focuses on the ""one-minute teacher"" approach to clinical teaching. We call this course ""Teaching-on-the-Fly,"" reflecting what many of our faculty attendees have suggested they do. The second course is ""Feedback Strategies."" The two courses are identical in format, which is a series of three three-to-four-hour small-group workshops of not more than eight participants. The first two workshops in each series are titled ""Teaching-on-the-Fly I and II"" and ""Feedback Strategies I and II,"" respectively. Workshop I is separated from Workshop II by two weeks. During this hiatus faculty are urged to practice the skills learned and to reflect on what worked and what did not work in Workshop I. Six months following both series' Workshop II, ""Advanced Teaching-on-the-Fly"" and ""Advanced Feedback Strategies"" workshops are held. Each workshop begins with videotaping of two separate teaching encounters in which each participant interacts with standardized students. Standardized student and clinical faculty interactions are meant to mimic typical teaching and feedback situations. Teaching encounters are limited to five minutes, maximizing the similarity to the stress and frenetic quality of many of today's clinical settings. In Workshop II and in the advanced workshops the standardized students offer one positive comment to the faculty immediately following their encounter. Students are taught how to give this feedback. Immediately after videotaping, faculty adjourn to a small-group discussion. Workshops consist of reflective discussions during the review of each participant's videotape, brief lectures, and responsive comments and instruction by the workshop leaders. Participants are asked to reflect on each workshop and to bring examples of problems and opportunities gained to succeeding workshops in the series.DISCUSSIONSeveral theories support these clinical teaching workshops. (1) Outcomes research in continuing medical education suggests the need for ongoing reinforcement, which we do structurally through the three-session model. (2) We use a classical microteaching approach to develop insight and self-awareness. Each videotaped encounter is reviewed, stopped at key points, and discussed by the entire group. These discussions commonly open up after the workshop leaders ask questions such as, ""What were you thinking there?"" or ""What were you trying to do?"" or ""What would you ask next?"" (3) We emphasize the importance of knowing-in-action and the related reflection that guides action in practice. (4) The quality of the workshops is enhanced using standardized students, whom we carefully train and use repeatedly. At least two students have worked with us from their first years through their final clinical years. We are currently examining the program's impact through videotape review.",0,1459

There had been construction work adjacent to the theatres during this time, and fine dust was found on horizontal surfaces. Further surgery was cancelled, the construction work was completed and theatres were cleaned before recommencing with no further infections. Following a review of factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis, it is proposed that the mechanism of infection in these cases may have been due to the presence of foreign material enhancing the pathogenicity of the small numbers of organisms often found in intra-ocular fluids during surgery. This hypothesis could be tested in experimental models of endophthalmitis.",0,1461

African journal of AIDS research : AJAR 15(2","Ending intimate partner violence (IPV) and reducing gender inequalities are recognised as critical to ""'ending AIDS"" by 2030. Amongst women, experiencing IPV has been shown to increase HIV acquisition, reduce women's ability to use HIV prevention strategies and reduce adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Southern and Eastern Africa there has recently been a significant push to strengthen programming around this through broad funding and programming streams. However, while gender inequality underpins IPV and HIV acquisition, in different contexts a variety of other factors intersect to shape this vulnerability. Using reflections focused on young women living in urban informal settlements and the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention, this paper illustrates the need to understand the specific drivers of HIV and IPV in any given context and the need for interventions to prevent this. Any intervention needs to include three key components: 1) resonate with the lived realities of women they target; 2) tackle multiple factors shaping women's vulnerability to IPV and HIV simultaneously; and 3) consider how best to work with men and boys to achieve improved outcomes for women. Such an approach, it is argued, resonating with the ""slow research"" movement, will yield better outcomes for interventions, but will also require a fundamental rethinking of how interventions to prevent IPV and HIV amongst women are conceptualised, with a greater emphasis on understanding the ways in which gender resonates in each context and how interventions can operate.",0,1462

Mindfulness 4(4","Mindfulness training is increasingly being recommended as a means of fostering clinical skill development as well as stress reduction among trainees in the helping professions. However, existing mindfulness training protocols are often lengthy, making it challenging to integrate them into standard curricula, and mindfulness-based interventions have not yet been adapted to address clinical training goals. We conducted a mixed-methods study to investigate the effects of integrating a small dose of mindfulness training—only 10 min per session—into a clinical interviewing class with a new population, namely beginning social work students. Results demonstrated that students valued the training, saw it as relevant to their role as a clinical practitioner, and continued to draw on the training once they transitioned to their work with clients in the field. Students in the intervention group reported significant changes in counseling self-efficacy, but not in well-being in comparison to a nonrandomized cohort control group at posttest. Students’ long-term engagement in mindfulness practice at program entry was correlated with their degree of improvement in counseling self-efficacy over the course of the training. The results of this study suggest that even small doses of mindfulness training that do not appreciably alter students’ well-being may nevertheless play a role in fostering clinical skill development. Student responses to open-ended questions in the intervention group revealed that they drew on mindfulness to increase their ability to be present, open, and emotionally available and responsive to their clients in session. Students identified mindfulness as key to their clinical learning process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1464

Although the properties of neurite (particularly axonal) outgrowth have been extensively studied in retinal ganglion cells, comparatively little work has been done with other retinal neurons. The goal of the present research is to explore the survival and neurite outgrowth properties of a specific type of retinal cell, the rod bipolar cell (RBC), using in vitro culture preparations. RBCs are the most numerous of the several classes of bipolar cells in mammals, and would be a likely target of stimulation by any subretinal implant. We report here that RBCs in short term culture--as isolated cells or within retinal explants--extend their dendrites, and that these are often decorated with varicosities and smaller spine-like extensions. This response is similar to remodeling of RBCs observed in cat models of retinal detachment, and suggests it might be possible to manipulate RBCs with appropriate growth and guidance cues to form an optimal interface with subretinal devices or transplants.",0,1466

Background: Individuals with clinical depression suffer from distortion of attention and rumination. Interventions can help to disrupt maladaptive rumination and promote restoration of depleted attentional capacity. Method: A single-group study was conducted with a convenience sample of 28 people with clinical depression in 2009. Data were collected before, twice during, and immediately after a 12-week therapeutic horticulture programme, and at 3-month follow-up. Assessment instruments were the Beck Depression Inventory, Attentional Function Index, Brooding Scale, and Being Away and Fascination subscales from the Perceived Restorativeness Scale. Findings: Mean Beck Depression Inventory scores declined by 4·5 points during the intervention (F = 5·49, P = 0·002). The decline was clinically relevant for 50% of participants. Attentional Function Index scores increased (F = 4·14, P = 0·009), while Brooding scores decreased (F = 4·51, P = 0·015). The changes in Beck Depression Inventory and Attentional Function Index scores were mediated by increases in Being Away and Fascination, and decline in Beck Depression Inventory scores was also mediated by decline in Brooding.

Two coders independently analyzed a randomly selected subset of de-identified reflections (78 of 170) to describe predominant themes.RESULTSDuring preceptorship, students interacted with patients affected by wide-ranging diseases, from diabetes to multiple sclerosis, within primary care and specialty clinical settings located in geographically diverse regions. Drawing on personal experience and interviews with patients and physicians, students reported benefits of continuity of care for patients and physicians concordant with claims from the literature, including improved medical management, better interpersonal communication, increased patient compliance, and higher levels of trust. Students also offered perspectives regarding challenges of and impediments to providing continuity of care, including managed care and work hour constraints, lack of comprehensive coordinated services, and specialty-driven care.CONCLUSIONSPreclinical medical students are able to identify both benefits and barriers to continuity of care.

PloS one 13(8","BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by repetitive thinking and high rates of depression. Understanding the extent to which repetitive negative thinking in ASD reflects autistic stereotypy versus general depressive thinking patterns (e.g., rumination) could help guide treatment research to improve emotional health in ASD. We compared associations between rumination, depressive symptoms, and pupil response to social-emotional material in adults with ASD and typically developing (TD) adults with and without depression. METHODS: N = 53 verbally fluent young adults were recruited to three cohorts: ASD, n = 21; TD-depressed, n = 13; never-depressed TD-controls, n = 19. Participants completed Ruminative Response Scale and Beck Depression Inventory self-reports and a passive-viewing task employing emotionally-expressive faces, during which pupillary motility was assessed to quantify cognitive-affective load. Main and interactive effects of cohort, emotion condition, and time on pupil amplitude were tested via a linear mixed effects analysis of variance using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Similar procedures were used to test for effects of rumination and depressive symptoms on pupil amplitude over time within ASD. RESULTS: Responsive pupil dilation in the ASD cohort tended to be significantly lower than TD-depressed initially but increased to comparable levels by trial end. When viewing sad faces, individuals with ASD who had higher depression scores resembled TD-depressed participants' faster, larger, and sustained pupil response. Within ASD, depressive symptoms uniquely predicted early pupil response to sad faces, while rumination and depression scores each independently predicted sustained pupil response. CONCLUSIONS: People with elevated depressive symptoms appear to have faster and greater increases in pupil-indexed neural activation following sad stimuli, regardless of ASD status, suggesting the utility of conceptualizing rumination as depression-like in treatment. Ruminative processes may increase more slowly in ASD, suggesting the potential utility of interventions that decrease reactions before they are uncontrollable. Findings also reinforce the importance of testing for effects of internalizing variables in broader ASD research.",0,1472

Twenty-two oncologists were interviewed between March 2013 and June 2014 from three adult oncology centers in the north, center, and south of Israel. Oncologists were at different stages of their careers and varied in their sub-specialties, gender, and personal and professional backgrounds. Results: Grief begun when the patient died, in anticipation of the patient’s death, many days after the death, or when the patient received a poor prognosis. The phenomenological experience of grief for oncologists included behavioral, cognitive, physical, and emotional symptoms in response to patient death. Behavioral symptoms included crying and difficulties sleeping. Cognitive symptoms included self-doubt and rumination about the patient and the care the patient had received before death. Physical symptoms included chest pain, fatigue, and general physical discomfort. Emotional symptoms included sadness, anxiety, helplessness, guilt, relief, irritability, and loss. Difficult patient loss was caused by patient-related factors, family-related factors, and disease-related factors. Conclusions: Patient deaths result in behavioral, cognitive, physical, and emotional symptoms of grief in oncologists. These symptoms become particularly intense in the context of patient, family, and disease-related factors.

BMC medical education 7: 5.","BACKGROUNDPortfolio learning enables students to collect evidence of their learning. Component tasks making up a portfolio can be devised that relate directly to intended learning outcomes. Reflective tasks can stimulate students to recognise their own learning needs. Assessment of portfolios using a rating scale relating to intended learning outcomes offers high content validity. This study evaluated a reflective portfolio used during a final-year attachment in general practice (family medicine). Students were asked to evaluate the portfolio (which used significant event analysis as a basis for reflection) as a learning tool. The validity and reliability of the portfolio as an assessment tool were also measured.METHODS81 final-year medical students completed reflective significant event analyses as part of a portfolio created during a three-week attachment (clerkship) in general practice (family medicine). As well as two reflective significant event analyses each portfolio contained an audit and a health needs assessment. Portfolios were marked three times; by the student's GP teacher, the course organiser and by another teacher in the university department of general practice. Inter-rater reliability between pairs of markers was calculated. A questionnaire enabled the students' experience of portfolio learning to be determined.RESULTSBenefits to learning from reflective learning were limited. Students said that they thought more about the patients they wrote up in significant event analyses but information as to the nature and effect of this was not forthcoming. Moderate inter-rater reliability (Spearman's Rho .65) was found between pairs of departmental raters dealing with larger numbers (20-60) of portfolios. Inter-rater reliability of marking involving GP tutors who only marked 1-3 portfolios was very low. Students rated highly their mentoring relationship with their GP teacher but found the portfolio tasks time-consuming.CONCLUSIONThe inter-rater reliability observed in this study should be viewed alongside the high validity afforded by the authenticity of the learning tasks (compared with a sample of a student's learning taken by an exam question). Validity is enhanced by the rating scale which directly connects the grade given with intended learning outcomes. The moderate inter-rater reliability may be increased if a portfolio is completed over a longer period of time and contains more component pieces of work. The questionnaire used in this study only accessed limited information about the effect of reflection on students' learning. Qualitative methods of evaluation would determine the students experience in greater depth. It would be useful to evaluate the effects of reflective learning after students have had more time to get used to this unfamiliar method of learning and to overcome any problems in understanding the task.",0,1474

To avoid reinforcing stereotypes, medical programmes and medical school curricula can incorporate efforts to promote reflection on provider attitudes, beliefs and biases.",0,1476
1477,"Gstrein, V. (2018"," ""Ideation, social construction and drug policy: A scoping review."" The International journal on drug policy 51: 75-86.","Within drug policy scholarship there is a growing body of literature applying ideational and social constructionist approaches to address the complexity of drug policy making and the apparent failure of the evidence-based policy paradigm to free the process from controversy and contestation. Ideational approaches are concerned with the roles played by ideas and beliefs in policy making, while social construction explores the way policy problems are constructed, and agendas are set and delineated by dominant frames and narratives. Interest in these approaches has developed over the last two decades, but has rapidly gained momentum over the last five years. There has been limited reflection on the state of the field, therefore it is timely to conduct a review of the literature to assess the value of these approaches, capture emerging themes and issues, and identify gaps in the literature to support future research directions. Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, a scoping review was conducted to survey the breadth of the field. Following database and hand searching, 48 studies from 1996 to 2016 were selected for inclusion in the review. A narrative synthesis was undertaken and the literature was grouped into five broad theoretical approaches: ideational policy theory, problem construction, narratives and frames (including media analysis), construction of target populations, and policy transfer and mobilities. The majority of the studies are focused on single countries and drug policy issues, with few studies undertaking comparative work or reflecting on general theoretical developments in the literature. This study found that the Arksey and O'Malley framework was effective in capturing a potentially diverse field of literature and demonstrates the importance of ideational and social constructionist approaches to drug policy scholarship. Further research is required to achieve expanded geographic coverage, test policy making models and undertake comparative work.",0,1477

Experimental eye research 87(6","Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine kinase that interacts through its COOH terminus with beta1 and beta3 integrins, which mediates a diversity of cell functions by coupling integrins and growth factors to cascades of downstream signaling events. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of ILK on development of experimental proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Cultured human RPE cell line D407 was knocked down for ILK using a small interfering RNA (siRNA). For this, cellular ILK expression was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis and immunocytochemical assay, and cytotoxicity of transfection was determined by MTT assay. Moreover, cell attachment, spreading, migration, microfilament dynamics, and cell cycling assays were performed. Furthermore, the impact of the ILK-specific siRNA on PVR was tested using a rabbit model in which PVR was induced by the injection of human RPE cells. Prevalence of PVR and retinal detachment were determined by indirect ophthalmoscopy on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-injection. The results showed that blocking the expression of ILK by siRNA significantly inhibited human RPE cell attachment, spreading, migration and proliferation. The knockdown of ILK also disturbed F-actin assembly and induced a cellular arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Though the eyes injected with ILK-specific siRNA also developed features of PVR, the severities of day 28 post-injection were significantly lower than those in the control eyes (P<0.01). We conclude that targeting of ILK with a small interfering RNA not only inhibits human RPE cell attachment, spreading, migration and proliferation in vitro, but also effectively suppresses development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy in a rabbit model. This may be a potential therapeutic usefulness in treating PVR.",0,1479

Patients with retinal vasculitis are subjected to extensive but unrewarding systemic workup. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is now commonly used to detect DNA of infective organisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study was undertaken to characterize the clinical characteristics of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis, so as to determine the clinical presentation, associated systemic features, management, and course of this form of vasculitis.METHODSThe clinical records of 13 patients seen between 1997 and 1999 with the diagnosis of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis from the aqueous or vitreous humor were reviewed. Recorded data included age, sex, race, visual acuity, anterior and posterior segment findings, and results of diagnostic evaluations. All received antituberculosis therapy with or without concomitant corticosteroids. Laser scatter photocoagulation was done in eyes with neovascularization. One eye with vitreous hemorrhage was subjected to pars plana vitrectomy.RESULTSThere were 9 (69.2%) male and 4 (30.7%) female patients with a median age of 20 years. The disease was bilateral in seven. The most consistent finding was the presence of vitritis in all the eyes followed by vitreous snowball opacities in 17 eyes (89.4%), neovascularization in 11 eyes (57.8%), retinal hemorrhages in 10 eyes (52.6%), neuroretinitis in 10 eyes (52.6%), focal choroiditis in 9 eyes (47.3%), vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage in 5 eyes (26.3%), and serous retinal detachment in 3 eyes (15.7%).

With the increasing availability of refined surgical techniques as well as the early diagnosis of disease because of screening, one would predict that the prevalence of this condition is decreasing and the visual outcome is improving.AIMTo study the prevalence and visual outcome following vitrectomy for complications of diabetic retinopathy.MATERIALS AND METHODSThis study identified the patients who underwent vitrectomy from January 2007 to December 2009 because of diabetes-related complications in South East London. Data collected included baseline demographics, best-corrected visual acuity, indication for the vitrectomy, complication, outcome, and duration of follow-up.RESULTSThe prevalence of people requiring vitrectomy who are registered in the diabetes register of this region was 2 per 1000 people with diabetes. Vitrectomy was required in 185 eyes of 158 patients during this period. These included 83 Caucasians, 51 Afro-Caribbeans, 17 South Asians, and 7 from other ethnic groups. There were 58 patients with type I diabetes and 100 with type II, with a mean duration of diabetes of 23 and 16.5 years, respectively. The reason for vitrectomy included tractional retinal detachment (TRD) in 109 eyes, non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage (NCVH) in 68 eyes, and other causes in 8 eyes. In all, 50% of the eyes with TRD and NCVH, and 87% of the eyes with NCVH improved by at least three ETDRS lines at 12 months. Poor predictors of visual success included longer duration of diabetes (OR: 0.69), use of insulin (OR: 0.04), presence of ischaemic heart disease (OR: 0.04), delay in surgery (OR: 0.59), and the failure to attend clinic appointments (OR: 0.58). Preoperative use of intravitreal bevacizumab in eyes with TRD undergoing vitrectomy showed a marginal beneficial effect on co-existent maculopathy (P=0.08) and required less laser intervention post procedure, but did not affect the number of episodes of late-onset vitreous haemorrhage post vitrectomy (P=0.81).CONCLUSIONVisual outcome has improved significantly in eyes with complications due to diabetic retinopathy compared with the previously reported Diabetic Vitrectomy Study.",0,1481

The combined findings from theory and experiment are consistent with formation of ""interior"" complexes in which the Yb atom is embedded within a shell of NH3 molecules, rather than sitting on the surface of an (NH3)n cluster. The calculations also suggest that Yb can accommodate up to eight NH3 molecules in its first solvation shell before steric repulsion makes occupancy of the second solvation shell more favourable energetically. The experimental ionization data are consistent with this prediction, as demonstrated by below-trend adiabatic ionization energies for the n=9 and 10 complexes.

Sociol Health Illn 40(5","This article reports an ethnographic study of the handover routines in Germany's first dementia village, with a central focus on how care is balanced between domestic intimacy and institutional detachment. The term 'professionalised intimacy' is used for the vivid interplay between comfort and intimacy that renders the interaction between care workers and residents far more complex than previous theories have articulated. Because of the intimacy involved in community building, however, the promise of personalised care must clash with the bureaucratic structures of an official institution, potentially depriving the care workers of their public, respected identity in the process. The study further suggests that most care workers, in fact, support this division between domestic intimacy and institutional detachment. Even if they subscribe to a dementia village's philosophy of personalised care, their medical training and enculturation has endowed them with a habitus compatible with the modern health profession, with incentives on achieving quantifiable health goals. The dementia village is thus illustrated as a pioneering health care experiment that negotiates rivalling discourses of intimacy, professionalisation, and medicalisation.",0,1485

Australian Social Work.","Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is emerging in the published literature as an important aspect of postdisaster recovery. Despite these research insights into the positive transformations that people experience, PTG has not been formally operationalised in postdisaster psychosocial recovery efforts. This paper presents findings from a mixed methods study of people affected by the 2009 Victorian 'Black Saturday' bushfires. Data from in-depth interviews and the PTG Inventory-Short Form (PTGI-SF) with 20 participants gathered five years after the fires were used to gain new insights into perceptions of postdisaster growth. Higher levels of growth were reported by those who were personally involved. Thematic findings were consistent with most of the PTGI-SF factors. Additionally, growth through connections, the acquisition of new skills, and creative engagement were identified as core growth processes. These processes support conceptualising postdisaster PTG in broader relational terms, rather than more typically psychological ones, which may then inform effective interventions.IMPLICATIONS Many people report posttraumatic growth as part of their disaster recovery experiences. Growth experiences are diverse, and include the acquisition of new skills and connections as well as intrapsychic changes.Social workers can support growth by understanding the complex interaction with trauma experiences.Growth experiences may vary depending upon people’s personal and professional disaster involvements.

The secondary objectives were to summarize any data on economic measures and quality of life.SEARCH METHODSWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).

We last searched the electronic databases on 13 January 2015.SELECTION CRITERIAWe included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle (with or without vitrectomy) for eyes with RRD.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISAfter screening for eligibility, two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. We followed systematic review standards as set forth by The Cochrane Collaboration.MAIN RESULTSWe included two randomized controlled trials (218 eyes of 216 participants) comparing the effectiveness of pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle for eyes with RRD. We identified no studies investigating the comparison of pneumatic retinopexy versus a combination treatment of scleral buckle and vitrectomy. Of the two included studies, one was a small study with 20 participants enrolled in Ireland and followed for an average of 16 months. The second study was larger with 196 participants (198 eyes) enrolled in the United States and followed for at least 6 months. Cautious interpretation of the results is warranted, since we graded the evidence as low to moderate quality due to insufficient reporting of study methods and imprecision and inconsistency among study results.Both studies showed fewer eyes achieving retinal reattachment in the pneumatic retinopexy group compared with the scleral buckle group by six-months follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.02, 218 eyes); however, we are uncertain as to whether the intervention has an important effect on reattachment because the results are imprecise. Eyes in the pneumatic retinopexy group also were more likely to have had a recurrence of retinal detachment by six-months follow-up (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.24, 218 eyes); however, we are uncertain as to whether the intervention has an important effect on recurrence because the lower CI equals no difference. Neither study reported mean change in visual acuity, quality of life data, or economic measures. Differences between the pneumatic retinopexy group and scleral buckle group were uncertain due to small numbers of events with respect to operative ocular adverse events (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.42, 218 eyes), development of cataract (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.54, 198 eyes), glaucoma (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.91, 198 eyes), macular pucker (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.67, 198 eyes), and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.96, 218 eyes). Fewer eyes in the pneumatic retinopexy group compared with the scleral buckle group experienced choroidal detachment (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.57, 198 eyes) or myopic shift equal to r greater than 1 diopter spherical equivalent (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.13, 198 eyes).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSThe evidence suggests that pneumatic retinopexy may result in lower rates of reattachment and higher rates of recurrence than scleral buckle for eyes with RRD, but does not rule out no difference between procedures. The relative safety of the procedures is uncertain and the relative effects of these procedures in terms of other patient-important outcomes, such as visual acuity and quality of life, is unknown. Due to the limited information available between pneumatic retinopexy and scleral buckle procedures, future research addressing these evidence gaps are warranted.",0,1493

However, to our knowledge there are no studies that assess the influence of very early nursing attachments on the professional development and identity construction of medical students. Working as an assistant nurse while training to be a doctor may offer valuable learning experiences, but may also present the student with difficulties with respect to identity and identification issues. The aim of the present study was to describe first-year medical students' perceptions of nurses, doctors and their own future roles as doctors before and after a nursing attachment. Methods: A questionnaire containing open questions concerning students' perceptions of nurses, doctors and their own future roles as doctors was administered to all Year 1 medical students (n = 347) before and directly after a 4-week nursing attachment in hospitals and nursing homes. We carried out two confirmatory focus group interviews. We analysed the data using qualitative and quantitative content analyses. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 316 students (response rate 91%). Before starting the attachment students regarded nurses as empathic, communicative and responsible. After the attachment students reported nurses had more competencies and responsibilities than they had expected. Students' views of doctors were ambivalent. Before and after the attachment, doctors were seen as interested and reliable, but also as arrogant, detached and insensible. However, students maintained positive views of their own future roles as doctors. Students' perceptions were influenced by age, gender and place of attachment. Conclusions: An early nursing attachment engenders more respect for the nursing profession. The ambivalent view of doctors needs to be explored further in relation to students' professional development.

Depression and Anxiety.","BACKGROUNDDepression is common, particularly among women of childbearing age, and can have far-reaching negative consequences if untreated. Efficacious treatments are available, but little is known about how women make depression treatment decisions during pregnancy. The purpose of this narrative review is to interpretively synthesize literature on women's decision making (DM) regarding antidepressant use during pregnancy.METHODSThe databases PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched between May 2015 and August 2017 for peer-reviewed, English-language papers using terms such as ""depression,"" ""pregnancy,"" and ""DM."" The literature matrix abstraction method was used to systematically abstract data from full articles that met criteria for inclusion.RESULTSOf the articles abstracted (N = 10), half did not cite a DM theory on which the work was based. Key aspects of DM for this population were need for information and decision support, desire for active participation in DM, reflection on beliefs and values, evaluation of treatment option sequelae, and societal expectations. Treatment DM for depression during pregnancy is particularly impacted by the stigma associated with depression and societal expectations of pregnant women related to medication use during pregnancy. These findings, however, were based on studies of predominantly Caucasian and well-educated women.CONCLUSIONSWomen require a nonjudgmental environment, in which shared DM feels safe, to foster positive DM experiences and outcomes. Future research is needed to define how to best support women to make depression treatment decisions in pregnancy, with particular attention to DM in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.",0,1499

Optics express 26(3","Accurate quantitative temperature measurements are difficult to achieve using focal-plane array sensors. This is due to reflections inside the instrument and the difficulty of calibrating a matrix of pixels as identical radiation thermometers. Size-of-source effect (SSE), which is the dependence of an infrared temperature measurement on the area surrounding the target area, is a major contributor to this problem and cannot be reduced using glare stops. Measurements are affected by power received from outside the field-of-view (FOV), leading to increased measurement uncertainty. In this work, we present a micromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror based scanning thermal imaging camera with reduced measurement uncertainty compared to focal-plane array based systems. We demonstrate our flexible imaging approach using a Si avalanche photodiode (APD), which utilises high internal gain to enable the measurement of lower target temperatures with an effective wavelength of 1 µm and compare results with a Si photodiode. We compare measurements from our APD thermal imaging instrument against a commercial bolometer based focal-plane array camera. Our scanning approach results in a reduction in SSE related temperature error by 66 °C for the measurement of a spatially uniform 800 °C target when the target aperture diameter is increased from 10 to 20 mm. We also find that our APD instrument is capable of measuring target temperatures below 700 °C, over these near infrared wavelengths, with D* related measurement uncertainty of ± 0.5 °C.",0,1500

Behav Sleep Med 16(5","BACKGROUND: African Americans experience more problematic and disordered sleep than White Americans. Racial discrimination has been implicated in this disparity. However, the mechanisms by which discrimination disrupts sleep are unclear. It has been theorized that Perseverative Cognition (PC), characterized by recurrent patterns of reflective (i.e., rumination) and anticipatory (i.e., worry) negative thinking about personally relevant stressors, may reflect the functional mechanism linking discrimination to sleep. The present study is the first to empirically examine the dual components of PC as a candidate functional mechanism in the association between racial discrimination and subjective sleep quality. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight self-identified African American college students (55.9% female; Mage = 20.18, SD = 2.93) were recruited at a large predominantly white public university in the Midwest. METHODS: The participants completed the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire (PEDQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS). RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and social class, results revealed a significant indirect effect of racial discrimination (RD) on subjective sleep quality through rumination, 95% CI [.008, .125], but not worry. RD was positively associated with rumination, b =.50, SE =.16, p = .003, and rumination, in turn, was positively associated with poorer sleep quality, b = .09, SE = .04, p = .012. CONCLUSIONS: As both RD and poor sleep quality have been directly linked to heart disease, diabetes, depression, and a number of other maladies, our findings suggest that RD, sleep, and coping strategies (e.g., rumination) employed to manage RD experiences may be important targets for addressing racial disparities in health.",0,1501

(2013"," ""Goethe's anxieties, depressive episodes and (self-","BACKGROUNDIn psychiatry and psychotherapy, abstract scientific principles need to be exemplified by narrative case reports to gain practical precision. Goethe was one of the most creative writers, productive scientists, and effective statesmen that ever lived. His descriptions of feelings, emotions, and mental states related to anxieties, depressive episodes, dysthymia, and creativity are unique in their phenomenological precision and richness. His life and work can thus serve as an excellent example enhancing our understanding of the relationship between anxiety, depression and creativity. Furthermore, he described (self-)therapeutic strategies that reinforce and refine modern views.METHODSGoethe's self-assessments in his works and letters, and the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of current psychiatric classification. His therapeutic techniques and recommendations are compared with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and existential psychotherapy to amplify modern concepts of psychotherapy.RESULTSFrom a scientific perspective, several distinctive depressive episodes can be diagnosed in Goethe's life. They were characterized by extended depressive moods, lack of drive, and loss of interest and self-esteem combined with social retreat. Goethe displayed diffuse and phobic anxieties as well as dysthymia. His (self-)therapeutic strategies were: (a) the systematic use of helping alliances, (b) behavioral techniques, (c) cognitive reflection on meanings and beliefs, (d) psychodynamic and psychoanalytic remembering, repeating, and working through, and (e) existential striving for self-actualization, social commitment, meaning, and creativity.CONCLUSIONSIn Goethe's life, creative incubation, illumination, and elaboration appear to have been associated with psychic instability and dysthymia, sometimes with depressive episodes in a clinical sense. On the one hand, his creative work was triggered by anxieties, dysthymia, and depressive moods. On the other hand, his creativity helped him to cope with psychic disorders and suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, Goethe described psychotherapeutic strategies that resemble modern techniques. He integrated relational, behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic, and existential techniques and attitudes. These modern psychotherapeutic approaches can be exemplified and enhanced by reflecting upon the (self-)therapeutic efforts of one of the most creative persons that have ever lived. Hermeneutics as the art of communication and understanding derived from Goethe's (self-)therapy and creative works can serve as a meta-theoretical framework for the integration of different psychotherapeutic approaches.",0,1502

Advances in simulation (London, England","In this paper, we report on a series of placements for clinical exercise physiology students in a simulation-based education environment with older, independent adults. The purpose of these placement opportunities was to help prepare students to work confidently and competently with older adults in primary healthcare settings. The effectiveness of these placements was measured through semi-structured interviews with the students, their supervisors and the volunteer patients, and also by analysing the content of the students' written reflection assignments. A combination of directed content analysis, informed by the research objectives and imposed upon the data, and conventional content analysis, in which codes were developed from themes emerging from the data, was adopted. Coding was based on units of meaning. Overall, the placement aims were met. Students reported increased confidence in communicating with older adults and in using the tools of their trade. This innovative simulation-based education experience helped students gain an understanding of their developing professional identities. However, the data show that some students still failed to recognise the value and importance of communication when working with older adults. The older adults reported that they enjoyed interacting with the students and believed that they had helped the students gain a positive impression of the cognitive and physical abilities of older adults. These older adults had also gained insight into the benefits of exercise physiology in terms of their own wellbeing. This paper demonstrates the benefits of engaging community support in developing healthcare workers and provides guidelines for replication of these innovative simulation-based education experiences. The paper is limited to reporting the social and community engagement benefits for older adults and the learning opportunities for the clinical exercise physiology students. Further research is needed to demonstrate the health gains for older adults who participate in such programmes.",0,1503

It was designed as a longitudinal self-directed structured record of student learning events, with reflection on these for personal and professional development, and actions planned or taken for learning.As incentive was needed to encourage student engagement, an innovative Clinical Log station was introduced in the OSCE, an assessment format with established acceptance at the School. This study questions: How does an OSCE Clinical Log station influence Log use by students?METHODSThe Log station was introduced into the formative, and subsequent summative, OSCEs with careful attention to student and assessor training, marking rubrics and the standard setting procedure. The scoring process sought evidence of educational use of the log, and an ability to present and reflect on key learning issues in a concise and coherent manner.RESULTSAnalysis of the first cohort's Log use over the four-year course (quantified as number of patient visits entered by all students) revealed limited initial use. Usage was stimulated after introduction of the Log station early in third year, with some improvement during the subsequent year-long integrated community-based clerkship. Student reflection, quantified by the mean number of characters in the 'reflection' fields per entry, peaked just prior to the final OSCE (mid-Year 4). Following this, very few students continued to enter and reflect on clinical experience using the Log.CONCLUSIONWhile the current study suggested that we can't assume students will self-reflect unless such an activity is included in an assessment, ongoing work has focused on building learner and faculty confidence in the value of self-reflection as part of being a competent physician.",0,1506

Psychoneuroendocrinology 38(10","The influence of naturally occurring emotional and cognitive experiences on hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal axis (HPAA) activity is still underinvestigated, particularly in clinical populations. The present study examined effects of mood and rumination on cortisol levels in daily life in remitted depressed patients with recurrent episodes or a chronic precourse (n = 31) and healthy controls (n = 32). Ambulatory assessment of subjective variables (valence, calmness, energetic-arousal, ruminative self-focus), daily stressors, and saliva cortisol samples was performed five times a day on two consecutive workdays, whereby cortisol was collected 20 min after the subjective assessments. In addition, depressive symptoms and trait rumination (brooding, reflection) were measured retrospectively. Multilevel models revealed that remitted depressed patients showed lower cortisol activity compared to healthy controls. Depressive symptoms and trait rumination did not predict HPAA activity, whereas, by controlling for daily stressors, higher daily means of ruminative self-focus and lower daily means of valence, energetic arousal and calmness were associated with higher daily cortisol levels. Separate analyses per group revealed that mean daily ruminative self-focus predicted higher cortisol in both samples. In contrast, lower daily means of calmness, but also of valence and energetic arousal, were significantly linked to higher cortisol output only in healthy controls, but not in the patient sample. These findings indicate that naturally occurring rumination and low mood are associated with increased activation of the HPAA in daily life. Moreover, our data revealed a potentially reduced mood—cortisol coupling in remitted recurrent depression, possibly indicating that during the course of recurrent depression HPAA activation might become less responsive toward subtle emotional experiences in natural contexts.

Mindfulness 8(4","As mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) becomes an increasingly mainstream approach for recurrent depression, there is a growing need for practitioners who are able to teach MBCT. The requirements for being competent as a mindfulness-based teacher include personal meditation practice and at least a year of additional professional training. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between MBCT teacher competence and several key dimensions of MBCT treatment outcomes. Patients with recurrent depression in remission (N = 241) participated in a multi-centre trial of MBCT, provided by 15 teachers. Teacher competence was assessed using the Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI:TAC) based on two to four randomly selected video-recorded sessions of each of the 15 teachers, evaluated by 16 trained assessors. Results showed that teacher competence was not significantly associated with adherence (number of MBCT sessions attended), possible mechanisms of change (rumination, cognitive reactivity, mindfulness, and self-compassion), or key outcomes (depressive symptoms at post treatment and depressive relapse/recurrence during the 15-month follow-up). Thus, findings from the current study indicate no robust effects of teacher competence, as measured by the MBI:TAC, on possible mediators and outcome variables in MBCT for recurrent depression. Possible explanations are the standardized delivery of MBCT, the strong emphasis on self-reliance within the MBCT learning process, the importance of participant-related factors, the difficulties in assessing teacher competence, the absence of main treatment effects in terms of reducing depressive symptoms, and the relatively small selection of videotapes. Further work is required to systematically investigate these explanations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1508

For this study, data was collected at 2 time points, over a 3-month period, from a sample of 393 French supervisors working in the health care setting. Results from a cross-lagged model based on structural equation modeling indicated that workload positively predicted managers’ tendency to work excessively, but it was not significantly related to their tendency to work compulsively. In turn, working excessively had positive effects on supervisors’ work-family conflict and lack of psychological detachment. Working compulsively did not significantly predict either of these outcomes over time. Overall, these findings shed light on the mechanisms involved in the longitudinal relationship between managers’ work experience and their functioning outside the job. More specifically, this study goes beyond previous research by emphasizing that the 2 dimensions of workaholism have differential antecedents and outcomes over time.

Behavioural Brain Research 333: 135-141.","Increased resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the default mode network (DMN) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) is consistently reported in adults and youth with psychopathologies related to affect dysregulation (e.g. depression, posttraumatic stress disorder). This pattern of increased rsFC is thought to underlie ruminative thought patterns through integration of negative affect (via sgACC) into self-referential operations supported by the DMN. Neurobiological studies in adults show that behavioral activation system (BAS) sensitivity is a potential protective factor against the development of psychopathology, particularly in the context of stress and trauma exposure. However, whether BAS sensitivity is associated with variation in DMN-sgACC stress-vulnerability circuitry in youth, particularly those at risk for affect dysregulation, has not yet been studied. This association was tested in a sample of ninety-eight children and adolescents (ages 6–17) at high sociodemographic risk for psychopathology (i.e., urban, lower income, high frequency of violence and abuse exposure). Participants underwent a six-minute resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Using a targeted, small-volume corrected approach, we found that youth with higher BAS sensitivity demonstrated lower DMN-sgACC rsFC, suggesting a potential link between the purported protective effects of BAS sensitivity and stress-vulnerability circuitry. This work suggests that interventions that augment BAS sensitivity, such as behavioral activation therapy, may protect against the development of stress-related psychopathology by modifying a critical rumination circuitry in the brain. Such interventions may be especially important for bolstering resiliency in at-risk urban youth, who are disproportionately burdened by early stress and associated psychopathology.

However, whether there is a common component in the adaptive aspects of ruminative or distractive response styles has not been examined sufficiently. Adaptiveness of ruminative or distractive response styles is considered to be associated with decentering; thus, we investigated the indirect effects of four types of the response style (adaptive/maladaptive aspects of each response style) on depression through decentering. In this study, 241 Japanese undergraduate students (75 men and 166 women) were assessed using the Response Style Scale, the Japanese Version of Experience Questionnaire, and the Japanese Version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Mediation analyses revealed that decentering fully mediated the effects of adaptive aspects of ruminative and distractive response styles on depression whereas it partially mediated the effects of maladaptive aspects of response styles. These results indicate that the adaptiveness of response styles is influenced by decentering, and it particularly works in the adaptive aspects of ruminative/distractive response styles as a common element. Thus, a possibility is suggested that cultivating decentered perspective is effective in reducing maladaptive aspects of both response styles to negative moods or objects.

Effective collaboration should require health professions to consider how the use of language is reflective of systemic power and challenge that discourse as a means of developing a new, shared language for interprofessional collaboration (IPC). Some interprofessional conflicts may actually be due to issues related to how power is distributed within teams. The power implicit in health professional discourses and language, however, may create conflicts and tensions within interprofessional teams. Reflecting on the use of language and discourse within health professions may be an important means to explicitly critique the implicit use of power. Health professionals should, however, change the way in which they define and use power. Specifically, health professionals must shift the use from power-over to power-with. Power-over refers to traditional, hierarchical models characterized by well-defined team structures and explicit use of non-negotiable authority and control.

A new area of research interest has been the role of emerging educational technologies in PBL. Although this field is growing, no systematic reviews of studies of the usage and effects of educational technologies in PBL in health sciences education have been conducted to date.OBJECTIVEThe aim of this paper is to review new and emerging educational technologies in problem-based curricula, with a specific focus on 3 cognate clinical disciplines: medicine, dentistry, and speech and hearing sciences. Analysis of the studies reviewed focused on the effects of educational technologies in PBL contexts while addressing the particular issue of scaffolding of student learning.METHODSA comprehensive computerized database search of full-text articles published in English from 1996 to 2014 was carried out using 3 databases: ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Eligibility criteria for selection of studies for review were also determined in light of the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) guidelines. The population was limited to postsecondary education, specifically in dentistry, medicine, and speech and hearing sciences, in which PBL was the key educational pedagogy and curriculum design. Three types of educational technologies were identified as interventions used to support student inquiry: learning software and digital learning objects; interactive whiteboards (IWBs) and plasma screens; and learning management systems (LMSs).RESULTSOf 470 studies, 28 were selected for analysis. Most studies examined the effects of learning software and digital learning objects (n=20) with integration of IWB (n=5) and LMS (n=3) for PBL receiving relatively less attention. The educational technologies examined in these studies were seen as potentially fit for problem-based health sciences education. Positive outcomes for student learning included providing rich, authentic problems and/or case contexts for learning; supporting student development of medical expertise through the accessing and structuring of expert knowledge and skills; making disciplinary thinking and strategies explicit; providing a platform to elicit articulation, collaboration, and reflection; and reducing perceived cognitive load. Limitations included cumbersome scenarios, infrastructure requirements, and the need for staff and student support in light of the technological demands of new affordances.CONCLUSIONSThis literature review demonstrates the generally positive effect of educational technologies in PBL. Further research into the various applications of educational technology in PBL curricula is needed to fully realize its potential to enhance problem-based approaches in health sciences education.",0,1520

Investigative ophthalmology & visual science 45(1","PURPOSEHepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates barrier function of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether overexpression of HGF in the RPE induces retinal detachment (RD).METHODSE1/E3-deleted adenoviral vectors encoding HGF (Ad CMV.HGF), green fluorescent protein (Ad CMV.GFP), or connective tissue growth factor (AdCMV.CTGF) were injected subretinally in adult pigmented rabbits (5 x 10(4) plaque-forming units [pfu]/eye). Animals were observed for up to 28 days with fundus photography. HGF expression in the retina and vitreous was determined using immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. Histopathologic examinations were performed with light and electron microscopy.RESULTSControl eyes injected with AdCMV.GFP showed GFP expression almost exclusively in the RPE monolayer. Eyes injected with AdCMV.HGF showed strong HGF immunopositivity in RPE cells at the injection site. Elevated HGF levels were found in the vitreous peaking at postinjection day 7, diminishing to baseline by postinjection day 28. Eyes injected with AdCMV.HGF developed chronic RD and chronic inflammation in the choroid within the time frame of HGF expression. Groups of proliferating RPE cells were seen in the subretinal space in the region of the RD, and in some cases multilayered cellular membranes developed. No RD and minimal morphologic changes were seen in the eyes injected with AdCMV.GFP or AdCMV.CTGF.CONCLUSIONSOverexpression of HGF in RPE induces chronic, serous RD with subretinal proliferation of RPE. This work provides insight into the pathogenesis of RD and suggests that HGF should be further investigated as a target for therapeutic intervention in RD.",0,1521

Experimental eye research 81(5","The purpose of this work was to evaluate the ability of 80 MHz ultrasonography to differentiate intra-retinal layers and quantitatively assess photoreceptor dystrophy in small animal models. Four groups of 10 RCS rats each (five dystrophic and five controls) were explored at 25, 35, 45 and 55 days post-natal (PN). A series of retina cross-sections were obtained ex vivo from outside intact eyes using an 80 MHz three-dimensional ultrasound backscatter microscope (20-microm-axial resolution). Ultrasound features of normal retina were correlated to those of corresponding histology and thickness measurements of photoreceptor segment and nuclear layers were performed on all groups. To show the ability of 80 MHz ultrasonography to distinguish the retinal degeneration in vivo, one RCS rat was explored at 25 and 55 days post-natal. Ultrasound image of normal retina displayed four distinct layers marked by reflections at neurites/nuclei interfaces and permitted to differentiate the photoreceptor segment and nuclear layers. The backscatter level from the retina was shown to be related to the size, density and organization of the intra-layer structure. Ultrasound thickness measurements highly correlated with histologic measurements. A thinning (p<0.05) of outer nuclear layer (ONL) was detected over time for controls and was thought to be assigned to retina maturation. Retinal degeneration started at PN35 and resulted in a more pronounced ONL thinning (p<0.05) over time. ONL degeneration was accompanied by segment layer thickening (p<0.05) at PN35 and thinning thereafter. These changes may indicate accumulation of outer segment debris at PN35 then progressive destruction. In vivo images of rat intra-retinal structure showed the ability of the method to distinguish the photoreceptor layer changes. Our results indicate that 80 MHz ultrasonography reveals intra-retinal layers and is sensitive to age and degenerative changes of photoreceptors. This technique has great potential to follow-up retinal dystrophy and therapeutic effects in vivo.",0,1522

Women were administered an epidemiologic survey to determine sexual risk behaviour and they provided biological samples to test for BV and STDs. The prevalence of BV was high (27%) and was significantly associated with having a bacterial STD or trichomoniasis. Age, marital status, and a history of sex work, but not of sexual experience, frequency of intercourse, and unprotected intercourse, were associated with BV. As BV may be a marker for STDs, screening for STDs should be performed in individuals with BV to promote early detection and treatment of co-infecting sexually transmitted pathogens.

In 2007, the report ‘Aiming High for Young People’ outlined policies intended to contribute to the achievement of associated goals. The Youth Sector Development Fund (YSDF) provided Civil Sector Organisations (CSOs) with the means to put the policies into practice and also aimed to build organisational capacity. Using data gathered for the evaluation of one organisation's YSDF-financed programme of detached work on housing estates in Yorkshire, this article explores some of the tensions between the traditional youth work values of voluntary engagement, informal education and association and the demand for quick results linked to a particular short-term funding stream. The potential for longer-term impacts was undermined as YSDF's approach to ensuring sustainability focused on funding diversification rather than embedding the work in local communities. The article concludes that ongoing input rather than a short injection of funding is needed to generate effective long-term impacts on communities.

Journal of Interprofessional Care 15(1","Health and welfare practitioners in the United Kingdom have experienced and continue to experience considerable turbulence as services and occupational boundaries undergo restructuring. To a significant extent such turbulence is driven by policies that promote interprofessional agendas. This paper reports on an evaluation of a higher education programme that adopted a social policy approach to the analysis of interprofessional working. The retrospective views were sought of nursing, midwifery, social work and community and youth work post-qualifying students with use of semi-structured questionnaires and focus groups. Although difficulties were encountered with the political science focus to the programme, overall the participants very positively evaluated the opportunity to engage in policy analysis in a shared learning environment. Given the highly politicised, complex and shifting environment of interprofessional working, it is suggested that the study lends support to the argument that 'policy acumen' is a central skill for contemporary health and welfare practitioners. The paper, therefore, starts to explore issues of particular relevance for educationalists involved in developing frameworks for interprofessional programmes particularly in higher education.",0,1526

BMC medical education 16: 83.","BACKGROUNDThere is little research on large-scale complex health care simulations designed to facilitate student learning of non-technical skills in a team-working environment. We evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a novel natural disaster simulation that enabled medical students to demonstrate their achievement of the non-technical skills of collaboration, negotiation and communication.METHODSIn a mixed methods approach, survey data were available from 117 students and a thematic analysis undertaken of both student qualitative comments and tutor observer participation data.RESULTSNinety three per cent of students found the activity engaging for their learning. Three themes emerged from the qualitative data: the impact of fidelity on student learning, reflexivity on the importance of non-technical skills in clinical care, and opportunities for collaborative teamwork. Physical fidelity was sufficient for good levels of student engagement, as was sociological fidelity. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the simulation in allowing students to reflect upon and evidence their acquisition of skills in collaboration, negotiation and communication, as well as situational awareness and attending to their emotions. Students readily identified emerging learning opportunities though critical reflection. The scenarios challenged students to work together collaboratively to solve clinical problems, using a range of resources including interacting with clinical experts.CONCLUSIONSA large class teaching activity, framed as a simulation of a natural disaster is an acceptable and effective activity for medical students to develop the non-technical skills of collaboration, negotiation and communication, which are essential to team working. The design could be of value in medical schools in disaster prone areas, including within low resource countries, and as a feasible intervention for learning the non-technical skills that are needed for patient safety.",0,1527

Globalization and health 14(1","BACKGROUNDGlobal Health is an inherently interdisciplinary field but overseas training in global health, particularly among health science institutions, has been an 'individual' or 'individual discipline' experience. Team-based training is an approach to global health education which is increasing in popularity; research on team-training demonstrates that teams are more productive than individuals. In 2015, the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health (CGH) developed the Global Established Multidisciplinary Sites (GEMS) program, an interdisciplinary training program which was designed to establish a new norm in global health training by bringing interdisciplinary teams of faculty and students together to identify and solve complex global health challenges. This research aims to evaluate the program's first year and contribute to the literature on interdisciplinary team training. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with students, faculty, and local collaborators from 3 GEMS project sites. Findings were analyzed for themes through a framework approach.RESULTSThe program exposed students, faculty, and collaborators to a wide range of disciplines in global health. Students' desire to learn how other disciplines contribute to global health solutions was an important motivator for joining GEMS; many participants including faculty and collaborators valued exposure to multiple disciplines. Mentorship and communication were a challenge across all teams in part due to members having distinct ""disciplinary languages"". Balancing disciplinary representation on teams and establishing work plans were also key challenges.CONCLUSIONSBased on the data the CGH provides four recommendations for institutions developing global health interdisciplinary teams to optimize team functioning and address challenges in mentorship, language, and roles: 1) address interdisciplinary communication early, 2) develop work plans during group formation, 3) meet as a team prior to travel, and 4) establish regular check ins. This article provides first-hand reflections on interdisciplinary team experiences in a global context and provides a pathway for the development of innovative strategies in global health training.",0,1529

NeuroRx : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics 3(1","How does a small molecule blocking a few receptors change a patients' passionately held paranoid belief that the FBI is out to get him? To address this central puzzle of antipsychotic action, we review a framework linking dopamine neurochemistry to psychosis, and then link this framework to the mechanism of action of antipsychotics. Normal dopamine transmission has a role in predicting novel rewards and in marking and responding to motivationally salient stimuli. Abnormal dopamine transmission alters these processes and results in an aberrant sense of novelty and inappropriate assignment of salience leading to the experience of psychosis. Antipsychotics improve psychosis by diminishing this abnormal transmission by blocking the dopamine D2/3 receptor (not D1 or D4), and although several brain regions may be involved, it is suggested that the ventral striatal regions (analog of the nucleus accumbens in animals) may have a particularly critical role. Contrary to popular belief, the antipsychotic effect is not delayed in its onset, but starts within the first few days. There is more improvement in the first 2 weeks, than in any subsequent 2-week period thereafter. However, a simple organic molecule cannot target the complex phenomenology of the individual psychotic experience. Antipsychotics diminish dopamine transmission and thereby dampen the salience of the pre-occupying symptoms. Therefore, in the initial stage of an antipsychotic response, the patients experience a detachment from symptoms, a relegation of the delusions and hallucinations to the back of their minds, rather than a complete erasure of the symptoms. Only with time, and only in some, via the mediation of new learning and plasticity, is there a complete resolution of symptoms. The implications of these findings for clinical care, animal models, future target discovery and drug development are discussed.",0,1530

The goals of the study included: (1) to investigate the barriers to effective end-of-life care for HIV patients; and (2) to examine physicians' experiences of role hindrance and frustration in caring for dying patients in the era of HAART. Qualitative, open-ended interviews were conducted with 16 physicians. Physicians identified two core, prescriptive myths shaping their care for patients with HIV. The 'Good Doctor Myth' where the role of the physician is defined as technical curer and the Good Death Myth' where the role of the physician is defined as that of comforter and supporter in the dying process. First, late-stage patients refused to adhere to treatment and were thus dying 'unnecessarily.' Second, patients often refused to acknowledge, accept, or plan for the end of life and as a result died painful, chaotic deaths. These realities presented intense psychological and practical challenges for providers. Less successful adaptation could result in detachment or anger. Working with dying HIV patients in the post-HAART era of efficacious treatment challenges physician's cherished roles and values. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1531

Technol Health Care 26(3","This study was aimed at investigating the role of IVI angle on the induced stresses and deformations among the components of the eye. Thereafter, the most optimal angle of IVI to minimize the complications of post IVI at the injection site on a basis of the computed stresses via a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) computational model was proposed. IntraVitreal Injection (IVI) is broadly employed as a principal treatment of vascular vitro-retinal diseases. So far, there have been reports regarding the complications of post IVI and determine them as severe uveitis, tractional retinal detachment, IntraOcular Pressure (IOP) elevation as well as ocular haemorrhage. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to reduce the subsequent ocular tissue damage and patient symptoms in the injection site. Seven different IVI angles were simulated, including 0 composite function, 15 composite function, 30 composite function, 45 composite function, 60 composite function, 75 composite function, and 90 composite function, through the Finite Element (FE) code; and the term, 'post IVI complication' or 'injury', in the results was interpreted as the level of maximal principal stress in the eye components. The results revealed the lowest amount of stresses at the angle of 45 composite function in respect to the horizontal line (acute to the surface of the sclera) for the lens, iris, vitreous body, aqueous body, ciliary body, sclera, retina, and choroid. The cornea illustrated the same amount of stress at the angles of 45 composite function, 60 composite function, 75 composite function, and 90 composite function with the highest one at the IVI angle of 30 composite function. The lowest and the highest stresses among the eye components regardless of IVI angle were observed in the choroid and retina/sclera, respectively, which imply the importance of the IVI angle on the stresses of these eye components. The findings of the contemporary research revealed that the IVI angle of 45 composite function would trigger less post IVI complications and, as a result, a more effective surgery outcome compared to the other angles, i.e., 0 composite function, 15 composite function, 30 composite function, 60 composite function, 75 composite function, and 90 composite function.",0,1532

Similar visual outcomes are associated with different anti-VEGF treatments. Higher anti-VEGF doses may improve anatomical response, without correlation with vision improvement. Fibrovascular PEDs may be difficult to treat, but even these eyes can gain vision with anti-VEGF therapy. A retinal pigment epithelial tear may develop in 15% to 20% of eyes with PEDs after anti-VEGF therapy, especially in PEDs greater than 500 µm to 600 µm in height; however, vision may stabilize with continued therapy. Atrophy may complicate eyes with PED and nAMD after anti-VEGF therapy, especially in association with complete PED resolution.CONCLUSIONAvailable literature suggests that anti-VEGF therapy is safe and efficacious for PED and nAMD. Treatment should focus on vision gains rather than PED resolution because there is no apparent correlation between anatomical and functional improvement in most eyes with PED and nAMD.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Visual acuity (VA), fundus photo, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were reviewed using the medical records. For statistical analysis, VA measured with a Landolt chart was converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). To investigate the pathogenesis of ERM, tryptase activity in vitreous, which plays a role in tissue fibrosis and remodeling, was measured in patients that underwent a vitrectomy for ERM, macular hole, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).RESULTSERM was observed in 604 patients and spontaneous release of the ERM was observed in 13 patients with 14 eyes (four males and nine females, aged 33-78 years). Among the 14 eyes, mean VA did not change significantly through the release of the ERMs (0.17±0.18 before and 0.24±0.40 after release, P=0.544). Nine eyes showed posterior vitreous detachment or vitreomacular traction on OCT images and five eyes did not. ERM was released in five eyes with no accompanying vitreous traction by OCT during watchful waiting and seems to have peeled off by itself by contracting and rolling from the inferior side. Three eyes with deteriorated VA underwent vitrectomy due to macular hole or pseudomacular hole. Vitreal tryptase activity was significantly higher in patients with ERM compared to those with PDR (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONFundus photos of ERM auto-peeling were taken during long-term follow-up. Spontaneous release of ERM is possibly involved in vitreous traction or membrane contraction. In addition, tryptase may be involved in the development and contraction of ERM.",0,1541

Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants with evidence of poor adherence. Six additional key informant interviews (female = 6) were conducted with healthcare workers. Data were collected and analysed inductively by an interdisciplinary coding team.RESULTSThe major challenges faced by participants were stressors (poverty, stigma, marital problems) and symptoms of CMDs ('thinking too much', changes to appetite and sleep, 'burdened heart' and low energy levels). Thinking too much, which appears closely related to rumination, was the symptom with the greatest negative impact on adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive adults with CMDs. In turn, thinking too much was commonly triggered by the stressors faced by people living with HIV/AIDS, especially poverty. Finally, participants desired private counselling, access to income-generating activities and family engagement in mental health care.CONCLUSIONSBetter understanding of the local expression of mental disorders and of underlying stressors can inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce CMDs and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy.",0,1542

We discuss the effects of health disorders on cow behavior and production, specifically those variables that are routinely recorded by AMS and associated technologies. This information is used to inform the resultant use of behavior and production variables and to summarize and critique current illness detection studies. For conventional and AMS herds separately, we examined research from the past 20 yr and those variables recorded automatically on-farm that may respond to development of illness and lameness. The main variables identified were milk yield, rumination time, activity, and body weight, in addition to frequency of successful, refused, and fetched (involuntary) milkings in AMS herds. Whether making comparisons within cow or between sick and healthy cows, consistent reductions in activity, rumination time, and milk yield are observed. Lameness, however, had obvious negative effects on milk yield but not necessarily on rumination time or activity. Finally, we discuss detection models for identifying lameness and other health disorders using routinely collected data in AMS, specifically focusing on their scientific validation and any study limitations that create a need for further research. Of the current studies that have worked toward disease detection, many data have been excluded or separated for isolated models (i.e., fresh cows, certain lactation groups, and cows with multiple illnesses or moderate cases). Thus, future studies should (1) incorporate the entire lactating herd while accounting for stage of lactation and parity of each animal; (2) evaluate the deviations that cows exhibit from their own baseline trajectories and relative to healthy contemporaries; (3) combine the use of several variables into health alerts; and (4) differentiate the probable type of health disorder. Most importantly, no model or software currently exists to integrate data and directly support decision-making, which requires further research to bridge the gap between technology and herd health management.",0,1543

WIREs Cognitive Science 3(3","Depression is a prevalent and impairing psychiatric disorder that affects how we feel and how we think about ourselves and the world around us. Cognitive theories of depression have long posited that various thought processes are involved in the development, maintenance, and recurrence of depressive episodes. Contemporary research has utilized experimental procedures to examine cognitive processes in depressed individuals as well as the nature of the relation of these processes to the emotion dysregulation that is central to the disorder. For example, investigators have assessed the ways in which depression alters aspects of information processing, including attention and perception, interpretation, and memory processes; this research has generated relatively consistent findings. In addition, researchers have attempted to identify and elucidate the cognitive mechanisms that may link these biases in information processing to emotion dysregulation in depression. These mechanisms include inhibitory processes and deficits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. Results of these investigations converge on the formulation that depression is associated with increased elaboration of negative information, difficulties in cognitive control when processing this information, and difficulties disengaging from this information. Research examining cognitive aspects of depression not only enhances our understanding of this common and costly disorder, but also has implications for the treatment of depression and for future investigations of the biological foundations of this disorder.

We show that lateral authority, the legitimacy to resolve task‐specific problems, is welcomed by members of an organization in the resolution of coordination conflicts, the more so (a) the fiercer the conflict to be resolved, (b) the higher the competence‐based status of the authority, (c) the lower the tenure of, and (d) the more focused the organizational members are. Analyzing the discussion behavior of members of Wikipedia between 2002 and 2014, we corroborate our allegations empirically by analyzing 642,916 article–discussion pages. Our findings, obtained for a modern collective production community, provide learning opportunities for how traditional organizations may want to govern activities of their idiosyncratically motivated staff. Managerial Summary: When managers use their (legitimate) power to take decisions on behalf of their staff, they risk setting back employees and making them detach from the firm. This danger is particularly salient whenever highly motivated teams of staff autonomously work on corporate problems and are used to governing themselves. Examples range from skunkwork initiatives within traditional firms to entire team‐based organizations, such as Valve or Zappos. When and how managers can add value by resolving conflicts within and across these teams once their self‐organization fails is what we study in this article. Inspired by data from Wikipedia, we suggest that managers should not intervene prematurely, benefit from visible competence, and are respected most for their actions by specialized peers who recently joined the organization.

A two-rater independent literature search was conducted using the PubMed/Google Scholar search engines to systematically evaluate the literature on the research objectives, followed by a critical reflection on the results. Of the 77 screened studies, 15 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Patients with gynecologic malignancies, especially cervical cancer, had a very high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms including depression (33%-52%). Additionally, the risk groups facing higher rates of concomitant reduced quality of life and increased psychiatric symptoms such as depression were identified. Specifically, low socioeconomic status, sexual inactivity, absence of a partner, and physical symptoms were correlated with an increased risk. Patients suffering from recurrent gynecologic cancer should receive particular attention because of their significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms. Screening programs are needed to detect psychiatric symptoms in cervical cancer patients and the associated high-risk groups.

Our aim is to help fill the gap in the literature and facilitate further studies of the exploration process by providing an appropriate instrument to measure exploration in breadth during early adolescence. As a coherent and mature sense of identity is closely associated with psychosocial well-being, an effective identity exploration scale will enable researchers to assess the predictors of young adolescents' well-being. We propose a model of identity exploration domains based on the literature and considering 12 exploration domains: physical appearance, free time, family, work, boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, own opinion formation, perception of own place in the life cycle, self-reflection, future, future family, outlook on life, and attitude toward rules.

Infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy measurements at low temperature (∼20 K) have shown that the softened CH stretching band consists of several sharp peaks. At temperatures above 80 K, each peak is broadened, most probably by anharmonic coupling with thermally excited low-energy frustrated translational modes. The origin of fine structure in this band and its similarity to that in hydrogen bond systems are discussed. In addition, novel isotope effects were observed in desorption kinetics and adsorption geometry of cyclohexane on Rh(111) using temperature programmed desorption, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and spot profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction. The desorption energy of deuterated cyclohexane (C6 D12 ) is lower than that of C6 H12 (inverse kinetic isotope effect). In addition, the work function change by adsorbed C6 D12 is smaller than that by adsorbed C6 H12 . These results indicate that C6 D12 molecules are slightly more distant from the surface than C6 H12 molecules (vertical geometric isotope effect). A lateral geometric isotope effect was also observed for the two-dimensional cyclohexane superstructures as a result of the repulsive interaction between interfacial dipoles (= work function change). These isotope effects are ascribed to the quantum nature of hydrogen involved in the C-H···M interaction.",0,1549

Determinants of these outcomes beyond residual symptom levels have rarely been investigated. The present study aimed at investigating prospective effects of demographic variables, depression levels, and response styles to depressed mood on future psychosocial functioning outcomes in depressed patients. Methods: We followed up a sample of unipolar depressed inpatients (n = 71) one, six, 42, and 66 months after hospital discharge. At each measuring point, patients were assessed with regard to diagnostic status, symptom levels, response styles, subjective quality of life (QoL), and interviewer-rated social and occupational functioning. Longitudinal data were analyzed using time-lagged linear models. Results: Controlled for age, sex, and concurrent depression levels, higher symptom-focused rumination predicted lower future QoL in the psychological domain and lower social and occupational functioning. In parallel, higher levels of habitual distraction predicted higher future QoL in the psychological domain. Effects were comparable for men and women. Conclusion: Given that response styles to depressed mood appear not only to affect the course of depressive symptoms but also future psychosocial outcomes, it is of particular relevance to address these coping styles in psychological therapies for depression and high-risk groups. Future controlled intervention studies should investigate possible specific mechanisms of how response styles may affect psychosocial outcomes.

PVR is the most common cause of failed repair of rhegmatogenous RD, and risk factors for PVR are related to several well-known pre-, intra-, and postoperative clinical situations. Current methods of surgical management of RD and PVR are pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Surgical success rates for PVR have improved as techniques and instruments of vitrectomy evolved. However, despite these advances, more than one fourth of initially successful cases results in redetachment due to recurrent vitreoretinal traction. Retinal pigment epithelial cells are the key factor in triggering PVR development. In addition, soluble mediators and the extracellular matrix components play a critical role in cellular events, including proliferation and tissue contraction which occur in PVR. Although PPV remains a critical component of the treatment in RD and PVR, ongoing efforts seek to identify adjuvant therapies that might inhibit PVR development. Recent studies have therefore been directed toward pharmacologic inhibition of cellular proliferation and membrane contraction with drugs such as daunorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and heparin. More detailed understanding of the pathophysiology underlying PVR may lead to the development of effective prophylactic and/or adjunctive therapies. Further work is necessary to identify optimal adjunctive therapies for the management of RD and PVR.",0,1555

In addition, the book is beautifully written. The mindfulness approach is about maintaining treatment gains and preventing relapse. Therapists using hypnosis will be able to incorporate many of these techniques into a hypnotic context with ease. To start with, the point is made that most of us function in 'doing mode'. When things get sticky, most of us react to a need for change to make things more ideal. We strive, maybe exhausting ourselves in the process, and as our mood becomes more negative, those of us prone to depression can descend into patterns of thought and behaviour that are repetitive, ruminative and self-perpetuating. The book argues that it is more useful to be in a 'being mode' without goals in these circumstances, and with no need to monitor how one is doing on the quest. Personally, we think that a term such as 'driven mode' would be more descriptive than 'doing mode'. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1558

The research focuses on the costs and benefits arising from the interactive effects of detachment and concern on burnout for those in human service professions with intensive client interaction. Based on cross-sectional, self-reported survey data, we studied the impact of DC on employees’ well-being in a 2-stage procedure. In Study 1 (N = 262 kindergarten workers), we investigated the factor structure of the DC measure. In Study 2 (N = 1,011 employees from different human service professions), we confirmed the factor structure and examined the directions and degrees of congruence or incongruence of detachment and concern on burnout using polynomial regression. Slope analysis confirmed that for professionals a congruence at higher values of detachment and concern (balanced DC) resulted in the lowest levels of burnout. Low concern combined with low detachment produced the highest burnout levels. Significantly higher exhaustion was observed when concern surpassed detachment, particularly when high concern was associated with low detachment. Professionals’ depersonalization increased when detachment surpassed concern. Findings highlight the beneficial effects in terms of burnout when human service professionals have a balance of high concern and high detachment.

It includes survey data, formal and informal student feedback, and a number of interviews in which students describe how aspects of this learning-centred approach have interacted with their music-making and their career expectations.

Journal of biomedical optics 20(8","Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a standard tool in ophthalmology clinics for diagnosing many retinal diseases. Nonetheless, the technical and clinical communities still lack a standardized phantom that could aid in evaluating and normalizing the many protocols and systems used for diagnosis. Existing retinal phantoms are able to mimic the thickness and scattering properties of the retinal layers but are unable to model the morphology of the foveal pit, particularly the tapering of the retinal layers. This work demonstrates a new fabrication procedure that is capable of reliably and consistently replicating the shape and tapered appearance of the retinal layers near the foveal pit using a combination of spin-coating and replica molding. We characterize the effects of using different mold sizes which enable us to achieve a range of pit dimensions. We also present a modified procedure to replicate two diseased states of the retinal tissue, such as retinal detachment and dry aged-related macular degeneration. The ability to create an anatomically correct foveal pit for healthy and disease-mimicking phantoms will allow for a new standard better suited for intra- and inter-system evaluation and for improved comparison of retinal segmentation algorithms",0,1567

Nurse education today 40: 219-224.","BACKGROUNDHigh-fidelity simulation (HFS) has become a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical skills. A safe and realistic environment is commonly used in nursing education to improve cognitive, affective and psychomotor abilities. Debriefing following a simulation experience provides opportunities for students to analyze and begin to reflect upon their decisions, actions and results. The nursing literature highlights the need to promote the concept of reflective practice and to assist students in reflection, and research indicates the need to refine and develop debriefing strategies, which is the focus of the current paper.PURPOSETo explore the value of reflections after HFS by investigating nursing students' perceptions of their learning when a Three-step Post-simulation Reflection Model is used.DESIGNA qualitative descriptive research approach was applied.METHODA Three-step Post-simulation Reflection Model that combined written and verbal reflections was used after an HFS experience in a second-year course in the Bachelor Program in Nursing at Luleå University of Technology, Sweden. Reflective texts written before and after a verbal group reflection were subjected to qualitative content analysis.FINDINGSThe main theme in the first written reflections was identified as ""Starting to act as a nurse"", with the following categories: feeling stressed, inadequate and inexperienced; developing an awareness of the importance of never compromising patient safety; planning the work and prioritizing; and beginning to understand and implement nursing knowledge. The main theme in the second written reflections was identified to be ""Maturing in the profession"", with the following categories: appreciating colleagues, good communication and thoughtfulness; gaining increased self-awareness and confidence; and beginning to understand the profession.CONCLUSIONThe Three-step Post-simulation Reflection Model fostered an appreciation of clear and effective communication. Having time for thoughtfulness and reflection promotes self-awareness and a better understanding of both the nursing profession and patient safety. The progress demonstrated in the depth of the themes in the written reflections indicates that repeated reflections stimulate and enhance student learning. The findings point towards the potential effectiveness of alternate methods of reflections.",0,1568

Time 1 (T1) shifting, inhibition, and working memory (WM) were assessed in relation to T1 and time 2 (T2) depressive symptoms in participants pre-selected to range in risk for depression. Analyses indicated that poorer EF at T1 predicted increases in depressive symptoms and furthermore that this relationship was specific to WM. In contrast, a bidirectional relationship was not evident, as depressive symptoms did not prospectively predict changes in EF. Finally, T1 EF accounted for T2 depressive symptoms beyond two well established predictors of depression: depressive symptoms at T1 and rumination at T2.

Social Work Education 26(4","The social work profession has always been involved in dealing with uncertainty and risk in the life politics of clients. However, it is not easy for young social work students to translate this philosophical disposition into their real life practice with clients. In spring 2003, when the SARS epidemic broke out in Hong Kong, a group of social work students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong were doing their fieldwork practicum. Suddenly confronted by a collective sense of risk in their role as social workers, the students went through a period of unrest, as performing their helping duties brought with it a simultaneous exposure to personal risk. This paper is based on four focus group interviews with these social work students, to understand how they processed their experience of risk during their exposure to the SARS crisis, and how they connected the experience to their social work practice with clients. It is found that the predicament arising from the exposure to personal risk brought about by the SARS crisis during the students' field placement engendered the reflective process that enabled a renewed and personalized meaning of professionalism. The results provide a basis for reflection among social work educators on the role of risk in the training of prospective social workers, and on how social work education can better prepare students for practice in a high-risk environment.

American journal of ophthalmology 137(6","PURPOSETo evaluate the ability of delayed hyperoxia to slow or prevent degenerative and gliotic changes initiated by retinal detachment.DESIGNAn experimental study.METHODSRhegmatogenous detachments were produced in the right eyes of eight cats. After 1 day in room air (21% O(2)), four cats were placed in chambers with the O(2) concentration regulated at 70%; the other four were left in room air. At 7 days the retinas were harvested and examined by light and confocal microscopy. Cell specific antibodies, TUNEL and proliferation assays, outer segment length, and photoreceptor counts, were used to assess the condition of the retina. The contralateral unoperated eyes were used as controls.RESULTSAnimals maintained in elevated O(2) showed a dramatic preservation of rod and cone outer segments as well as in the organization of the outer plexiform layer. The number of surviving photoreceptors was increased in the hyperoxia-treated animals. Neurite sprouting, a characteristic of detached retina, was rarely observed in the experimental eyes. Proliferation of non-neuronal cells was reduced, but not halted, by hyperoxia. GFAP and vimentin expression was not effected by hyperoxia; these intermediate filament proteins increased in Müller cells similar to that observed in control detachments.CONCLUSIONSExposure to hyperoxia, delayed by 1 day after the onset of retinal detachment, was highly effective in preserving photoreceptor cells and in reducing proliferation within the retina. It did not, however, reduce the hypertrophy of Müller glia. There were no apparent detrimental effects of exposure to 70% O(2) for 6 days. These results suggest that human patients may benefit from breathing elevated oxygen levels while awaiting reattachment surgery, even if the hyperoxia is delayed relative to the time of detachment.",0,1571

Journal of Neurophysiology 116(6","The superior colliculus is a major brain stem structure for the production of saccadic eye movements. Electrical stimulation at any given point in the motor map generates saccades of defined amplitude and direction. It is unknown how this saccade map is affected by strabismus. Three macaques were raised with exotropia, an outwards ocular deviation, by detaching the medial rectus tendon in each eye at age 1 mo. The animals were able to make saccades to targets with either eye and appeared to alternate fixation freely. To probe the organization of the superior colliculus, microstimulation was applied at multiple sites, with the animals either free-viewing or fixating a target. On average, microstimulation drove nearly conjugate saccades, similar in both amplitude and direction but separated by the ocular deviation. Two monkeys showed a pattern deviation, characterized by a systematic change in the relative position of the two eyes with certain changes in gaze angle. These animals’ saccades were slightly different for the right eye and left eye in their amplitude or direction. The differences were consistent with the animals’ underlying pattern deviation, measured during static fixation and smooth pursuit. The tectal map for saccade generation appears to be normal in strabismus, but saccades may be affected by changes in the strabismic deviation that occur with different gaze angles.

In addition, 100 mum-thick vibratome sections were immunolabeled with markers for photoreceptor terminals, HCs, and RBs. More than 40 rod spherules were studied in 90 nm-thick serial sections by transmission EM to greater detail changes in their ultrastructure and innervation.RESULTSFollowing retinal detachment, many rod terminals retracted varying distances toward their respective cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). In retinas detached for 1 to 4 weeks, an altered synaptic vesicle population and associated ribbons were found in all retracting terminals. Many rod somata in the distal ONL seemed to lack synaptic terminal structures altogether. In a retina detached for 1 week, EM showed that less than half of the retracted terminals remain in contact with RB dendrites. In contrast, almost every surviving spherule was contacted by neurite outgrowths from the axon terminals of the B-type HC. Although retracted spherules had several presynaptic structures similar to those in normal retina, numerous changes occurred in their overall synaptic architecture. The spherule's invagination was shallower, contained fewer postsynaptic processes, and often had ""opened,"" allowing swollen HC processes apposing the synaptic ribbon to directly contact other processes of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) neuropil. Whereas in normal cat retina each HC ""lobe"" comes from a different axon terminal system, after detachment, the opposing lateral elements can stem from the same terminal. The innervating RB dendrites that branched off stout RB dendritic trunks that extended up into the ONL were thinner than normal, unbranched, often electron dense, and lacked organelles. When present, most merely lay adjacent to retracting spherules rather than enter any synaptic invagination that might still occur.CONCLUSIONSImmunocytochemistry enabled RB and HC neurites to appear postsynaptic to retracted rod terminals. However, at the ultrastructural level, HCs seemed to more consistently retain connection with the retracted spherules than the RBs. The highly conserved architecture of the rod spherule was lost as the invagination opened and postsynaptic contacts became fewer. It would seem that the lack of RB central elements as well as the drastic alterations in the architecture of most retracted terminals would necessarily alter the physiology of this complex synapse.",0,1578

Advances in Health Sciences Education 14(4","Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is now key to the undergraduate medical curriculum and requires provision of appropriate learning experiences. In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ascertain students’ perceptions of what is important in their PPD. We required a methodological approach suitable for a large medical school, which defines constructs used by the students to describe their PPD, and is not constrained by a researcher’s predetermined line of questioning. It should also quantify the saliencies of these constructs in the student population and indicate how they gauge their own PPD. The instrument should also be suitable for administration at key stages of the students’ learning experience. Here we describe the first stages in developing a novel method, which fulfils these requirements. It is based on a modified self repertory grid, the 'Ideal Self' Inventory. All first year students (N = 379), provided five descriptors of a 'good medical student' and of a not very good medical student, which generated 1,531 ‘ideal’ qualities. To define underlying themed constructs, 49 randomly selected descriptors, were grouped together by self selected students (n = 55), using commonly held assumptions.

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges 77(11","OBJECTIVEThe early 1990s sparked an interest in organized medicine to reclaim and re-evaluate how it promotes professionalism among physicians. The American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) launched Project Professionalism as a means to define and evaluate professionalism as a component of clinical competence. The course ""Talking Medicine"" was developed to create a series of small-group discussions on humanism and professionalism where students can reflect on the process of becoming a physician and share personally or ethically difficult and rewarding cases with each other. We asked students to define these concepts and use these definitions to spark small-group discussion.DESCRIPTION""Talking Medicine"" is predicated on the belief that humanism and professionalism come to students and others through understanding a number of core concepts and relationships complemented by self-reflection. ""Talking Medicine"" offers a consistent (every other week for ten weeks) opportunity to share experiences in small groups (six to eight students), facilitated by two preceptors, in a format driven by students' experiences. Although the focus is on students' experiences, readings are provided on basic topics and contexts in humanism and professionalism (e.g., end-of-life care, mistakes, spirituality in medicine, and boundaries between patients and doctors). Also, at the beginning of each internal medicine clerkship we asked students to define humanism and professionalism anonymously on sheets of paper to be handed to the preceptors.DISCUSSION""Talking Medicine"" began in summer 2000. We hope to expand it to other institutions. We surveyed students and found 94% felt ""very"" or ""somewhat"" comfortable in the course. Seventy-three percent of students reported that the course increased their ""connectedness"" to classmates, and 61% favored its occurring during all rotations. Fifty-nine percent reported that their interest in caring for patients improved, and 53% reported their interest in internal medicine as a field improved. Answers to open-ended questions highlighted the importance of ""Talking Medicine"" as a forum to connect with others-both students and faculty. Despite this course's focus during an internal medicine clerkship, students see a broader definition of professionalism than the ABIM; the student's definitions were similar in many ways to the Group of Educational Affairs definition of professionalism. Third-year medical students focus more on tolerance of difference (e.g., race, socioeconomic status, and varying health beliefs), and the importance of collegiality and collaboration in the new environment of patient care. Their vantage point early in training allows them to look critically at the profession they are joining and view its shortcomings and strengths. Future work is needed that focuses on how these definitions change as students' progress through fourth year, into residency, and finally continuing medical education. Nevertheless, we suggest that ""Talking Medicine"" may be most effective in helping classmates connect to and learn from each other, thereby setting a foundation for changes in how they interact with patients.",0,1584

In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of excited-state I(-)(H(2)O)(5) and (H(2)O)(5)(-) are performed, and the simulated time evolution of their structural and electronic properties are compared to determine unambiguously the respective roles of the water molecules and the iodine atom in the electron stabilization dynamics. Results indicate that, driven by the iodine-hydrogen repulsive interactions, excited I(-)(H(2)O)(5) rearranges significantly from the initial ground-state minimum energy configuration to bind the excited electron more tightly. By contrast, (H(2)O)(5)(-) rearranges less dramatically from the corresponding configuration due to the lack of the same iodine-hydrogen interactions. Despite the critical role of iodine for driving reorganization in excited I(-)(H(2)O)(5), excited-electron vertical detachment energies appear to be determined mostly by the water cluster configuration, suggesting that femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy primarily probes solvent reorganization in photoexcited I(-)(H(2)O)(5).",0,1587

Experimental cell research 270(1","Cell cycle block in G(2)/M initiates apoptosis, but the mechanism of this signaling cascade are largely unknown. The microtubule-perturbing agent Taxol has multiple effects on this signaling pathway and is a potent inducer of apoptosis. The specific pathways activated by low, clinically relevant concentrations of the drug are still largely unknown and are dependent on cell type and drug concentration. In this work, we have investigated why HeLa cells respond to Taxol by undergoing complete apoptosis, whereas MCF-7 cells remain in an intermediate phase with reduced death. Three phases were distinguished in these apoptotic pathways. The initial phase characterized by cellular detachment is followed by a second phase which includes the onset of apoptotic morphology, and p38 and Bcl-2 phosphorylation. These two phases are common to both cell lines. HeLa cells then proceed to the third and final execution phase, which culminates in death, whereas MCF-7 cells do not progress. Interestingly, the isoflavonoid Quercetin, a known general kinase inhibitor and an antioxidant, was able to prevent the onset of Taxol-induced cellular detachment and to protect from cell death. Moreover, it blocked Taxol-induced phosphorylation of p38 and Bcl-2, and prevented a Taxol-induced change in relative mobility of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1).

Curr Top Behav Neurosci 36: 137-158.","The classic serotonergic hallucinogens, or psychedelics, have the ability to profoundly alter perception and behavior. These can include visual distortions, hallucinations, detachment from reality, and mystical experiences. Some psychedelics, like LSD, are able to produce these effects with remarkably low doses of drug. Others, like psilocybin, have recently been demonstrated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction that persist for at least several months after only a single therapeutic session. How does this occur? Much work has recently been published from imaging studies showing that psychedelics alter brain network connectivity. They facilitate a disintegration of the default mode network, producing a hyperconnectivity between brain regions that allow centers that do not normally communicate with each other to do so. The immediate and acute effects on both behaviors and network connectivity are likely mediated by effector pathways downstream of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. These acute molecular processes also influence gene expression changes, which likely influence synaptic plasticity and facilitate more long-term changes in brain neurochemistry ultimately underlying the therapeutic efficacy of a single administration to achieve long-lasting effects. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the molecular genetic responses to psychedelics within the brain and discuss how gene expression changes may contribute to altered cellular physiology and behaviors.",0,1595

Mental Health and Physical Activity 14: 19-30.","Purpose: Autobiographical memory is crucial to goal attainment, thus it may influence coping with chronic illness. Autobiographical memory was investigated in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and healthy people. Two contrasting hypotheses were tested. On the basis of Williams and colleagues’ model of overgeneral memories in depression, and the high co-morbidity between CFS/ME and depression, we predicted overgeneral autobiographical memories in the CFS/ME group. In contrast, on the basis of a postulated oversensitization of the central nervous system in the CFS/ME population and their amplified attention towards anything that might threaten their energy balance, such as activity, we predicted that autobiographical activity memories in CFS/ME would be more specific than in healthy controls. Methods: We employed modified cued autobiographic recall in CFS/ME (N = 89) and healthy (N = 61) participants, who were asked to recall particular past events when they experienced happiness, pain, fatigue, or were physically active. Levels of psychological distress, rumination, and behavioural disengagement were assessed. Results: CFS/ME participants recalled significantly more specific autobiographical memories of past physical activity, compared to healthy controls. Within the CFS/ME group, lower levels of ruminating about past activity were significantly related to greater specificity in recall of activity. Further, those CFS/ME participants who recalled more specific autobiographical activity memories reported significantly lower levels of behavioural disengagement. Conclusion: CFS/ME individuals’ autobiographical memory for activity differs both from healthy individuals and the typical pattern found in depression. The effect of specific activity memories could be utilized in exercise-based treatment of CFS/ME. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1596

Moreover, symptoms of anxiety and depression, such as worry and rumination, contribute to insomnia. Given these relationships, there is a need to delineate how these disorders respond to treatment when they are comorbid. Methods: 266 individuals presenting for anxiety and/or depression symptoms participated in this study in which symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, disability, and sleep length were assessed. 102 of these patients were treated with internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for anxiety and/or depression and 61 completed the treatment. Pre- to post-treatment symptom changes were examined in this subset. Results: Insomnia, as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, was evident in 40% of the patients. Individuals with insomnia reported more severe symptoms of anxiety and depression than individuals without insomnia. iCBT focused on anxiety and/or depression was associated with reductions in symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and disability. Total sleep time did not change over treatment. Limitations: As the data were collected in routine care, there was no control group and no longer term follow-up assessment. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of insomnia across anxiety and depressive disorders. They further demonstrate that treatment for anxiety and/or depression appears to improve comorbid insomnia symptoms, though may be ineffective in changing sleep duration.

We previously demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells cultured in diabetic-like conditions are able to enter the pericytes, causing their detachment and migration, and stimulating angiogenesis in vitro. The purpose of this work was the molecular and functional characterization of EVs derived from diabetic subjects with or without diabetic retinopathy, compared with healthy controls. Characterization of EVs extracted from serum/plasma of diabetic patients with or without retinopathy, and healthy controls, was performed by FACS and microarray analysis of microRNA (miRNA) content. Relevant miRNA expression was validated through qRT-PCR. EV influence on pericyte detachment, angiogenesis and permeability of the blood-retinal barrier was also investigated. Diabetic subjects had a 2.5 fold higher EV concentration than controls, while expression of surface molecules was unchanged. Microarray analysis revealed 11 differentially expressed miRNAs. Three of them (miR-150-5p, miR-21-3p and miR-30b-5p) were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Plasma EVs from subjects with diabetic retinopathy induced pericyte detachment and pericyte/endothelial cell migration, increased the permeability of pericyte/endothelial cell bilayers and the formation of vessel-like structures, when compared with EVs from controls. In conclusion, circulating EVs show differences between diabetic patients and healthy subjects. EVs extracted from plasma of diabetic retinopathy patients are able to induce features of retinopathy in in vitro models of retinal microvasculature.

Facilitators, knowledge brokers and opinion leaders are examples of change agency strategies used to promote knowledge utilization. This review adopts a realist approach and addresses the following question: What change agency characteristics work, for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why?METHODSThe literature reviewed spanned the period 1997-2007. Change agency was operationalized as roles that are aimed at effecting successful change in individuals and organizations. A theoretical framework, developed through stakeholder consultation formed the basis for a search for relevant literature. Team members, working in sub groups, independently themed the data and developed chains of inference to form a series of hypotheses regarding change agency and the role of change agency in knowledge use.RESULTS24, 478 electronic references were initially returned from search strategies. Preliminary screening of the article titles reduced the list of potentially relevant papers to 196. A review of full document versions of potentially relevant papers resulted in a final list of 52 papers. The findings add to the knowledge of change agency as they raise issues pertaining to how change agents' function, how individual change agent characteristics effect evidence-informed health care, the influence of interaction between the change agent and the setting and the overall effect of change agency on knowledge utilization. Particular issues are raised such as how accessibility of the change agent, their cultural compatibility and their attitude mediate overall effectiveness. Findings also indicate the importance of promoting reflection on practice and role modeling. The findings of this study are limited by the complexity and diversity of the change agency literature, poor indexing of literature and a lack of theory-driven approaches.CONCLUSIONThis is the first realist review of change agency.

Journal of medical Internet research 20(7","BACKGROUNDToday, college students are dealing with depression at some of the highest rates in decades. As the primary mental health service provider, university counseling centers are limited in their capacity and efficiency to provide mental health care due to time constraints and reliance on students' self-reports. A mobile behavioral-sensing platform may serve as a solution to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of university counseling services.OBJECTIVEThe main objectives of this study are to (1) understand the usefulness of a mobile sensing platform (ie, iSee) in improving counseling services and assisting students' self-management of their depression conditions, and (2) explore what types of behavioral targets (ie, meaningful information extracted from raw sensor data) and feedback to deliver from both clinician and students' perspectives.METHODSWe conducted semistructured interviews with 9 clinicians and 12 students with depression recruited from a counseling center at a large Midwestern university. The interviews were 40-50 minutes long and were audio recorded and transcribed. The interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis with an inductive approach. Clinician and student interviews were analyzed separately for comparison. The process of extracting themes involved iterative coding, memo writing, theme revisits, and refinement.RESULTSFrom the clinician perspective, the mobile sensing platform helps to improve counseling service by providing objective evidence for clinicians and filling gaps in clinician-patient communication. Clinicians suggested providing students with their sensed behavioral targets organized around personalized goals. Clinicians also recommended delivering therapeutic feedback to students based on their sensed behavioral targets, including positive reinforcement, reflection reminders, and challenging negative thoughts. From the student perspective, the mobile sensing platform helps to ease continued self-tracking practices. Students expressed their need for integrated behavioral targets to understand correlations between behaviors and depression. They also pointed out that they would prefer to avoid seeing negative feedback.CONCLUSIONSAlthough clinician and student participants shared views on the advantages of iSee in supporting university counseling, they had divergent opinions on the types of behavioral targets and feedback to be provided via iSee. This exploratory work gained initial insights into the design of a mobile sensing platform for depression management and informed a more conclusive research project for the future.",0,1612

BMC psychology 6(1","BACKGROUNDStudents following a low education track have an increased risk for developing problem behaviors. Rock and Water is a widespread, but still poorly evaluated, intervention that aims to improve students' socio-emotional adjustment and social safety. The aims of this study are to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of Rock and Water on socio-emotional adjustment (i.e., psychosocial wellbeing, sexual autonomy, and resilience) and social safety (i.e., perceived social security in the classroom, aggression, and bullying) and to examine (2) moderators and (3) mediators of its effects.METHODSSchools are randomly assigned into four conditions: 'Light' (a core team of teachers is trained), 'Standard' (a core team of teachers and the whole school team is trained), 'Plus' (a core team of teachers, the whole school team is trained, and parents are involved), or 'Control condition' (Care As Usual). We aim to include 180 7th Grade students in each condition (N = 720) across all waves. A multi-informant (i.e., students, parents, and teachers) approach is used to assess the outcomes (socio-emotional adjustment and social safety), moderators (student, trainer, and parent characteristics) and mediators (self-control, self-reflection, self-esteem, and emotion regulation). Video-observations will be analyzed in a subsample to study the possible mediating effect of changes in deviant and prosocial communication among students on the effect on social safety.DISCUSSIONThis project will provide information on the effectiveness of (different levels of school and parental involvement in) Rock and Water, which can be used by schools to decide upon the most efficient way to improve the care for the students.

Scientific reports 6: 25101.","In cancer, defective E-cadherin leads to cell detachment, migration and metastization. Further, alterations mediated by E-cadherin dysfunction affect cell topology and tissue organization. Herein, we propose a novel quantitative approach, based on microscopy images, to analyse abnormal cellular distribution patterns. We generated undirected graphs composed by sets of triangles which accurately reproduce cell positioning and structural organization within each image. Network analysis was developed by exploring triangle geometric features, namely area, edges length and formed angles, as well as their variance, when compared with the respective equilateral triangles. We generated synthetic networks, mimicking the diversity of cell-cell interaction patterns, and evaluated the applicability of the selected metrics to study topological features. Cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin and cancer-related mutants were used to validate our strategy. Specifically, A634V, R749W and P799R cancer-causing mutants present more disorganized spatial distribution when compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, P799R exhibited higher length and angle distortions and abnormal cytoskeletal organization, suggesting the formation of very dynamic and plastic cellular interactions. Hence, topological analysis of cell network diagrams is an effective tool to quantify changes in cell-cell interactions and, importantly, it can be applied to a myriad of processes, namely tissue morphogenesis and cancer.",0,1614

Community mobilization and engagement play a critical role in many evidence-based programs and strategies, as it takes a concerted effort among a wide range of people within a community to alter behavior and maintain behavioral change. How do concerned individuals and groups within a community engage others within and outside of that community to effectively plan, develop and implement appropriate EB programs as well as evaluate the outcomes and impacts of locally developed programs yet to be proven? The authors discuss five elements essential for community engagement in evidence-based youth violence prevention based on their work in a university-community partnership through the Asian/Pacific Islander Youth Violence Prevention Center (API Center), a National Academic Center for Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention Center supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They include: (a) aligning EBPs with a community's shared vision and values; (b) establishing an inclusive environment for the planning, implementation and evaluation of EBPs; (c) nurturing collaboration for increased effectiveness and efficacy of EBPs; (d) building adequate leadership and community capacity to develop and sustain EBPs; and (e) building a learning community for evaluation and self-reflection. The authors propose placing greater emphasis on ""evaluative thinking"" and organizational capacity for evaluation as we pursue evidence-based practices for youth violence prevention.

This process is the result of the Bologna Declaration of June 1999 which proposes and requires a series of reforms to make European Higher Education more compatible and comparable, more competitive and more attractive for Europeans students. The present paper reviews some of the results achieved in the field, focusing on several issues such as the shortage of physicians and primary care practitioners, the importance of public health, community medicine and medical humanities, and the implementation of new training approaches including e-learning and simulation. In the future, faculties should work on several specific challenges such as: students' mobility, the improvement of students' autonomy and critical thinking as well as their generic and specific skills and finally a reflection on how to improve the attractiveness of the academic career, for physicians of both sexes.",0,1617

The aims of this initiative were to facilitate: development of critical reflection; deployment of social work skills in a care home setting; and opportunities for social work students to work with care home residents. The learning was captured via four Experiential Groups facilitated by the Practice Educator with responsibility for assessing the students' practice. On-site supervisors also participated. Key learning included understanding of: the importance of critical reflection as a key social work skill; the influence of organisational norms and care home culture on the quality of care practice; the complexity and emotion-rich nature of person-centred care; and the pivotal role of relationships in work with people with dementia. Links made in the Groups—between the experiential and theoretical, the emotional and cognitive, and the structural and personal—demonstrate their value as learning platforms.

Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 29(5","Background: While much is known about the neuropharmacology and objective efficacy of antipsychotics, little is known about how these drugs act on psychosis from the patients' perspective. Most previous studies of the patient's perspective have focused on drug tolerability and acceptability--rather than their effects on psychosis per se. Methods: The authors examined how antipsychotics work from a patient's perspective by analyzing their responses to a subjective questionnaire. Ninety-one patients with schizophrenia (cross-sectional component) and eight neuroleptic naive patients (before and after treatment, longitudinal component) participated. The patients' responses to the questionnaire were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and general linear models. Results: Analysis of the patients' responses showed that from their perspective the drugs were substantially more effective in: 'help deal, help stop thinking, and make the symptoms not bother' rather than 'take away' or 'change my mind'. This differentiation was clear in the raw data and was supported by a formal PCA. Two underlying factors-the first termed detachment and second eradication-explained 71% of the variance in the patients' perspective on how antipsychotics work for them. Neuroleptic naive patients, who had no prior exposure, expected drugs to help with both detachment and eradication, but, changed their mind with just 6 weeks of experience with the medications. Conclusions: From the patients' perspective the action of antipsychotics is best characterized by a detachment from symptoms--rather than an eradication or elimination of symptoms. They have more wide-ranging expectations prior to antipsychotic exposure, but, even 6 weeks of exposure is sufficient to change their mind in favor of detachment. This finding is consistent with some of the very earliest ideas that antipsychotics produced a state of 'indifference' and is also consistent with the more recent, neurobiologically informed notions that antipsychotics work by dampening the salience of psychotic symptoms.

This article describes how women understand marriage's effects on their lives and their HIV risks. Drawing from focus group discussions with 72 women attending antiretroviral clinics in Malawi, we explore why women enter marriage, what women's experiences are within marriage and how they leave spouses for other relationships. Based on their narratives, we describe women's lives after separation, abandonment or widowhood, and report their reflections on marriage after being married two or three times. We then review women's narratives in light of published work on HIV, and provide recommendations that would minimise the risks of HIV attendant on marriage.",0,1624

The role played by caregivers cannot be overemphasised; yet caregivers who work in institutions caring for orphaned and/or abandoned children affected by HIV and AIDS, are often marginalised and on the periphery of the HIV and AIDS pandemic. The implication is that insufficient attention or consideration is given to the importance of the role they play in these children's lives. The objective of the study was to explore how female caregivers of institutionalised children affected by HIV and AIDS experience stress. A qualitative research project with a case study design was conducted. The purposively selected participants from a previously identified care facility were seven females in the age ranges of 35-59. Data was gathered during individual interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic content analysis of the data yielded the following themes: (1) contextualising caregiving as 'work'; (2) stresses linked to caregiving; and (3) coping with stress. Findings from this study indicated that participants experienced caregiving in an institution as stressful, demotivating, and emotionally burdensome. Moreover, caregivers working in an environment of HIV and AIDS experienced additional stress related to organisational and management impediments, lack of emotional and practical support, inadequate training, discipline difficulties, and lack of respect and appreciation from the children in their care. It is recommended that training and management support as well as personal support and counselling for caregivers in the institutional context could help them to cope better, feel empowered and to potentially elevate their status as valued members of society.",0,1625

Current literature highlights the importance of incorporating wireless devices in nursing organisations without discussing how effectively nurses can collect data. Good information is found on the factors of adoption and barriers associated with such devices in nursing however the evidence supplied in such findings is yet to be well substantiated. Therefore, this study conducted an investigation into the factors of adoption of wireless applications for data collection. By doing so, this review has attempted to fill-in the gap in the literature and provides insights into those factors that need to be given priority when implementing handheld technologies in nursing. The overarching aim of this systematic review was therefore to explore and confirm the facilitators and inhibitors to the adoption of handheld technology in nursing.OBJECTIVEThe objective of this review was to summarise the available evidence on the facilitators and inhibitors of adopting and utilising handheld wireless technology into the nursing profession. In particular this review set out to understand the supportive interventions that assist nurses to adjust to the use of such technology.INCLUSION CRITERIATypes of participants - This review was only interested in the nursing profession and was not limited to any one culture or setting. Therefore the review included nurses both Australian and overseas who were working in acute settings, community settings, and student nurses still in an academic setting.Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest - The review only considered studies that were endeavouring to understand the behavioural intention and user acceptance of handheld wireless technology (PDA's) in a nursing setting.Types of studies - This review considered studies that focus on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, ground theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research.Types of outcomes - Outcomes of interest were a strong reflection on the perception of nurses towards the technology and an identification of the major inhibitors and facilitators in adoption and utilisation of the technology.SEARCH STRATEGYA three-step search strategy was utilised in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms was then undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles was searched for additional studies.METHODOLOGICAL QUALITYEach paper was assessed by two reviewers for methodological quality prior to inclusion in the review using a critical appraisal instrument from Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) software developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), ().DATA COLLECTIONQualitative data was extracted from papers included in the review using the standardised data extraction tool from the JBI-QARI ().DATA SYNTHESISThe JBI Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) was utilised to merge similar findings into categories and then similar categories were again narrowed down to a common generic concept.RESULTSA total of 18 papers were retrieved. Of these, 11 were included in the review with all 11 being qualitative research papers. Reasons for the 7 papers being excluded from the review, were because experiences of nurses were not addressed (7 papers); the definition of nurse did not fit the inclusion criteria (2 papers); the concept ""Nurses utilising PDAs"" was not completely clear (1 paper). In addition all 7 of these papers were also excluded because of poor or incomplete descriptions of the methodology following critical appraisal usin the JBI-QARI critical appraisal tool. The findings of the remaining 11 papers were extracted and combined in the meta-synthesis. Key findings in this review included: The saving of nursing time; both advantages and disadvantage in assisting with information flow; the assistance of the technology with nurse decision making; varied opinions on the usability of the technology; positive links to nursing support; innovation diffusion considerations; and positive results on the use of the technology as an effective learning tool.CONCLUSIONSFindings of this systematic review provide sound evidence that information flow and real-time nurse decision making are enhanced with the use of PDAs in a clinical setting. What is clear is the technology can play a particularly important role in the pre-registered population of nurses still undergoing their training. Nursing support for this cohort would appear fundamental and hence the additional support given by using such technology would appear to enhance critical thinking skills and an ability to analyse evidence based practice information.Wireless connectively to the World Wide Web can expand the breadth of information made available to nursing staff and promote a safer and more therapeutic environment. The role PDAs may have in providing a safer medication administration environment for nurses needs to be investigated in greater depth. Issues of innovation diffusion require significant attention and manufacturers of these devices need to work with the nursing profession to find the most suitable design for a busy clinical setting. E-learning through the use of such technology would appear to have great potential and increase a nurse's exposure to education resources. This would seem of great benefit to student nurses in the academic sector.",0,1628

BMC international health and human rights 17(1","BACKGROUNDVoluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) is an HIV prevention strategy that promotes the principles of confidentiality and informed consent. International research has highlighted VCT counselors' isolation from service planning and the contradictions they negotiate between local values and global testing recommendations. In Brazil, studies have identified many limitations, including counselors' difficulties to implement a vulnerability approach to HIV prevention as recommended in the country's national guidelines. These studies, however, have not considered the particularities of the institutional contexts where counselors work. This research addresses these gaps in the VCT literature by exploring how VCT services are organized and how counselors perceive and perform their practices in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.METHODSThis is a case study of VCT services in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The research design included individual structured interviews with seven VCT service coordinators and twenty individual semi-structured interviews with VCT counselors. Participants were sampled according to gender, undergraduate degree and work trajectory to capture a diverse range counselor narratives.RESULTSThe VCT services were relatively homogenous in terms of functioning and had a similar restricted roll of activities including individual counseling and occasional external prevention activities with groups vulnerable to HIV. All VCT services reported reductions in staff size. Some counselors used dialogical practices to build trust, guarantee confidentiality and adjust their practices in accordance with their clients' values and practices. Others emphasized imperative messages or focused on risk and individual responsibility. Connections between how counselors perceive their practices and the organization of their work environment were observed.CONCLUSIONSDue to the importance of counseling as a prevention strategy we recommend rethinking the relationship between counselors' practices and the organization of VCT services. The challenges brought about by the expansion of ""test and treat"" programs globally and other social and symbolic aspects of the HIV epidemic, such as gender inequalities, must also be taken into account. Further reflection is also needed on the relationship between counseling guidelines and practices within the vulnerability approach to HIV prevention.",0,1630

Shared decision making (SDM) involves a set of principles and approaches to working with patients that integrates medical information and data with the preferences, values, and support systems of individual patients facing medical decisions. The value of SDM is increasingly evidenced by the incorporation of principles of SDM into the definitions of patient-centered care and PCMHs, accountable care organizations, and the language of the Health Reform Act of 2010.METHODSWe developed and integrated a curriculum on SDM in the third-year Family Medicine Clerkship at Dartmouth Medical School. The curriculum consisted of a mix of experiential, classroom, and online experiences designed to provide students with opportunities to learn content, practice skills, and share observations from their preceptorships.RESULTSStudent feedback was an important component of evaluating the SDM curriculum.

(2018"," ""waveCSD: A method for estimating transmembrane currents originated from propagating neuronal activity in the neocortex: Application to study cortical spreading depression."" Journal of neuroscience methods 307: 106-124.","BACKGROUNDRecent years have witnessed an upsurge in the development of methods for estimating current source densities (CSDs) in the neocortical tissue from their recorded local field potential (LFP) reflections using microelectrode arrays. Among these, methods utilizing linear arrays work under the assumption that CSDs vary as a function of cortical depth; whereas they are constant in the tangential direction, infinitely or in a confined cylinder. This assumption is violated in the analysis of neuronal activity propagating along the neocortical sheet, e.g. propagation of alpha waves or cortical spreading depression.NEW METHODHere, we developed a novel mathematical method (waveCSD) for CSD analysis of LFPs associated with a planar wave of neocortical neuronal activity propagating at a constant velocity towards a linear probe.RESULTSResults show that the algorithm is robust to the presence of noise in LFP data and uncertainties in knowledge of propagation velocity. Also, results show high level of accuracy of the method in a wide range of electrode resolutions. Using in vivo experimental recordings from the rat neocortex, we employed waveCSD to characterize transmembrane currents associated with cortical spreading depressions.COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)Simulation results indicate that waveCSD has a significantly higher reconstruction accuracy compared to the widely-used inverse CSD method (iCSD), and the regularized kernel CSD method (kCSD), in the analysis of CSDs originating from propagating neuronal activity.CONCLUSIONSThe waveCSD method provides a theoretical platform for estimation of transmembrane currents from their LFPs in experimental paradigms involving wave propagation.",0,1632

It investigates the complex interrelation between the institution and the periodical at a time when the latter was supposedly independent, and outlines the competing proposals for institutional publishing in science contemplated in the Royal Society, linking some publications that were actually attempted to those proposals and to the Society's attempts to revitalize its experimental programme between 1677 and 1687. It argues that the Society was concerned to produce experimental natural knowledge over which it could claim ownership, and intended this work for publication in other venues than Transactions, whereas the periodical was seen as a more suitable site for work reported to the Society than for research that the institution had primarily produced. It was only from the early 1690s, after the collapse of the Society's experimental programme, that Transactions gradually became a more straightforward reflection of the mainstream of Royal Society activity, paving the way for its formal reinvention as the official publication of the Society in 1752.",0,1635

Several streams of evidence indicate that pain education needs to address both the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain. Our aim was to design and deliver a new course in pain establishing foundation-level knowledge while comprehensively addressing the emotional development needs in this area.SETTINGOne hundred eighteen first-year medical students at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.OUTCOME MEASURESPerformance was measured by multiple-choice tests of pain knowledge, attendance, reflective pain portfolios, and satisfaction measures.RESULTSDomains of competence in pain knowledge included central and peripheral pain signalling, pharmacological management of pain with standard analgesic medications, neuromodulating agents, and opioids; cancer pain, musculoskeletal pain, nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic, geriatric, and pediatric pain. Socio-emotional development (portfolio) work focused on increasing awareness of pain affect in self and others, and on enhancing the commitment to excellence in pain care. Reflections included observations on a brief pain experience (cold pressor test), the multidimensionality of pain, the role of empathy and compassion in medical care, the positive characteristics of pain-care role models, the complex feelings engendered by pain and addiction including frustration and disappointment, and aspirations and commitments in clinical medicine. The students completing feedback expressed high levels of interest in pain medicine as a result of the course.DISCUSSIONWe conclude that a 4-day pain course incorporating sessions with pain specialists, pain medicine knowledge, and design-built elements to strengthen emotional skills is an effective educational approach.SUMMARYInnovations in medical education about pain are needed.

We were interested in finding out how mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) worked for programme participants by focussing on how meditative practices changed their relationships with their thoughts.DESIGNData for the study came from six semi-structured research interviews carried out with individuals who had taken part in an 8-week MBCT programme.METHODSWe used interpretative phenomenological analysis to analyse the experiential accounts.RESULTSWe report on two superordinate themes - Engaging the Neutral Mind (with subordinate themes 'breaking the paralysis of worry' and 'choosing to think differently') and Experiencing the Neutral Mind (with subordinate themes of 'reflection on previous thinking styles' and 'becoming psychologically self-reliant').CONCLUSIONSThemes from the present study offer support to the assertion that mindfulness meditation helps facilitate a different mode of meta-cognitive processing with which to handle depression-related cognitions.PRACTITIONER POINTSParticipants reported that they experienced an enhanced capacity to differentiate between their thought processes, experiencing an ability to tolerate some more uncomfortable thoughts, and experiencing a/more choice in how to respond to thoughts. Participants recognized that ruminating over negative thoughts was related to depressive states and experienced a shift in meta-cognitive processes that actively challenged depressogenic cognitions. Participants became more psychologically self-reliant and therapeutically independent following MBCT.

The concept of scholarship in teaching and learning has its foundations in Boyer's (1990) seminal work Scholarship Reconsidered. In this, Boyer made the case for teaching to be enhanced and made public and to be credited with equal weight as research activity within academic institutions. The activities of teaching and learning are truly academia's raison d'être however they get obscured in the mists of the importance placed on research activity. To this end it is vital that educators begin to critically examine their teaching to fully inform research and practice. One of the lenses through which this can be done is through the act of reflection. Reflection on action as a process first described by Schön in 1983 (Schön, 2005) necessitates not only the critical examination of what we do but also what are the underlying assumptions about why we do what we do.

Strategies for managing uncertainty have been studied among GPs but less is known about how medical students develop tolerance of uncertainty during their studies. The aim of this study was to investigate how the medical students experience uncertainty during their first clinical years and how their feelings develop with time as they progress from the 3rd year to the 4th year.METHODSThe material consisted of 22 students' reflective learning diaries and writings on specific themes collected during the 3rd and 4th year of their medical studies. The analysis was performed using thematic content analysis. In this article we present the results related to the theme of uncertainty.RESULTSUncertainty is a major cause of mental strain for medical students, particularly fear of making mistakes. Main themes related to facing uncertainty and found in the diaries and writings were insecurity of professional skills, own credibility, facing with the inexactness of medicine, fear of making mistakes, coping with responsibility, and tolerating oneself as incomplete and accepting oneself as a good-enough doctor-to-be. Common steps of development towards tolerance of uncertainty were found in diaries over a one-year time period as the students progressed in their clinical studies.CONCLUSIONSReflective writing showed to be an effective means for the students of both expressing and dealing with uncertainty, both with the difficult and the pleasant feelings and the experiences the students had with their first patient contacts. It also gave some of them the means of self-reflection which they afterwards found worthwhile.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONSReflective writing is powerful tool which medical students could use to facilitate their maturation process what comes to uncertainty during their first clinical year.",0,1639

However, although the need for ward round training is emphasized in the published literature, there are currently no reports of ward round training in a simulated setting with standardized patients.METHODS45 final year students participated in a ward round training session lasting two hours with three standardized patient scenarios and role-plays. Final year students assumed the role of either doctor, nurse or final year student with role-specific instructions and provided each other with peer-feedback during the training session. Training was assessed using final year student focus groups and semi-structured interviews of standardized patients. Written protocols of the focus group as well as the interviews of standardized patients were content analysed.RESULTSIn the course of five focus groups, 204 individual statements were gathered from participating final year students. Ward round training proved to be a feasible tool, well accepted by final year students. It was seen to offer a valuable opportunity for reflection on the processes of ward rounds, important relevant feedback from standardized patients, peer group and tutors. Semi-structured standardized patient interviews yielded 17 central comments indicating that ward rounds are a novel and exciting experience for standardized patients.CONCLUSIONWard round training with standardized patients is greatly appreciated by final year students and is viewed as an important part of their education, easing the transition from observing ward rounds to conducting them on their own.",0,1642

During 5 years of follow-up, we therefore investigated the efficacy and safety of PPV for BRVO and evaluated the incidence of additional treatments.METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 25 eyes of 24 patients who underwent PPV for ME associated with BRVO and were followed up for at least 5 years. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured, and foveal thickness was assessed by optical coherence tomography. Additional treatments were also investigated.RESULTSThe logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) improved from 0.53±0.23 at baseline to 0.16±0.25 at 5 years (P<0.0001). The foveal thickness decreased from 535±222 µm at baseline to 205±143 µm at 5 years (P<0.0001).

Marathon Death is an exercise conducted during the fourth year of medical school in northern Sweden to prepare students for this responsibility. The exercise is designed to enable students to gain insight into the emotional and formal procedure of delivering death notifications. The exercise is inspired by Augusto Boal's work around Forum Theatre and is analyzed using video playback. The aim of the study was to explore reflections, attitudes and ideas toward training in delivering death notifications among medical students who participate in the Marathon Death exercise based on forum play.METHODSAfter participation in the Marathon Death exercise, students completed semi-structured interviews. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using the principles of qualitative content analysis including a deductive content analysis approach with a structured matrix based on Bloom's taxonomy domains.RESULTSThe Marathon Death exercise was perceived as emotionally loaded, realistic and valuable for the future professional role as a physician. The deliverance of a death notification to the next of kin that a loved one has died was perceived as difficult. The exercise conjured emotions such as positive expectations and sheer anxiety. Students perceived participation in the exercise as an important learning experience, discovering that they had the capacity to manage such a difficult situation. The feedback from the video playback of the exercise and the feedback from fellow students and teachers enhanced the learning experience.CONCLUSIONSThe exercise, Marathon Death, based on forum play with video playback is a useful pedagogical tool that enables students to practice delivering death notification.

A professional and economic imperative to find more efficacious treatment methods has led to constructive integration. The evolutionary imperative for higher order patterns to emerge from complex dynamic relationship has led to complicit integration, and an exoteric imperative for models of psychotherapy to have application in the world at large has led to contiguous integration. The author suggests that these patterns reflect the developmental process of psychic integration and individuation, and could form a context for professional reflection and reflexivity for therapists wishing to develop a personal integrative model.

However, there is little methodological guidance about how to integrate evidence systematically from various sources in this process. Scientific evidence derived from different approaches can be difficult to integrate and the problem is compounded when attempting to include diverse, subjective input from stakeholders.OBJECTIVEThe intent of the study was to describe and appraise a systematic, sequential approach to integrate scientific evidence, expert knowledge and experience, and stakeholder involvement in the co-design and development of a complex health intervention. The development of a Web-based lifestyle intervention for people in retirement is used as an example.METHODSEvidence from three systematic reviews, qualitative research findings, and expert knowledge was compiled to produce evidence statements (stage 1). Face validity of these statements was assessed by key stakeholders in a co-design workshop resulting in a set of intervention principles (stage 2). These principles were assessed for face validity in a second workshop, resulting in core intervention concepts and hand-drawn prototypes (stage 3). The outputs from stages 1-3 were translated into a design brief and specification (stage 4), which guided the building of a functioning prototype, Web-based intervention (stage 5). This prototype was de-risked resulting in an optimized functioning prototype (stage 6), which was subject to iterative testing and optimization (stage 7), prior to formal pilot evaluation.RESULTSThe evidence statements (stage 1) highlighted the effectiveness of physical activity, dietary and social role interventions in retirement; the idiosyncratic nature of retirement and well-being; the value of using specific behavior change techniques including those derived from the Health Action Process Approach; and the need for signposting to local resources. The intervention principles (stage 2) included the need to facilitate self-reflection on available resources, personalization, and promotion of links between key lifestyle behaviors. The core concepts and hand-drawn prototypes (stage 3) had embedded in them the importance of time use and work exit planning, personalized goal setting, and acceptance of a Web-based intervention. The design brief detailed the features and modules required (stage 4), guiding the development of wireframes, module content and functionality, virtual mentors, and intervention branding (stage 5). Following an iterative process of intervention testing and optimization (stage 6), the final Web-based intervention prototype of LEAP (Living, Eating, Activity, and Planning in retirement) was produced (stage 7).

Research and theory for nursing practice 26(3","Although communicable disease public health practice has traditionally been based on numbers (e.g., incidence, prevalence), in the domain of HIV prevention and control qualitative research has recently become a more commonly employed data collection strategy. Of particular benefit, this approach can supplement the numbers which typically underpin public health strategies by generating in-depth understandings about how specific populations define, describe, and perceive their health and the factors that affect it. However, the use of qualitative research in public health must be explored; it cannot simply be accepted without reflection or analysis. To guide such an investigation, the work of Michel Foucault and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri is used to examine two previous research projects that were undertaken by the author. The outcome of this analysis is the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that although qualitative research can enhance public health work, it may also be a strategy that generates the information that can be used for capturing and normalizing marginalized populations. Qualitative research, in other words, may be a technique that can be used to achieve biopolitical goals.",0,1650

These empirical studies highlighted that while some nurses felt they should instruct clients to disclose their HIV-positive status if HIV transmission were possible, other nurses were equally adamant that such counselling was outside the nursing scope of practice. A review of these opposing perceptions about disclosure counselling, including an examination of the empirical evidence which supports each point, revealed that the dichotomous arguments needed to be nuanced. The empirical evidence about serostatus disclosure neither supported nor refuted either of these assertions; rather, it substantiated parts of each. To create this understanding, both empirical and theoretical works are used. First, the results of empirical studies about serostatus disclosure, or lack thereof and HIV transmission is presented; as part of this, Marks and Crepaz's HIV disclosure and exposure framework is examined.

Students learned about three main aspects of living with chronic conditions: beliefs about chronic conditions, managing chronic conditions, and experiencing chronic conditions, with some evidence that these themes may be interconnected. Findings suggest that learning partnerships with older adults combined with reflective journaling enable nursing students to understand the experience of chronic conditions in later life as reflected within current literature and to identify interventions for gerontological nursing practice.

These retinal abnormalities observed in Lck deficient mice lead to the loss of normal architecture of the photoreceptor and the inner nuclear layers, and provide an important role of Lck protein in the retina development. The lack of the Lck protein produces a spectrum of retinal pathology that resembles human retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).",0,1654

We develop and validate a scale to measure proactive vitality management (PVM), and explore the nomological network. We conducted a five-day diary study (N = 133; 521 days), a survey study (N = 813) and a cross-sectional study measuring daily PVM (N = 246) among working individuals from various occupational sectors. The results show that PVM can be reliably measured with eight items that load on one overall factor, both on general and daily level. Furthermore, daily PVM was moderately but positively related to the use of work-related strategies and micro-breaks. Moreover, PVM related positively to relevant personal characteristics (i.e., proactive personality and self-insight) and showed moderate but positive relationships with job crafting and relaxation (convergent validity). PVM was unrelated to psychological detachment and decreasing hindering demands (discriminant validity). Finally, PVM was positively related to well-being, in-role work performance, creative work performance and performance on the Remote Associates Test (criterion validity). We conclude that employees may promote their own work performance through the use of PVM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1655

(2016"," ""Spectrochemical analysis of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus","Terrestrial plants are ideal sentinels of environmental pollution, due to their sedentary nature, abundance and sensitivity to atmospheric changes. However, reliable and sensitive biomarkers of exposure have hitherto been difficult to characterise. Biospectroscopy offers a novel approach to the derivation of biomarkers in the form of discrete molecular alterations detectable within a biochemical fingerprint. We investigated the application of this approach for the identification of biomarkers for pollution exposure using the common sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) as a sentinel species. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to interrogate leaf tissue collected from three sites exposed to different levels of vehicle exhaust emissions. Following multivariate analysis of acquired spectra, significant biochemical alterations were detected between comparable leaves from different sites that may constitute putative biomarkers for pollution-induced stress. These included differences in carbohydrate and nucleic acid conformations, which may be indicative of sub-lethal exposure effects. We also observed several corresponding spectral alterations in both the leaves of A. pseudoplatanus exposed to ozone pollution under controlled environmental conditions and in leaves infected with the fungal pathogen Rhytisma acerinum, indicating that some stress-induced changes are conserved between different stress signatures. These similarities may be indicative of stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, although further work is needed to verify the precise identity of infrared biomarkers and to identify those that are specific to pollution exposure. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that biospectroscopy presents an effective toolkit for the utilisation of higher plants, such as A. pseudoplatanus, as sentinels of environmental pollution.",0,1656

This so-called mood-brightening (MB) effect represents a theoretical and empirical oddity. The current study is a secondary analysis investigating whether the MB effect is moderated by spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies, which have been implicated in the maintenance and modulation of NA in prior work. Participants (N = 95) representing a large spectrum of depressive symptom severity reported their experiences of NA and the occurrence of positive events in daily life over the course of seven days using the experience sampling method. Our findings replicate and build upon those of prior studies relating to the MB effect in the following ways: (1) we observed the MB effect for specific negative emotions of sadness, anger, anxiety; and (2) we found evidence that the MB effect is moderated by spontaneous use of rumination, distraction, and expressive suppression, which have been shown to enhance or dampen NA.

Part B, Cybernetics : a publication of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society 37(1","This paper proposes a new gaze-detection method based on a 3-D eye position and the gaze vector of the human eyeball. Seven new developments compared to previous works are presented. First, a method of using three camera systems, i.e., one wide-view camera and two narrow-view cameras, is proposed. The narrow-view cameras use autozooming, focusing, panning, and tilting procedures (based on the detected 3-D eye feature position) for gaze detection. This allows for natural head and eye movement by users. Second, in previous conventional gaze-detection research, one or multiple illuminators were used. These studies did not consider specular reflection (SR) problems, which were caused by the illuminators when working with users who wore glasses. To solve this problem, a method based on dual illuminators is proposed in this paper. Third, the proposed method does not require user-dependent calibration, so all procedures for detecting gaze position operate automatically without human intervention. Fourth, the intrinsic characteristics of the human eye, such as the disparity between the pupillary and the visual axes in order to obtain accurate gaze positions, are considered. Fifth, all the coordinates obtained by the left and right narrow-view cameras, as well as the wide-view camera coordinates and the monitor coordinates, are unified. This simplifies the complex 3-D converting calculation and allows for calculation of the 3-D feature position and gaze position on the monitor. Sixth, to upgrade eye-detection performance when using a wide-view camera, the adaptive-selection method is used. This involves an IR-LED on/off scheme, an AdaBoost classifier, and a principle component analysis method based on the number of SR elements. Finally, the proposed method uses an eigenvector matrix (instead of simply averaging six gaze vectors) in order to obtain a more accurate final gaze vector that can compensate for noise. Experimental results show that the root mean square error of gaze detection was about 0.627 cm on a 19-in monitor. The processing speed of the proposed method (used to obtain the gaze position on the monitor) was 32 ms (using a Pentium IV 1.8-GHz PC). It was possible to detect the user's gaze position at real-time speed.",0,1658

Objective: This article aims to present a descriptive review of Norwegian intervention research on care farms that provide rehabilitation for people with mental health disorders. Methods: This literature review applied a non-systematic search strategy: all articles in the field known to the authors were selected for inclusion. The selected studies were intervention studies that were conducted on farms in Norway, that used adult participants with mental health problems/disorders, and that reported outcome measures related to mental health. The studies and articles presented quantitative and/or qualitative data. Results: The findings from the published articles report improvements to mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, perceived stress, positive affect, rumination, and self-efficacy. Qualitative data describe a variety of positive experiences, such as improved coping ability, increased social support, and appreciation of the care farm activity. Conclusion: Participating in interventions on care farms positively influences mental health. Care farming may therefore be used as a supplementary approach in mental health rehabilitation, as it offers meaningful and engaging occupations and social inclusion.

Only two articles were empirical studies involving the collection of primary empirical data. The remaining ones were commentaries and personal reflections. While there is a near absence of empirical research about the psychosocial needs of students, several commentaries suggest that students in this field have a high need for support. Three themes were identified in the limited literature retrieved: (1) the importance of proper training and supervision; (2) the availability of emotional support structures; and (3) the use of effective and deliberate self-care strategies.SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTSThis scoping review demonstrates that little is known about the psychosocial needs of students conducting research in advanced cancer and palliative care. However, what is clear is that there is a large emotional impact on student researchers engaged in this type of work.

There is a need for studies that address conditions of risk and protection for the development of such problems. This study aimed to verify the rates of burnout, anxiety, and depression presented by resident physicians, as well as the associations of these problems with social skills, as potential protective factors. The hypothesis was defined that the problems (burnout, anxiety, and depression) would be negatively associated with social skills. A total of 305 medical residents, of both genders, of different specialties, from clinical and surgical areas of a Brazilian university hospital were evaluated using the following standardized self-report instruments: Burnout Syndrome Inventory, Social Skills Inventory, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. High rates of burnout and mental health problems were verified and social skills were negatively associated with burnout dimensions such as emotional exhaustion, emotional detachment, and dehumanization, but positively associated with personal accomplishment. Furthermore, residents with indicators of problems presented significantly lower social skills means than those of residents without indicators of burnout, anxiety, or depression. More studies are needed, which include other types of instruments in addition to self-report ones and evaluate not only social skills but also social competence in the professional practice. These should adopt intervention and longitudinal designs that allow the continuity or overcoming of the problems to be verified. Since social skills can be learned, the results of the study highlight the importance of developing the interpersonal skills of the professionals during the training of resident physicians in order to improve their practice.

As the author examined the authors' description of the Pyramid, he noticed that Wooden did not include any specific skills. Instead, each component of the pyramid is an attitude or personal characteristic representative of an effective leader. It appears that Wooden believed that coaching effectiveness was based on an individual's ability to model these positive characteristics while creating a mastery driven learning environment. Nonetheless, if Wooden's Pyramid of Success is correct, then it may be time to place equal emphasis on the art of coaching by providing more opportunities for applied work and reflection on those experiences.

The present book Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression is the second edition of an earlier work and provides an extensive account of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) including theory, applications, and research. MBCT is designed as a form of relapse prevention for individuals who have successfully overcome one or more depressive episodes and combines elements of cognitive therapy with meditation and mindfulness practices in a classroom-style format. The overall aim is to help individuals relate to thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations associated with depressive relapse in different ways. Based on the theory that depressive relapse occurs when sad moods or other difficult emotions trigger ruminative and self-perpetuating states of mind that then create a depressive episode, principles of mindfulness and cognitive therapy are used to help disengage from these processes and promote greater acceptance and tolerability of all inner emotions and experiences. This book is highly recommended for students and mental health professionals who are interested in mindfulness, depression, or relapse prevention.

Second, I propose that the rACC plays a key role in treatment outcome because of its ‘hub’ position in the default network. Specifically, I hypothesize that elevated resting rACC activity confers better treatment outcomes by fostering adaptive self-referential processing and by helping to recalibrate relationships between the default network and a ‘task-positive network’ that comprises dorsolateral prefrontal and dorsal cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control. Third, I support this hypothesis by reviewing neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging data on frontocingulate dysfunction in depression.

In this study, we investigated whether this program is also beneficial for younger children with ASD, whether effects last on the long-term, and whether it reduces common comorbid problems. Forty-five children referred with ASD aged 8 until 19 years old, and their parents participated. Repeated measures of children’s and parents’ social communication problems, emotional and behavioral functioning, mindful awareness, and of parenting were conducted pre-intervention, post intervention, 2-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up. While children did not report significant changes in mindful awareness, their social communication problems decreased, and their emotional and behavioral functioning improved. Results were not consistent at each occasion; improvements reported by children were most substantial at a 2-month follow-up and only partly remained at a 1-year follow-up, while all children’s improvements as reported by parents were present on all occasions. Parents themselves reported improved emotional and behavioral functioning, improved parenting, and increased mindful awareness on all occasions. Parents’ social communication problems reduced only directly after the intervention. Most improvements were supported by the qualitative investigation of children’s and parents’ experienced change as reported on open-ended questions. This study suggests that children, including adolescents, with ASD and their parents can benefit from a mindfulness-based program with parallel sessions for children and parents.

But to what extent is this competency addressed during the student's clinical year? The objective of this study was to determine the perception of importance of team skills in the medical technologist curriculum as well as to explore methods and approaches used to teach team skills during the course of clinical training. Information was collected from medical laboratory educators via an electronic survey. A majority of respondents (64%) ranked the development of team skills as either very important or important and 69% reported that they have incorporated team-based projects into their curriculum using a variety of different assignments. For maximum learning and skill development, it is essential that educators structure the assignment to ensure individual and group accountability, to facilitate the group process when necessary, and to provide a mechanism for review and reflection.",0,1684

Faircloth (eds) (2006). The academic study of 'masculinity' has burgeoned over the last 25 years. During the same period, the sociological concept of 'medicalisation' has been developed and deployed to explore the role that medicine and the health professions play as agents of social control. Despite this, there has been very little work that has brought these two fields together. The developing field of 'men's health' has tended to focus its work on epidemiological, sex-difference data, men's experiences of chronic ill-health, and how societal demands construct men as 'risk takers' and the concomitant impact of this on health outcomes. With this context in mind, the explicit aims of this edited text are twofold: first, to account for the current gap in the literature on the medicalisation of masculinity and male bodies; second, to provide, through the use of empirical studies and historiographies, emerging work that begins to address this gap. The book's chapters cover a range of topic areas in order to explore specific examples of how, when, and where, the medicalisation of masculinities can be elucidated. The first two of these are empirical chapters that focus on the development and marketing of medications used to 'treat' erectile dysfunction and show how masculine stereotypes are utilised and reproduced, but also challenged and reframed, within this process. The remaining chapters are historiographies that cover four areas. First, the medicalisation of ageing men's bodies using examples of the construction of an 'andropause' and the pathologising of 'baldness'. Second, an exploration of gender bias in medical anatomy and the apparent contradiction when men's bodies have been used to represent the 'norm', yet this medicalisation of men's bodies has often been hidden under a 'cloak of neutrality and dispassionate detachment' (p. 131). Third, the way that male infant and child behaviour has become pathologised as 'Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder' and the role that mothers and teachers (as well as health professions and pharmaceutical companies) play in this process. Finally, through considering the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment, an exploration of the historical sexualisation and medicalisation of black male bodies is provided.

Nurse education today 68: 159-164.","INTRODUCTIONThe bachelor thesis, a final year subject to obtain a nursing degree, presents an ideal opportunity for the development and assessment of professional competencies. Thus, it is necessary to specify that the structure of the bachelor thesis works as an element of review and reflection from both a pedagogical and professional perspective.OBJECTIVETo analyse the main elements of the bachelor thesis in the nursing degree 2015-16 in Spain.METHODOLOGYA transversal descriptive study was conducted using a quantitative documentary analysis via study guides or grade reports. The variables were the main academic elements of the bachelor thesis subject (credits, competencies, learning outcomes, contents, methodologies, training activities and assessment). A probabilistic sample of 66 institutions was studied using descriptive statistics with statistical measures of central tendency and measures of variability.RESULTSThe results showed a maximum range of 12 and a minimum of 6 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System. The definition and number of competencies to be developed varied and the learning outcomes were formulated in only 40.9% of the guides consulted. The most widely used teaching methodologies and training activities were academic supervision (87.9%) and autonomous work (80.3%). Regarding types of work, basic investigation (34.8%), care plans (33.3%) and literature review (30,3%) ranked highest. No specific descriptors could be linked to the contents. Finally, two main assessment tools were found: process and product. The rubric is presented as a main element of the assessment.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSThe bachelor thesis is conceived as autonomous, personal and original academic work. But no homogeneity was observed in the key development elements such as competencies, teaching strategies, or type of bachelor thesis.

Journal of veterinary medical education 44(2","Metacognition is the act of thinking about one's own thought processes. There are long-term gains in learning among students who are trained to understand how the brain works and how they can control their own learning. Wrappers are short questionnaires provided at or near the time of completion of a lecture, assignment, or assessment to coach the student in thinking through the steps of metacognition (planning, monitoring, and adapting). As students completed the second and third of four examinations in a first-year veterinary anatomy course, they were invited to fill out an examination wrapper that asked them questions about examination preparation, where they felt they had had the most trouble with the examination, and what they might do differently before the next examination. Neither percentage change in scores from the second to the third and from the third to the fourth lecture or laboratory examination nor final grade for the course varied between the group of students who completed an examination wrapper and the group that did not. Students did not appear to change their behavior from one examination to the next. This was most likely because students lacked formal training in metacognition and therefore did not understand the value of completing the examination wrapper or the potential benefits of using their reflections. Future work will describe outcomes when learning objectives specific to metacognition are included in coursework in the veterinary curriculum.",0,1687

The 12 MCH leadership competencies were used to guide the coding of the comments for this qualitative, directed content analysis.RESULTSForty-six of 58 students (79.3%) from two consecutive cohorts responded for this cross-sectional study. Interactions with self-advocates prompted comments on 8 of the 12 leadership competencies, including interdisciplinary team building (29% of the comments); developing others through teaching and mentoring (22%); and self-reflection (18%).CONCLUSIONSThe inclusion of self-advocates throughout an interdisciplinary leadership development program for graduate students in health affairs can strengthen MCH leadership competencies for all participants as they enter an increasingly interdisciplinary workforce.",0,1688

Health & Social Care in the Community.","In recent decades, a considerable amount of literature on interdisciplinary collaboration has been published. Interdisciplinary collaboration plays an important role in matching services to the individual needs of children and young people, but working interdisciplinary appears to be hard for youth social work professionals. The aim of this scoping review was to identify, analyse, and summarise literature on stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration among social work professionals working with youth. Seven databases were systematically searched (until March 2017), and grey literature was hand-searched for relevant publications. Included in this review were empirical studies on at least one (future) social work professional working with youth that (a) focused on interventions for or important elements in interdisciplinary collaboration, team development, or teambuilding/work, (b) were conducted in a Western country; (c) met a clearly written method, and (d) were published in English or Dutch. Eighteen publications met the criteria, in which two categories of studies could be identified: focusing on important elements in interdisciplinary collaboration (ten studies) and focusing on interventions (eight studies). From the ten studies on elements, six overarching elements were distinguished that appear to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration. (a) Awareness and understanding of the other discipline; (b) communication and interaction: feedback, reflection, and evaluation; (c) team structure; (d) willingness to work together; (e) shared responsibility/norms, and (f) mutual trust. The interventions found in the eight other studies were divided into three forms: training, organisational interventions, and tools. More support for professionals in interventions is needed to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration. The six overarching elements found in this review can be used in developing these interventions.

Gold Foundation Humanism in Medicine Essay Contest in 1999 (n = 50) and 2013 (n = 60) in response to the prompt, ""Who is the good doctor?""RESULTSThe authors identified five relational themes as guiding the day-to-day work and lives of physicians: doctor-patient, doctor-self, doctor-learner, doctor-colleague, and doctor-system/society/profession. The authors noted a highly similar distribution of primary and secondary relational themes for essays from 1999 and 2013. The majority of the essays emphasized the centrality of the doctor-patient relationship. Student essays focused little on teamwork, systems innovation, or technology use-all important developments in contemporary medicine.CONCLUSIONSMedical students' narrative reflections are increasingly used as rich sources of information about the lived experience of medical education.

In the present work, we investigated how EGCG suppresses cell adhesion by comparing the adhesion of human pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1 and BxPC-3) and their counterpart, normal human embryonic pancreas-derived cells (1C3D3), in catechin-containing media using organosilane monolayer templates (OMTs). The purpose of this work is (1) to evaluate the quantitativeness in the measurement of cell adhesion with the OMT and (2) to show how green-tea catechins suppress cell adhesion in a cancer-specific manner. For the first purpose, the adhesion of cancer and normal cells was compared using the OMT. The cell adhesion in different type of catechins such as EGCG, (-)-Epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG) and (-)-Epicatechin (EC) was also evaluated. The measurements revealed that the anti-adhesion effect of green-tea catechins is cancer-specific, and the order is EGCG≫ECG>EC. The results agree well with the data reported to date, showing the quantitativeness of the new method. For the second purpose, the contact area of cells on the OMT was measured by reflection interference contrast microscopy. The cell-OMT contact area of cancer cells decreases with increasing EGCG concentration, whereas that of normal cells remains constant. The results reveal a twofold action of EGCG on cancer cell adhesion-suppressing cell attachment to a candidate adhesion site and decreasing the contact area of the cells-and validates the use of OMT as a tool for screening cancer cell adhesion.",0,1695

Design: Second-generation HIV sentinel surveillance surveys conducted in 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. Methods: Adult men reporting sex with at least 1 man during the previous year were eligible to participate. Sexual behavior and serum HIV-1 and syphilis antibodies were assessed. HIV seroincidence was estimated by a sensitive/less-sensitive enzyme immunoassay strategy. Rectal and pharyngeal swabs for Neisseria gonorrhoeae culture and a first-void urine sample for urethral leukocytes for presumptive diagnosis of urethritis were obtained. Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) antibodies were measured in 2002. Results: Although HIV prevalence increased from 18.5% to 22.3% from 1996 through 2002, bacterial prevalence declined significantly for syphilis (16.0% to 12.4%), early syphilis (8.6% to 3.4%), and rectal gonorrhea (5.1% to 0.2%). High HIV seroincidence was estimated, with the lowest (4.8%) incidence in 1998. In 2002, HSV-2 seroprevalence was 51.0%. After adjustment for age, education, and self-reported sexual identity, our data suggest that a yearly increase by 6% in the prevalence of HIV occurred among MSM in Lima, with a corresponding decline in syphilis (by 9%), early syphilis (by 18%), and rectal gonorrhea (by 64%). Condom use during last sexual intercourse increased by 26% each year with the most recent male steady partner and, among non-sex workers, by 11% with the most recent casual partner. Conclusions: HIV continued to spread among MSM in Lima even when a decline in bacterial STIs and increase in condom use were estimated to occur.

Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been suggested as a biopesticide for M. domestica but a phenotypic response due to the induction of the RNAi pathway has not been demonstrated in adults. In this study female house flies were injected with dsRNA targeting actin-5C or ribosomal protein (RP) transcripts RPL26 and RPS6. Ovaries showed highly reduced provisioning and clutch reductions of 94-99% in RP dsRNA treated flies but not in actin-5C or GFP treated flies. Gene expression levels were significantly and specifically reduced in dsRNA injected groups but remained unchanged in the control dsGFP treated group. Furthermore, injections with an Aedes aegypti conspecific dsRNA designed against RPS6 did not impact fecundity, demonstrating species specificity of the RNAi response. Analysis of M. domestica tissues following RPS6 dsRNA injection showed significant reduction of transcript levels in the head, thorax, and abdomen but increased expression in ovarian tissues.

Although the benefits of collaborative learning have long been recognized, it is still rarely studied by social network analysis (SNA) in medical education, and the relationship of parameters that can be obtained via SNA with students' performance remains largely unknown. The aim of this work was to assess the potential of SNA for studying online collaborative clinical case discussions in a medical course and to find out which activities correlate with better performance and help predict final grade or explain variance in performance.METHODSInteraction data were extracted from the learning management system (LMS) forum module of the Surgery course in Qassim University, College of Medicine. The data were analyzed using social network analysis. The analysis included visual as well as a statistical analysis. Correlation with students' performance was calculated, and automatic linear regression was used to predict students' performance.RESULTSBy using social network analysis, we were able to analyze a large number of interactions in online collaborative discussions and gain an overall insight of the course social structure, track the knowledge flow and the interaction patterns, as well as identify the active participants and the prominent discussion moderators. When augmented with calculated network parameters, SNA offered an accurate view of the course network, each user's position, and level of connectedness. Results from correlation coefficients, linear regression, and logistic regression indicated that a student's position and role in information relay in online case discussions, combined with the strength of that student's network (social capital), can be used as predictors of performance in relevant settings.CONCLUSIONBy using social network analysis, researchers can analyze the social structure of an online course and reveal important information about students' and teachers' interactions that can be valuable in guiding teachers, improve students' engagement, and contribute to learning analytics insights.",0,1701

The major limitation on the accuracy of the structure-factor measurements is uncertainty in the Debye-Waller factors describing the temperature-dependent atomic vibrations. While X-ray and neutron diffraction tech-niques are both capable of accurate measurements of Debye-Waller factors, the frequent use of liquid-nitrogen-cooled samples in CBED experiments means that previous measurements are rarely available at the temperatures required.

Clinical & experimental ophthalmology 42(7","BACKGROUNDCurrent surgical techniques for retinal prosthetic implantation require long and complicated surgery, which can increase the risk of complications and adverse outcomes.METHODThe suprachoroidal position is known to be an easier location to access surgically, and so this study aimed to develop a surgical procedure for implanting a prototype suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis. The array implantation procedure was developed in 14 enucleated eyes. A full-thickness scleral incision was made parallel to the intermuscular septum and superotemporal to the lateral rectus muscle. A pocket was created in the suprachoroidal space, and the moulded electrode array was inserted. The scleral incision was closed and scleral anchor point sutured. In 9 of the 14 eyes examined, the device insertion was obstructed by the posterior ciliary neurovascular bundle. Subsequently, the position of this neurovascular bundle in 10 eyes was characterized. Implantation and lead routing procedure was then developed in six human cadavers. The array was tunnelled forward from behind the pinna to the orbit. Next, a lateral canthotomy was made. Lead fixation was established by creating an orbitotomy drilled in the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. The lateral rectus muscle was detached, and implantation was carried out. Finally, pinna to lateral canthus measurements were taken on 61 patients in order to determine optimal lead length.RESULTSThese results identified potential anatomical obstructions and informed the anatomical fitting of the suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.CONCLUSIONAs a result of this work, a straightforward surgical approach for accurate anatomical suprachoroidal array and lead placement was developed for clinical application.",0,1705

Ocular trauma with retained foreign body is an important cause of visual impairment in working-age population. Clinical status impacts on the timing and planning of surgery. In the last year small gauge vitrectomy has become safer and more efficient, extending the range of pathologies successfully treated. Aims. To evaluate the safety and outcomes in patients with open eye injury with retained foreign body that underwent early 25-gauge vitrectomy. Methods. In this retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series, we performed 25-gauge vitrectomy on 10 patients affected by open globe injuries with retained foreign body, over 3 years. We analyzed age, wound site, foreign body characteristics, ocular lesions correlated, relative afferent pupillary defect, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months. According to the clinical status we performed other procedures to manage ocular correlated lesions. Results. The median age of patients was 37 years. The foreign body median size was 3.5 mm (size range, 1 to 10 mm). 25-gauge vitrectomy was performed within 12 hours of trauma. Foreign body removal occurred via a clear corneal or scleral tunnel incision or linear pars plana scleral access. Visual acuity improved in all patients. Endophthalmitis was never reported. Only two cases reported postoperative ocular hypertension resolved within the follow-up. Retinal detachment recurred in one case only. Conclusions. 25-gauge vitrectomy could be considered as early approach to manage open globe injuries with a retained posterior segment foreign body in selected cases with good outcomes and low complication rate.",0,1706

Journal of medical case reports 11(1","BACKGROUNDProliferative diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of visual impairment in working-age adults worldwide. Panretinal photocoagulation is a cornerstone in its management; however, it may include a range of side effects and complications, one of these being serous retinal detachment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab for serous retinal detachment after panretinal photocoagulation.CASE PRESENTATIONA 24-year-old Saudi man with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes presented with bilateral progressive proliferative retinopathy in spite of several sessions of panretinal photocoagulation. After one additional such session, he developed bilateral serous retinal detachment and vision loss, which was managed with a single bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab injection. The serous retinal detachment subsided with partial recovery of vision.CONCLUSIONSSerous retinal detachment after panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a rare complication nowadays. In this case, it seems that excessive photocoagulation exceeded the energy-absorbing capacity of the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to a disruption of the blood-retinal barrier. A single injection of bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab was sufficient to control the serous retinal detachment. This effect may have been due to a reduction of vascular leakage resulting from the mechanism of action of this drug. No complications were noted from the injection. Caution should be exerted when attempting bilateral panretinal photocoagulation.",0,1707
1708,"Schmidsberger, F. and H. Loffler-Stastka (2018"," ""Empathy is proprioceptive: the bodily fundament of empathy - a philosophical contribution to medical education."" BMC Med Educ 18(1","BACKGROUND: The current philosophical debate on empathy entails accounts of theory of mind and simulation as well as a phenomenological opposition. The first focuses on a detached observation of others from a 3rd person perspective and formulates the common claim that there is no direct access to the mental and emotional life of others, only simulation or analogy can grant access to the emotions and behaviour of others. The philosophical respectively phenomenological account of Fuchs instead opposes by focusing personal interaction within a 1st or 2nd person perspective claiming that the emotions of others are experienceable through bodily expression and bodily resonance. Fuchs offers an account of embodied affectivity that emphasizes the role of the (subjective) body for emotion and empathy. By experiencing the bodily expressed emotions of a vis-a-vis with and through the own body empathy and social understanding are bodily grounded. Following this core thesis Fuchs differentiates a primary, bodily empathy and an extended empathy that focuses on putting myself in the shoes of others (perspective taking). DISCUSSION: By comparison of different forms of social understanding as discussed in the phenomenological tradition - like contagion, sharing and empathy - it can be shown that extended empathy has an egocentric character. By putting myself in the shoes of others I miss a person's otherness that transcends my capacity of imagination respectively the personal frame of my experience. Further Fuchs' disregards that a bodily based empathy is co-structured by higher level form of understanding like contextual biographic knowledge. CONCLUSION: The philosophical discussion offers fertile impulses for Medical Education (ME) and the training of empathic communication skills. The account of Fuchs highlights the role of bodily perception (proprioception) as a resource of understanding others. Thus proprioceptive skills of a physician can support the empathic understanding of the physician. The objection against the egocentric trait of perspective taking admonishes not to generalize the own perspective as decisive for empathy and to adopt an attitude that remains open to the otherness of a patient and its experiences.",0,1708

It links the photon's path-length fraction f in the liquid phase to the liquid fraction epsilon. We then construct two-dimensional Voronoi foams, replace the cell edges by channels to represent the liquid films and simulate photon paths according to the laws of ray optics using transmission and reflection coefficients from Fresnel's formulas. In an exact honeycomb foam, the photons show superdiffusive behavior. It becomes diffusive as soon as disorder is introduced into the foams. The dependence of the diffusion constant on channel width and refractive index is explained by a one-dimensional random-walk model. It contains a photon channelling state that is crucial for the understanding of the numerical results. At the end, we shortly comment on the observation that photon channelling only occurs in a finite range of epsilon.",0,1709

The searches identified 216 unique citations, and 49 articles of possible clinical relevance were reviewed in full text. Of these 49 articles, 27 were deemed sufficiently relevant or of interest, and they were rated according to strength of evidence. An additional 6 articles were identified from the reference lists of these articles and included. All 33 studies were retrospective.RESULTSPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of aqueous or vitreous humor was positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 79% to 100% of cases of suspected ARN. Aqueous and vitreous specimens are both sensitive and specific. There is level II and III evidence supporting the use of intravenous and oral antiviral therapy for the treatment of ARN. Data suggest that equivalent plasma drug levels of acyclovir can be achieved after administration of oral valacyclovir or intravenous acyclovir.

Cognition and Emotion 27(2","This work uses self-discrepancies as a unifying framework to understand the relationship between autobiographical memory specificity (AMS) and components of rumination (reflection and brooding). Rumination can be triggered by the awareness of a discrepancy between one’s current state of being and one’s desired state of being. Such discrepancies may partly underlie the phenomenon of reduced AMS (a.k.a. overgeneral memory), which is a phenomenon of great clinical importance especially for depression. The aim of the present studies was to experimentally investigate the impact of a self-discrepancy manipulation on AMS in a student sample (Study 1) and in a depressed sample (Study 2). Results failed to reveal a direct effect of a self-discrepancy manipulation on AMS, but in both studies, actual ideal discrepancies interacted with the reflection component of rumination with respect to memory specificity. In the self-discrepancy condition, there was a negative association between reflection and change in AMS: Higher reflection was associated with a greater decrease in AMS from pre- to post-testing. The results of these two studies suggest that the interplay between components of rumination and self-discrepancy has an effect on memory specificity.

Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society 103: 457-472.","PURPOSEIn colobomatous eyes, the risk of retinal detachment increases with age. This study elucidates the anatomic conditions and pathologic process of retinal detachment associated with colobomas.METHODSThe records, including histologic slides, of 14 children (1 day to 17 months old) and 7 adults (17 to 78 years old) with colobomas were examined.RESULTSIn children, colobomas were associated with lethal malformations. The extracolobomatous inner retinal layers extended centrally, forming the intercalary membrane. Duplication of the outer retinal layers and a horizontal shift of Müllerian glia created a triangle and a locus minoris resistentiae adjacent to the laterally displaced pigment epithelium. Part of the locus was an incomplete layer of photoreceptors excluding Müllerian glia. In adults, atrophy of the intercalary membrane, manifested as central schisis, thinning of the neuroepithelium, and hole formation, was related to a paucity of blood vessels within and underneath the intercalary membrane and the size of colobomas. The margins featured blood vessels, pigment epithelial hypertrophy, and choroidal and scleral thickening in a compact, intertwined arrangement.CONCLUSIONSGlial atrophy, schisis, and hole formation in the intercalary membrane and separation of the locus minoris resistentiae from the pigment epithelium can disrupt barriers to fluid flow and set the stage for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. That process is exacerbated by scleral ectasia, increasing vitreous traction at the margin, and retinovascular ischemia within the intercalary membrane. A vascularized, compact margin resembling a laser barrier, found predominantly in adults, may protect against retinal detachment.",0,1713

International Journal of Stress Management.","A recent extension of the stressor–detachment model holds that the path running from job stressors via psychological detachment to impairment of well-being is moderated by both personal and job resources (Sonnentag & Fritz, 2015). The aim of the present study was to test this proposition by investigating the moderating role of one personal resource and one job resource (i.e., coworker social support and general self-efficacy, respectively) on the linkage between different job stressors (i.e., workload and role ambiguity), detachment, and well-being. Hypotheses were tested with structural equation modeling using data from a representative survey of the German workforce (N = 3,937 employees, Mage = 46.5 years, 47.5% women). In agreement with previous findings, the results showed that psychological detachment mediated the negative effects of job stressors on well-being. Social support from coworkers buffered the mediation such that the conditional indirect effects of workload and role ambiguity on well-being via detachment were weaker at higher levels of support. General self-efficacy did not moderate the stressor–well-being linkage. These results imply that social support can be considered as a protective factor that helps employees maintain their well-being by alleviating the negative effects of job stressors on their ability to switch off mentally from work.

Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie 242(8","Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is the consequence of changes in the macromolecular structure of gel vitreous that result in liquefaction, concurrent with alterations in the extracellular matrix at the vitro-retinal interface that allow the posterior vitreous cortex to detach from the internal limiting lamina of the retina. Gel liquefaction that exceeds the degree of vitro-retinal dehiscence results in anomalous PVD (APVD). APVD varies in its clinical manifestations depending upon where in the fundus vitreo-retinal adhesion is strongest. At the periphery, APVD results in retinal tears and detachments. In the macula, APVD causes vitreo-macular traction syndrome, results in vitreoeschisis with macular pucker or macular holes, or contributes to some cases of diabetic macular edema. At the optic disc and retina, APVD causes vitreo-papillary traction and promotes retinal and optic disc neovascularization. Unifying the spectrum of vitreo-retinal diseases into the conceptual frame-work of APVD underscores that to more effectively treat, and ultimately prevent, these disorders it is necessary to replicate the two components of an innocuous PVD, i.e., gel liquefaction and vitreo-retinal dehiscence. Pharmacologic vitreolysis is designed to mitigate against APVD by chemically breaking down vitreous macromolecules and weakening vitro-retinal adhesion to safely detach the posterior vitreous cortex. This would not only facilitate surgery, but if performed early in the natural history of disease, it should prevent progressive disease.",0,1715

The spectra display well-resolved, distinct peaks that are consistent with complexes where the hexachloroplatinate dianion is largely intact. Adiabatic electron detachment energies for the hexachloroplatinate-nucleobase complexes are measured as 2.26-2.36 eV. The magnitudes of the repulsive Coulomb barriers (RCBs) of the complexes are all ∼1.7 eV, values that are lower than the RCB of the uncomplexed PtCl6 (2-) dianion as a result of charge solvation by the nucleobases. In addition to the resolved spectral features, broad featureless bands indicative of delayed electron detachment are observed in the 193 nm photoelectron spectra of the four clusters. The 266 nm spectra of the PtCl6 (2-) ⋅ thymine and PtCl6 (2-) ⋅ adenine complexes also display very prominent delayed electron emission bands. These results mirror recent results on the related Pt(CN)4 (2-) ⋅ nucleobase complexes [A. Sen et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 119, 11626 (2015)]. The observation of delayed electron emission bands in the PtCl6 (2-) ⋅ nucleobase spectra obtained in this work, as for the previously studied Pt(CN)4 (2-) ⋅ nucleobase complexes, is attributed to one-photon excitation of nucleobase-centred excited states that can effectively couple to the electron detachment continuum, producing strong electron detachment. Moreover, the selective, strong excitation of the delayed emission bands in the 266 nm spectra is linked to fundamental differences in the individual nucleobase photophysics at this excitation energy. This strongly supports our previous suggestion that the dianion within these clusters can be viewed as a ""dynamic tag"" which has the propensity to emit electrons when the attached nucleobase decays over a time scale long enough to allow autodetachment.",0,1719

Therefore, the temperature of a solution can be predicted by using the model and NIR spectrum. Furthermore, it was also found that the difference between the predicted results of different solutions is a quantitative reflection of concentration. The variation of intercept in the relationship of the predicted and measured temperature can be used to determine the concentration of the compositions.

Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of metacognitive methods combined with habit reversal (MCT/HRT) in trichotillomania with a relatively long-term follow-up. Method: A case series (n = 8) and a randomized wait-list controlled trial (n = 34) design were conducted in this study. In the case series, three of the eight patients dropped out of the study. Therefore, TTM-related symptoms were evaluated in five patients suffering from TTM before and after brief metacognitive plus habit reversal therapy during 1-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups. The treatment consisted of detached mindfulness (DM) techniques, ritual postponement and habit reversal training (HRT) in eight sessions. Results: All patients were responders at post-treatment in case series. After the 12-month follow-up, the results were associated with higher pre-treatment levels of self-esteem and global functioning and lower pre-treatment levels of depression and anxiety with nearly complete abstinence from hair pulling immediately after treatment. A randomized wait-list controlled trial with experimental (n = 17) and waiting list group (n = 17) was then conducted to confirm the case series results. There were significant differences between the two groups regarding changes in MGH-HPS, Y-BOCS-TM, RSES, GAF, BDI, BAI and self-monitoring.

Believing that the best time to educate professionals about this valuable health worker and ensure that CHWs become part of interdisciplinary health care teams is during the student years, the Hunter College Schools of the Health Professions, and the Community Health Worker Network of New York City developed a pilot project, the Community Health Worker Cultural Mentoring Project. Community Health Workers, who were members of the Network, served as ""community mentors"" for health professions students drawn from the programs of community health education, nursing, and nutrition. CHWs worked with faculty of selected courses in each of the professional programs, and served as panelists in these courses, presenting information about health beliefs and alternative health practices of diverse cultural groups in communities of New York City. Class sessions were first held in the fall of 2004; subsequent sessions were held in following semesters. Approximately 40 students participated in 7 classes, with 6 CHWs serving as mentors - two per class. At the end of the classroom presentations, students wrote reflections relating to their understanding of the CHW role and relevance for their future interdisciplinary practice. The majority of reflections met the goal of increasing professional students' understanding of the CHW role and skills. At this point, quantitative and qualitative data will need to be collected to verify the benefits of CHWs serving as cultural mentors, in order to determine the value of such panels being incorporated into health professions' education programs.",0,1726

Retinal cases & brief reports 4(4","PURPOSEWe report the management of a young woman with preeclampsia of pregnancy who developed bilateral Purtscher-like retinopathy and serous retinal detachment subsequently complicated by macular hole and tractional retinal detachment.METHODSThe best-corrected visual acuity was 20/1000 bilaterally. Fundus examination showed a picture of Purtscher-like retinopathy bilaterally and a macular hole in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography showed areas of capillary dropout and Elschnig spots bilaterally. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the macular hole in the right eye and a shallow serous retinal detachment bilaterally. Systemic and laboratory workup was unremarkable. Triamcinolone acetonide (4 mg/0.1 mL) was injected intravitreally in the left eye; vitrectomy was advised for the right eye. However, when the patient returned after 4 months, the right eye had developed a macular tractional retinal detachment. Vitrectomy, membrane peeling, and gas tamponade were performed.RESULTSWhen the patient returned 4 months after the intravitreal injection in the left eye, best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/40 with complete resolution of serous retinal detachment in that eye. Best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye remained at 20/1000 but with anatomic deterioration. One month after vitrectomy for the macular hole and tractional retinal detachment in the right eye, best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/240 with normalizing foveal contours. Status quo was observed in both eyes for the next 8 months. Final best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye.CONCLUSIONAn unusual combination of Purtscher-like retinopathy with serous retinal detachment in preeclampsia of pregnancy and its complication-macular hole with tractional retinal detachment-were managed by surgery and pharmacotherapy.",0,1727

Clinical Psychological Science 2(4","Treatments for severe depression have moderate success rates, often take many weeks to yield responses, and are often followed by relapse or recurrence. Neurobehavioral interventions address these limitations by targeting mechanisms of cognitive and emotional dysregulation directly. This study extends data and observations from a pilot study examining effects of 2 weeks (6 sessions) of adjunctive cognitive control training exercises added to medication and psychotherapy in severely depressed patients. We examined acute effects and predictors of change in rumination, and long-term effects on service utilization. Compared with treatment as usual, exercises were associated with decreases in rumination and decreased use of intensive outpatient services in the following year. Responses were strongest among patients who displayed physiological indicators (pupillary oscillations at the task frequency) of task engagement before the intervention. These indices changed following intervention, suggesting that the intervention required capitalization on relevant attentional mechanisms and addressed fundamental emotional processes through their cognitive substrates.

Nurse education today 45: 132-137.","UNLABELLEDIn accordance with the principles of the European Higher Education Area, the aim of this study was to contribute to the implementation of self-assessment through the application of reflection on learning and critical thinking. The theoretical framework employed was Habermas's critical theory and emancipatory interest as a preliminary step to generate educational transformations. The methodological contribution is the design a student self-assessment document that promotes reflection on action and critical thinking.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe development of assessment through peer evaluation and other intermediate solutions until achieving self-assessment entails a shift in the educational and scientific paradigm, but also involves the implementation in practice of democratic and ethical principles, values and premises in society. Self-assessment is a novel concept for students, and obliges them to reinterpret their role. Due to the diversity of students' principles, values, motivations, interests and aspirations, this reinterpretation of their role can have a positive outcome, stimulating an active and critical attitude towards group work and self-assessment; or, on the contrary, can generate a stance characterised by disinterest, passivity and lack of critical thinking.CONCLUSIONSThe forms of assessment adopted in a given educational system reflect ways of thinking related to ideologies, values, ethical principles and educational paradigms: in order to render implementation of effective self-assessment feasible, it is necessary to undertake structural and regulatory reforms. Students have little experience of reflection on practice or critical thinking. Massification and cultural and structural factors determine the form of assessment. In this context, it would seem advisable to move towards self-assessment gradually and cautiously.",0,1729

Psychological Assessment 28(5","Like other self-conscious emotions, shame takes on particular significance during late childhood and adolescence because of a developing capacity for self-reflection, self-other comparisons, and sensitivity to the views of others. Shame is a potentially important variable in adolescent well-being given its established associations with depression, reduced feelings of self-worth, and problematic anger. Three studies are reported that describe the development and validation of the Adolescent Shame-Proneness Scale (ASPS), a novel semi-idiographic measure of shame-proneness. The ASPS is a 19-item measure assessing 3 components of shame-proneness-negative self-evaluation, externalization, and emotional discomfort. Taken together, the studies support the reliability and validity of the ASPS as a semi-idiographic measure of shame-proneness in adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. ASPS scores correlate as expected with scores on existing measure of shame-proneness and with measures of anger, negative affect, and self-esteem. More important, the data suggest that ASPS scores are related to, but distinct from, guilt. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the ASPS factor structure (RMSEA = .08, SRMR = .05, CFI = .97, NNFI = .97). The ASPS represents a unique contribution to existing options for measuring shame-proneness in research and clinical contexts. Further work is required to assess the ASPS' temporal stability and its viability and psychometric properties in more culturally diverse samples. (PsycINFO Database Record",0,1732

Journal of Youth and Adolescence 47(5","During adolescence, one's status among peers is a major concern. Such status is often largely a function of popularity and establishing oneself as 'cool.' While there are conventional avenues to achieving status among adolescents, engaging in adult-like, or pseudomature, behaviors such as substance use or sexual activity is a frequent occurrence. Although past research has examined the consequences of adolescent delinquency, what remains unclear is the long-term fate of adolescents who are both popular and antisocial. Using data from a sample of African American males (N = 339) we employ latent class analysis to examine the adult consequences of achieving popularity during adolescence by engaging in pseudomature behavior. Our results identified four classes of adolescents: the conventionals, the pseudomatures, the delinquents, and the detached. The conventionals were low on popularity, pseudomature behavior, and affiliation with deviant peers but high on academic commitment. The pseudomatures were high on popularity, adult-like behavior, and academic commitment but low on affiliation with delinquent peers. The delinquents were low on popularity and school achievement but high on pseudomature behavior and affiliations with delinquent peers. Finally, the detached were low on school commitment, popularity and pseudomature behavior but they report high involvement with a delinquent peer group. By early adulthood, the costs of adolescent adult-like behavior were evident. Early popularity and academic commitment did not portend later social competence or college completion for the pseudomatures. Instead, they frequently experienced an early transition to parenthood, a likely consequence of precocious sexual activity. These findings suggest that interventions should not focus only on the most delinquent adolescents but also need to attend to the pseudomature students who are brimming with promise but are flirting with behaviors that may subvert realization of this potential.

The caring perspective on IBD is now changing to adapt to the development of the illness and prescribing new health promotion methods of care, with a focus on nutrition, education and patient supervision. IBD, immunology and nutrition are the main focus in the selected articles, with presentation of possible connections to contribute to broader understanding of the illness. This present article is part of an empirical research project and is providing an overview of the current research knowledge in this field. The article is based on an extensive, systematic survey of literature comprising 28 review and original articles from June 2008 to July 2009. The important topics are emphasized and described.RESULTSTwo areas of knowledge are considered instrumental in inter-disciplinary health-promoting work with IBD patients: a focus on gut immunology and stress, nutritional care and diet. Healing damage to the gut wall by introducing an individually prescribed diet may take time, but will reduce internal stress on the body. Documentation shows that use of probiotics, fatty acids and antioxidants has been effective in a number of clinical scenarios relating to IBD. Individually prescribed nutrition, primarily through the diet, may be decisive in terms of a sustainable improvement in outcomes for patients with IBD.CONCLUSIONSAddressing the educational challenges in caring to cure suffering from IBD is crucial. Emergency medical treatment helps patients during the acute phase of the disease. Once the acute phase is passed, the recommendation is a focus on investigating the environmental factors that could act as triggers for IBD in humans. Diet is the most important environmental factor in terms of the gut. Proper nutrition and micronutrients assist the body by subtly strengthening its capacity for self-healing and regeneration.

This intellectual and clinical tour-de-force is what we have been waiting for: a book that is on the one hand a coherent, creative, thoughtful, and remarkably integrated view of contemporary psychoanalysis, with attachment, and attachment processes, at its core, and on the other a reflection on our daily, complex, work with patients. The book has three broad aims: first, to ground the reader in attachment theory and research, second, to broaden the reach of attachment theory by building bridges to other aspects of contemporary psychoanalytic theory and science, and third to apply this broader, deeply psychoanalytic, clinical attachment theory to understanding the dynamics of an individual patient and the dynamics of clinical work. This book should be essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary psychoanalysis. Few writers have the ability to write so directly and clearly about complex science and theory; his scholarship and reach are extraordinary. This book is also a book for therapists at all levels of experience. Throughout every section of the book, Wallin writes about his work with patients, about the therapeutic process, about the therapeutic situation, and about the therapeutic relationship, in all its complexity. In the end, he creates a truly contemporary vision of human development, affect regulation, and relational processes, grounded in the body and in the brain, and in the fundamental relationships that make us who we are, as therapists, as patients, and as human beings.

Series B, Biological sciences 372(1711","Linguistic universals arise from the interaction between the processes of language learning and language use. A test case for the relationship between these factors is linguistic variation, which tends to be conditioned on linguistic or sociolinguistic criteria. How can we explain the scarcity of unpredictable variation in natural language, and to what extent is this property of language a straightforward reflection of biases in statistical learning? We review three strands of experimental work exploring these questions, and introduce a Bayesian model of the learning and transmission of linguistic variation along with a closely matched artificial language learning experiment with adult participants. Our results show that while the biases of language learners can potentially play a role in shaping linguistic systems, the relationship between biases of learners and the structure of languages is not straightforward. Weak biases can have strong effects on language structure as they accumulate over repeated transmission. But the opposite can also be true: strong biases can have weak or no effects. Furthermore, the use of language during interaction can reshape linguistic systems. Combining data and insights from studies of learning, transmission and use is therefore essential if we are to understand how biases in statistical learning interact with language transmission and language use to shape the structural properties of language.This article is part of the themed issue 'New frontiers for statistical learning in the cognitive sciences'.",0,1739

Medical Education 51(11","Context: Empathy is an essential aspect of clinical care, associated with improved patient satisfaction, increased adherence to treatment, and fewer malpractice complaints. Previous studies suggest that empathy declines during medical training. However, past research relied on a single narrowly operationalised, self‐report measure of empathy. As empathy is a complex socio‐emotional construct, it is critical to assess changes across its distinct components using multiple measures in order to better understand how it is influenced by medical training. Methods: In a longitudinal study, medical students completed a series of self‐report and behavioural measures twice per year during the first 3 years of their study (2012–2015). These included the previously used Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), designed to assess empathy in the clinical context, the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE), designed to assess overall empathy and its main components, and behavioural measures of sensitivity to others’ pain and understanding of others’ emotions, both of which are important aspects of empathy. The employment of multiple measures allowed for a more complete assessment of medical students’ empathy and related processes. Results: In reflection of findings in previous work, students’ empathy assessed by the JSPE decreased over training. However, on the QCAE, aspects of students’ empathy, specifically overall cognitive empathy and its subcomponent perspective taking, and the emotion contagion subcomponent of affective empathy improved, whereas the remaining subcomponents remained stable. During medical school, students also exhibited comparable growth in their understanding of others’ emotions and increased sensitivity to others’ pain. Conclusions: Changes in empathy during medical school cannot be simply characterised as representing an overall decline. Indeed, aspects of empathy thought to be valuable in positive physician–patient interactions improve during training. Overall, this study points to the importance of assessing the distinct components of empathy using multiple forms of measurement in order to better understand the mechanisms involved in empathy changes in medical practice.

Senior dental students (n=49) were allocated at random to existing dental school-based clinics or placement in primary care clinics to work supervised by local dentists. At baseline, students self-rated their global confidence on a five-point scale. These measures were repeated at follow-up, augmented by a transition judgment and a then-test of confidence (asking students to look back and re-rate their pre-placement confidence). Groups were comparable at baseline. Follow-up scores for global confidence were similar between groups. The outreach group scored higher in the transition judgment (mean 3.7, SD 0.9) than the control group (mean 3.1, SD 1.1, P=0.05).

Narratives were separately analyzed by four authors and then discussed to identify a final thematic framework using parsimonious category construction. We identified two overarching themes: (1) ""Looking back"": experiences which had helped students feel prepared for clerkship with subthemes focused on of patient care, shadowing, classroom teaching and the pre-clerkship years as foundational knowledge, (2) ""Looking forward"": anticipating the clerkship experience and the journey of becoming a physician with subthemes focused on death and dying, hierarchy, work-life balance, interactions with patients, concerns about competency and career choice.

We confirmed that internal transformations are happening in contemplative time even before clerkship.

This study aimed to provide a better understanding of how couples' involvement with SASA!-a violence against women and HIV-related community mobilisation intervention developed by Raising Voices in Uganda-influenced processes of change in relationships. Qualitative data were collected from each partner in separate in-depth interviews following the intervention. Dyadic analysis was conducted using framework analysis methods. Study findings suggest that engagement with SASA! contributed to varied experiences and degrees of change at the individual and relationship levels. Reflection around healthy relationships and communication skills learned through SASA! activities or community activists led to more positive interaction among many couples, which reduced conflict and IPV. This nurtured a growing trust and respect between many partners, facilitating change in longstanding conflicts and generating greater intimacy and love as well as increased partnership among couples to manage economic challenges. This study draws attention to the value of researching and working with both women, men and couples to prevent IPV and suggests IPV prevention interventions may benefit from the inclusion of relationship skills building and support within the context of community mobilisation interventions.",0,1749

However, research into the proximal antecedents of leader development remains in its infancy. The current longitudinal study sought to broaden current perspectives on the role of self‐attention in promoting leader development, namely growth in leader self‐efficacy and self‐reported emergence into leader roles. The leader development of a sample of 81 managers at an Indian IT company was tracked over three time periods, across approximately 12 months of employment. Random coefficient modeling was employed to model participants’ leader development as a function of their methods of self‐attention. As predicted, reflective self‐attention and ruminative self‐attention were shown to differentially relate to the leader development process. Obtained results have implications for identifying the most effective methods to assist individuals in leveraging their leadership potential.

In 44 eyes (10.3%), SRO was observed and considered the cause of incomplete retinal attachment. Three forms of SRO were identified: subretinal bands (63.6%), subretinal plaques (15.9%), and diffuse SRO (18.2%). One patient had both a band and a plaque. SRO developed in 24 eyes after cryotreatment, 3 after laser, and 2 after combination cryo and laser treatment.

Journal of dairy science 100(12","Basic knowledge of mechanisms controlling reproductive processes in mammals was limited in the early 20th century. Discoveries of physiologic processes and mechanisms made early in the last century laid the foundation to develop technologies and programs used today to manage and control reproduction in dairy cattle. Beyond advances made in understanding of gonadotropic support and control of ovarian and uterine functions in basic reproductive biology, advancements made in artificial insemination (AI) and genetics facilitated rapid genetic progress of economically important traits in dairy cattle. Technologies associated with management have each contributed to the evolution of reproductive management, including (1) hormones to induce estrus and ovulation to facilitate AI programs; (2) pregnancy diagnosis via ultrasonography or by measuring conceptus-derived pregnancy-associated glycoproteins; (3) estrus-detection aids first devised for monitoring only physical activity but that now also quantitate feeding, resting, and rumination times, and ear temperature; (4) sex-sorted semen; (5) computers and computerized record software packages; (6) handheld devices for tracking cow location and retrieving cow records; and (7) genomics for increasing genetic progress of reproductive and other economically important traits. Because of genetic progress in milk yield and component traits, the dairy population in the United States has been stable since the mid 1990s, with approximately 9 to 9.5 million cows. Therefore, many of these technologies and changes in management have been developed in the face of increasing herd size (4-fold since 1990), and changes from pastoral or dry-lot dairies to increased housing of cows in confinement buildings with freestalls and feed-line lockups. Management of groups of ""like"" cows has become equally important as management of the one. Management teams, including owner-managers, herdsmen, AI representatives, milkers, and numerous consultants dealing with health, feeding, and facilities, became essential to develop working protocols, monitor training and day-to-day chores, and evaluate current trends and revenues. Good management teams inspect and follow through with what is routinely expected of workers. As herd size will undoubtedly increase in the future, practical reproductive management must evolve to adapt to the new technologies that may find more herds being milked robotically and applying technologies not yet conceived or introduced.",0,1753

Education for health (Abingdon, England","BACKGROUNDThe gap between what is known and what is done about public health (the evidence-practice gap) needs addressing. One solution may be through mixed and participatory training in accessing and appraising research.APPROACHResidential workshops trained policy-makers, practitioners and researchers from seven southern-African countries in evidence-based decision-making for HIV prevention. They included training in accessing, critiquing and summarizing research, whilst remaining responsive to the priorities of the participants.REFLECTIONSDrawing on the participants' feedback and our observations, we reflected on how these workshops may have addressed the evidence-practice gap. We identified three areas: access to research, understanding of research and the relevance of research. The workshops enabled a small group of people to access relevant research in a timely manner. However, more needs to be done to disseminate research findings appropriately as any long-term impact will be affected by the political and economic context in which participants work. We are confident that the participants went away with increased understanding of the purposes and processes of research, but for research to make a difference, the research community needs to emphasise more the publication of research findings written for potential users. The workshops were most successful in influencing researchers to consider bridging the evidence-practice gap by producing more relevant research, applicable to policy-makers and practitioners.CONCLUSIONThis intensive intervention has the potential to reduce the evidence-practice gap for HIV prevention in southern Africa by training non-researchers to engage with research, whilst providing an opportunity for researchers to engage with policy-makers and practitioners.",0,1754

In September 2008, in Zurich, a NanoImpactNet environmental workshop focused on three key questions: 1. What properties should be characterised for nanomaterials used in environmental and ecotoxicology studies? 2. What reference materials should be developed for use in environmental and ecotoxicological studies? 3. Is it possible to group different nanomaterials into categories for consideration in environmental studies? Such questions have been, at least partially, addressed by other projects/workshops especially in relation to human health effects. Such projects provide a useful basis on which this workshop was based, but in this particular case these questions were reformulated in order to focus specifically on environmental studies. The workshop participants, through a series of discussion and reflection sessions, generated the conclusions listed below. The physicochemical characterisation information identified as important for environmental studies included measures of aggregation/agglomeration/dispersability, size, dissolution (solubility), surface area, surface charge, surface chemistry/composition, with the assumption that chemical composition would already be known. There is a need to have test materials for ecotoxicology, and several substances are potentially useful, including TiO(2) nanoparticles, polystyrene beads labelled with fluorescent dyes, and silver nanoparticles. Some of these test materials could then be developed into certified reference materials over time. No clear consensus was reached regarding the classification of nanomaterials into categories to aid environmental studies, except that a chemistry-based classification system was a reasonable starting point, with some modifications. It was suggested, that additional work may be required to derive criteria that can be used to generate such categories, that would also include aspects of the material structure and physical behaviour.",0,1755

The purpose of this study was to explore medical teachers' views on the benefits of introducing a reflective writing exercise into an undergraduate medical curriculum, including their levels of satisfaction and their concerns. We also investigated effects on the teachers' personal and professional development arising from their roles as novice facilitators.METHODSA qualitative approach was employed using semi-structured interviews. During an attachment to Primary Care Medicine course, fourth-year medical students (n = 180) in the Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were assigned to write a reflective essay titled, ""A Significant Event in My First Clinical Year"". After reading the essays and facilitating between one to three small group discussions based on these, each of the 18 teachers enrolled in our study completed an in-depth face to face interview. Transcripts of these were studied, using thematic content analysis to identify emerging themes.RESULTSThe novice facilitators felt that facilitated reflection was both valuable and appropriate for students. They also perceived that it had a positive impact on their own personal and professional lives. In the early phase of implementing this activity, teachers expressed concerns about 1) their ability and confidence as facilitators in small group discussion 2) their ability to deal with emotions raised within their groups 3) the effectiveness of the activity 4) poor presentation and possible fabrication of student work.CONCLUSIONSMost teachers regarded this activity as being beneficial to them, to student learning, and to the curriculum.

Post-practicum, the period immediately following clinical experiences, is a time when students have an opportunity to share, compare and engage critically in considering how these experiences impact on their learning. Reflective practice has merit in facilitating this process.AIMThis project aimed to optimise the learning potential of practice-based experiences by enhancing midwifery students' capacity for reflective practice through writing.METHODSDesign-based research was used to implement an educational intervention aimed at developing reflective practice skills and enhance reflective writing. The Bass Model of Holistic Reflection was introduced to promote the development of reflective capacity in midwifery students. Academics and midwifery students were provided with guidance and resources on how to apply the model to guide reflective writing. Students' written reflections completed before (n=130) and after the introduction of the intervention (n=96) were evaluated using a scoring framework designed to assess sequential development of reflective capacity.FINDINGSThe pre-intervention scores ranked poorly as evidence of reflective capacity. All scores improved post-intervention.CONCLUSIONSThe introduction of a holistic structured model of reflection resulted in improved scores across all five components of reflective writing; self-awareness, sources of knowledge, reflection and critical reflection, evidence informed practice and critical thinking. While further work is required the results show that the implementation process and use of the Bass Model enables students to demonstrate their capacity to reflect-on-practice through their writing.",0,1759

It was proved before that the eukaryotic budding yeast twinfilin-1 can efficiently bind and severe actin filaments in vitro at low pH values. In the present work steady-state anisotropy measurements revealed that twinfilin can bind efficiently to F-actin. Dilution-induced depolymerization assay proved that mammalian twinfilin-1 has an actin filament severing activity. This severing activity was more pronounced at low pH values. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy measurements could support the severing activity of mouse twinfilin-1. The average rate of depolymerization was more apparent at low pH values. The differential scanning calorimetry measurements demonstrated that mammalian twinfilin-1 could reduce the stiffness within the actin filaments before the detachment of the actin protomers. The structural and dynamic reorganization of actin can support the twinfilin-1 induced separation of actin protomers. The measured data indicated that mammalian twinfilin-1 was able to accelerate the monomers dissociation and/or sever the filaments effectively at low pH values.

During the lifetime of this disease, other possible causes have been investigated. These include vitamin E as a prophylaxis against retinopathy of prematurity and the efficacy of light reduction to prevent retinopathy of prematurity. It has been shown that the light reduction does not play a role in reducing the progression of retinopathy of prematurity. Vitamin E studies were inconclusive; some studies show a positive effect and others do not. A major advance occurred with the development of the International Classification of Ophthalmology in 1984, which laid the groundwork for collaborative studies to determine whether cryotherapy of the avascular zone of retina would reduce the incidence of blindness in newborn infants, when compared with control subjects. The study showed that cryotherapy was effective; this was followed by laser photocoagulation when lasers became portable enough to take to the neonatal intensive care unit. At the same time, improved surgical techniques moved from scleral buckling for retinal detachment to vitrectomies (some lens sparing) for more desperate cases that had progressed to stage 4 and stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity.

Immersion programs encourage self-reflection on attitudes towards cultural differences, provide opportunities to build relationships and work with community members, and allow students to apply knowledge and skills learned in training programs in a supervised practice setting. The aim of this paper is to describe midwifery students' reflections on a remote Aboriginal clinical placement that has been offered at a Western Australian university since 2010.METHODSInterviews were conducted over a period of 15 months with the first seven participants who completed the program. At the time of interview, four participants were in the final year of their undergraduate degree and three were practicing midwives. In addition, access was given to a detailed journal kept by one participant during the placement. Interviews also were conducted with midwifery staff at the university and practice setting, although the focus of this paper is upon the student experience.RESULTSStudent selection, preparation and learning experiences as well as implications of the placement for midwifery practice are described. The remote clinical placement was highly valued by all students and recommended to others as a profound learning experience. Highlights centred on connections made with community members and cultural knowledge learned experientially, while challenges included geographic and professional isolation and the complexities of health care delivery in remote settings, especially to pregnant and birthing Aboriginal women.

Several studies have documented veterinary staff and students' generally positive feedback on group learning activities, but one largely unaddressed question is how students actually learn from each other. This study examined how second-year veterinary students learned from each other during a collaborative, case-based learning project. Data were students' written reflections on their learning in the veterinary course and the specific learning experience, and a matched pre- and post-task questionnaire. Consistent with prior research describing veterinary students as individualistic learners, only a third of students spontaneously mentioned learning from each other as one of their most effective strategies. However, when prompted to describe a time when they felt that group members were really learning from each other, students reported highly valuable collaborative learning processes, which they explicitly linked to learning and understanding benefits. Questionnaire data were consistent, showing that students became more positive toward several aspects of the activity as well as toward group work in general. One unexpected finding was the lack of a relationship between students' self-evaluation of their learning and how well group members knew each other. These findings provide strong support for the educational value of collaborative, case-based learning. In light of other research evidence (using observation data) that the amount of time students actually engage in high-level collaborative processes may be rather limited, this article points to the need for veterinary teachers to better prepare students for group learning activities.",0,1770

Journal of educational evaluation for health professions 14: 18.","Community pharmacies in Nepal and other South Asian countries are in a mediocre state due to poor regulation and the fact that many pharmacies are run by people with insufficient training in dispensing. This has led to the inappropriate use of medicines. The problems due to poor regulation and the mediocre state of community pharmacies in South Asia encompass both academia and clinical practice. In this paper, a 2-week community pharmacy internship programme completed by 2 graduating pharmacy students of Pokhara University (a Nepalese public university) at Sankalpa Pharmacy, Pokhara, Nepal is illustrated. During the internship, they were systematically trained on store management, pharmaceutical care, counselling skills, the use of medical devices, pharmaceutical business plans, medicine information sources, and adverse drug reaction reporting. An orientation, observations and hands-on training, case presentation, discussion, and feedback from 2 senior pharmacists were used as the training method. A proper community pharmacy internship format, good pharmacy practice standards, and a better work environment for pharmacists may improve the quality of community pharmacies.",0,1773

Patient Education and Counseling.","OBJECTIVES: To gain a deeper understanding of fourth year medical students’ reflections on emotions in the context of breaking bad news (BBN). METHODS: During the years 2010–2012, students reflected on their emotions concerning BBN in a learning assignment at the end of the communications skills course. The students were asked to write a description of how they felt about a BBN case. The reflections were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: 351 students agreed to participate in the study. We recognized ten categories in students’ reflections namely empathy, insecurity, anxiety, sadness, ambivalence, guilt, hope, frustration, gratefulness and emotional detachment. Most students expressed empathy, but there was a clear tension between feeling empathy and retaining professional distance by emotional detachment. CONCLUSIONS: Students experience strong and perplexing emotions during their studies, especially in challenging situations. A deeper understanding of students' emotions is valuable for supporting students’ professional development and coping in their work in the future. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Medical students need opportunities to reflect on emotional experiences during their education to find strategies for coping with them. Emotions should be actively discussed in studies where the issues of BBN are addressed. Teachers need education in attending emotional issues constructively.

(2016"," ""Nanostructured silicon via metal assisted catalyzed etch (MACE","There are a range of different methods to generate a nanostructured surface on silicon (Si) but the most cost effective and optically interesting is the metal assisted wet chemical etching (MACE) (Koynov et al 2006 Appl. Phys. Lett. 88 203107). MACE of Si is a controllable, room-temperature wet-chemical technique that uses a thin layer of metal to etch the surface of Si, leaving behind various nano- and micro-scale surface features or 'black silicon'. MACE-fabricated nanowires (NWs) provide improved antireflection and light trapping functionality (Toor et al 2016 Nanoscale 8 15448-66) compared with the traditional 'iso-texturing' (Campbell and Green 1987 J. Appl. Phys. 62 243-9). The resulting lower reflection and improved light trapping can lead to higher short circuit currents in NW solar cells (Toor et al 2011 Appl. Phys. Lett. 99 103501). In addition, NW cells can have higher fill factors and voltages than traditionally processed cells, thus leading to increased solar cell efficiencies (Cabrera et al 2013 IEEE J. Photovolt. 3 102-7). MACE NW processing also has synergy with next generation Si solar cell designs, such as thin epitaxial-Si and passivated emitter rear contact (Toor et al 2016 Nanoscale 8 15448-66). While several companies have begun manufacturing black Si, and many more are researching these techniques, much of the work has not been published in traditional journals and is publicly available only through conference proceedings and patent publications, which makes learning the field challenging. There have been three specialized review articles published recently on certain aspects of MACE or black Si, but do not present a full review that would benefit the industry (Liu et al 2014 Energy Environ.

Issues in Mental Health Nursing.","Enhancing therapeutic relationships between patients and staff is of central importance to improve the quality and safety of care in psychiatric inpatient units. However, there is limited evidence as to how therapeutic relationships may be enabled in this specific context. This paper presents findings of a study that explored the link between therapeutic relationships and safety in Iranian psychiatric inpatient units. In this exploratory, descriptive study, seven patients at the point of discharge and 19 staff in psychiatric inpatient units in Iran were interviewed regarding their experiences of care. The quality of staff-patient relationship in providing a safe environment was categorized into two groups of 'facilitators' and 'inhibitors'. Facilitators of a safe environment included 'supportive relationship with patients' and 'improving patient capacity for self-efficacy/self-control'. Inhibitors, on the other hand, included 'detachment from patients' and 'domination over patients', which ultimately limited safety on the ward. Findings indicate interrelated environmental, patient and staff factors mediating the potential for therapeutic relationships and quality and safety of care. Findings suggest the need for more effective preparation and support for staff working within psychiatric inpatient settings. In addition, environments more conducive to collaborative recovery-oriented practice are required to enhance therapeutic relationships and improve quality and safety of care. Both individual staff responsibility and effective leadership are required to realize change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1783

Method: A randomized, controlled trial comparing MBCT + TAU (n = 102) with TAU alone (n = 103). The study population consisted of patients with three or more previous depressive episodes. Primary outcome measure was post-treatment depressive symptoms according to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Secondary outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, rumination, worry and mindfulness skills. Group comparisons were carried out with linear mixed modelling, controlling for intra-group correlations. Additional mediation analyses were performed. Comparisons were made between patients with and without a current depressive episode. Results: Patients in the MBCT + TAU group reported less depressive symptoms, worry and rumination and increased levels of mindfulness skills compared with patients receiving TAU alone. MBCT resulted in a comparable reduction of depressive symptoms for patients with and without a current depressive episode. Additional analyses suggest that the reduction of depressive symptoms was mediated by decreased levels of rumination and worry. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that MBCT is as effective for patients with recurrent depression who are currently depressed as for patients who are in remission. Directions towards a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of MBCT are given, although future research is needed to support these hypotheses.

The search was limited to articles published from January 1995 to December 2015. All articles obtained from the search were carefully screened and their references were manually reviewed for additional relevant data. Our search specifically focused on preoperative clinical data that were associated with the surgical outcomes. After categorizing the available data according to their level of evidence, with randomized-controlled clinical trials as the highest possible level of evidence, followed by retrospective studies, and retrospective case series as the lowest level of evidence, we proceeded to design a logical decision-making algorithm, enhanced by our experiences as retinal surgeons. A total of 7 randomized-controlled clinical trials, 19 retrospective studies, and 9 case series were considered. Additional articles were also included in order to support the observations further. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a potentially blinding disorder.

BMC medical education 16: 82.","BACKGROUNDThe introduction of Stellenbosch University's Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (LIC) model as part of the undergraduate medical curriculum offers a unique and exciting training model to develop generalist doctors for the changing South African health landscape. At one of these LIC sites, the need for an improvement of the local learning experience became evident. This paper explores how to identify and implement a tailored teaching and learning intervention to improve workplace-based learning for LIC students.METHODSA participatory action research approach was used in a co-operative inquiry group (ten participants), consisting of the students, clinician educators and researchers, who met over a period of 5 months. Through a cyclical process of action and reflection this group identified a teaching intervention.RESULTSThe results demonstrate the gaps and challenges identified when implementing a LIC model of medical education. A structured learning programme for the final 6 weeks of the students' placement at the district hospital was designed by the co-operative inquiry group as an agreed intervention. The post-intervention group reflection highlighted a need to create a structured programme in the spirit of local collaboration and learning across disciplines. The results also enhance our understanding of both students and clinician educators' perceptions of this new model of workplace-based training.CONCLUSIONSThis paper provides practical strategies to enhance teaching and learning in a new educational context. These strategies illuminate three paradigm shifts: (1) from the traditional medical education approach towards a transformative learning approach advocated for the 21(st) century health professional; (2) from the teaching hospital context to the district hospital context; and (3) from block-based teaching towards a longitudinal integrated learning model. A programme based on balancing structured and tailored learning activities is recommended in order to address the local learning needs of students in the LIC model. We recommend that action learning sets should be developed at these LIC sites, where the relevant aspects of work-place based learning are negotiated.",0,1791

Moreover, the traditional concept of mind wandering tendency/frequency based on the self- or probe-caught methods alone is incoherent and problematic. We developed a new approach to characterize the mind wandering process by combining the self-caught and probe-caught methods to estimate the time of focus and time of mind wandering separately, and examined their relationship to working memory capacity. Participants performed an OSPAN task and subsequently a basic Mindfulness Meditation Task (focus on breath). During the meditation task, participants indicated when they became aware that they were mind wandering (self-caught method), or were asked if they were mind wandering when probed (probe-caught method). Results showed that time of focus but not time of mind wandering increased with greater working memory capacity. This suggests that individuals with higher working memory capacity were able to focus on the current task longer, but had little effect on the ability to monitor and terminate mind wandering once it occurred. The theoretical and methodological implications of this new approach are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1792

We examined several gaps regarding these models in the context of lab-induced stress. Non-depressed undergraduates completed a rumination questionnaire and either a negative-evaluative Trier Social Stress Test (n = 55) or a non-evaluative control condition (n = 69), followed by a modified Sternberg affective working memory task assessing the extent to which irrelevant negative information can be emptied from working memory. We measured shame, negative and positive affect, and salivary cortisol four times. Multilevel growth curve models showed rumination and stress interactively predicted cortisol reactivity; however, opposite predictions, greater rumination was associated with blunted cortisol reactivity to stress. Elevated trait rumination interacted with stress to predict augmented shame reactivity. Rumination and stress did not significantly interact to predict working memory performance, but under control conditions, rumination predicted greater difficulty updating working memory. Results support a vulnerability-stress model of trait rumination with heightened shame reactivity and cortisol dysregulation rather than hyper-reactivity in non-depressed emerging adults, but we cannot provide evidence that working memory processes are critical immediately following acute stress.

As part of the patient-doctor course, first-year medical students worked with diabetic patients who were selected by their primary physicians. In preparation for their patient interactions, students were taught basic communication concepts and the role of the relationship in improving patient outcomes, and continuity issues were addressed as students learned to collaboratively develop behavioral-change plans with their patients and then followed their patients' progress over the course of the year.DESCRIPTIONAn educational research trial was conducted to compare the traditional community placement track (shadowing) with the health-coaches track. Students were randomly assigned to the two educational tracks. Health coaches were assigned in pairs to a family medicine patient with diabetes. Under supervision by the patient's medical provider, student pairs worked with the patient in an area of health-behavior change (i.e., weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, or adherence to medication regimen). Students were required to have at least six patient contacts over the course of a year, consisting of at least three face-to-face visits and including one home visit. Didactic sessions with health coaches taught by either a behavioral consultant or health educator covered the basics of diabetes and behavior-change areas appropriate to respective patients. Students were also given reading assignments from communication and health-behavior change literature and handouts for patients. Behavior-change specialists were available as needed for consultation. In support of the health coaching process, students participated in eight small-group discussion sessions (eight students each) led by a behavioral change specialist. Small-group sessions lasted approximately 90 minutes each and contained didactic and experiential elements. Topics were: ""Getting Started"" (interviewing, the patient's story), ""Fundamentals of a Home Visit,"" ""Changing Behaviors"" (stages of change, relapse prevention), ""Home Visit Feedback"" (report and reflections), ""Challenging Patients to Change"" (difficulties, challenging irrational ideas), ""Giving Direct Guidance,"" ""Non-verbal Skills,"" ""Ending and Celebrating"" (terminating the helping relationship). Evaluation methods included a pre- and post-physician belief scale completed by students, pre- and post-provider's evaluation of patient, and a patient-completed health behavior questionnaire. As available, patients' HbA1C levels were compared pre- and post-intervention.DISCUSSIONAs expected, initially some health coach students complained about their perceived increased workloads compared with the workloads of students in the shadowing track. Some students also expressed reservations about their abilities to be effective with their patients, but these complaints diminished as students made contact with patients. For many, this opportunity to establish continuity relationships with patients helped students begin to understand difficulties inherent in effecting health-behavior change. Some students expressed appreciation for the opportunity to discuss their increased self-awareness about communication as well as relationship difficulties and strengths during the small-group sessions. Data analysis is under way. Lessons learned from this project influenced a major first-year curriculum revision the following year, resulting in increased emphasis on basic communication skills and the use of small groups to reach a variety of curricular objectives.",0,1794

Journal of Affective Disorders 175: 310-319.","Background: Rumination is one of the hallmark characteristics of both anxiety disorders and depression, and has been linked to deficient executive functioning, particularly working memory (WM). Previous findings show that working memory capacity can be increased through training. Methods: The current study explored whether an adaptive stand-alone WM training could increase WMC and consequently reduce rumination, anxiety and depression by means of a double-blind randomized controlled trial in a sample of 98 patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Results: No positive effect of training on WMC was found. In addition, the results show that a WM training was not associated with a reduction of rumination, depression, nor anxiety. Limitations: The high drop-out rate in both groups (20.11% from pre- to post-training) and the overrepresentation of men and use of anti-depressants in the placebo group might have influenced the results. Furthermore, expectations and perceptions about the training might have interacted with performance on WM tasks. Conclusions: Overall, results show that a stand-alone WM training in patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression does not result in reduced rumination nor in reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. We discuss potential explanations for these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1798

English language studies were included which described primary research relating to the attitudes of one or more health care staff groups towards IT. Letters, personal viewpoints, reflections and opinion pieces were not included.RESULTSComplex factors contribute to the formation of attitudes towards IT. Many of the issues identified were around the flexibility of the systems and whether they were 'fit for purpose', along with the confidence and experience of the IT users. The literature suggests that attitudes of practitioners are a significant factor in the acceptance and efficiency of use of IT in practice. The literature also suggested that education and training was a factor for encouraging the use of IT systems.CONCLUSIONSA range of key issues, such as the need for flexibility and usability, appropriate education and training and the need for the software to be 'fit for purpose', showed that organizations need to plan carefully when proposing the introduction of IT-based systems into work practices. The studies reviewed did suggest that attitudes of health care professionals can be a significant factor in the acceptance and efficiency of use of IT in practice.

The Clinical Supervisor 31(2","As a perspective on close relationships, attachment theory has been meaningfully used to stimulate understanding of parent-child, romantic partner, and even psychotherapeutic relationships. But how useful is attachment theory in stimulating understanding of the psychotherapy supervision relationship? In this article, we examine that question by (1) reviewing the primary conceptual/practical works where an attachment-informed vision of supervision has been proposed; (2) reviewing the limited empirical studies that have in some way addressed attachment concepts in supervision; and (3) considering what implications might be drawn from those conceptual/practical and research works. Based on our study and reflection, we propose and offer some discussion of the following ideas: (1) the psychotherapy supervisee-supervisor relationship, while having the potential to develop into an attachment bond, might best be viewed as involving an affective component that leads to the evoking of attachment dynamics (rather than 'full-blown attachment'); (2) the attachment investigation of supervision has lacked for a conceptual model and an anchoring conceptual location; and (3) the attachment-supervision interface might be most meaningfully explored by locating that relationship within the context of leader-follower attachment relationships. Building on the attachment-supervision and leader-follower literature, some seemingly defensible and measureable hypotheses are proposed about the supervision-attachment relationship and tentatively offered as possible stimulants for pushing research in this area forward.

Cognitive Behaviour Therapy 38(Suppl 1","Rumination has been identified as a core process in the development and maintenance of depression. Treatments targeting ruminative processes may, therefore, be particularly helpful for treating chronic and recurrent depression. The development of such treatments requires translational research that marries clinical trials, process–outcome research, and basic experimental research that investigates the mechanisms underpinning pathological rumination. For example, a program of experimental research has demonstrated that there are distinct processing modes during rumination that have distinct functional effects for the consequences of rumination on a range of clinically relevant cognitive and emotional processes: an adaptive style characterized by more concrete, specific processing and a maladaptive style characterized by abstract, overgeneral processing. Based on this experimental work, two new treatments for depression have been developed and evaluated: (a) rumination-focused cognitive therapy, an individual-based face-to-face therapy, which has encouraging results in the treatment of residual depression in an extended case series and a pilot randomized controlled trial; and (b) concreteness training, a facilitated self-help intervention intended to increase specificity of processing in patients with depression, which has beneficial findings in a proof-of-principle study in a dysphoric population. These findings indicate the potential value of process–outcome research (a) explicitly targeting identified vulnerability processes and (b) developing interventions informed by research into basic mechanisms.

Thus, the neural basis underlying how this fundamental quality of light is detected is of broad interest. Morphologically unique, polarization-sensitive ommatidia exist in the dorsal periphery of many insect retinas, forming the dorsal rim area (DRA). However, much less is known about the retinal substrates of behavioral responses to polarized reflections.SUMMARYDrosophila exhibits polarotactic behavior, spontaneously aligning with the e-vector of linearly polarized light, when stimuli are presented either dorsally or ventrally. By combining behavioral experiments with genetic dissection and ultrastructural analyses, we show that distinct photoreceptors mediate the two behaviors: inner photoreceptors R7+R8 of DRA ommatidia are necessary and sufficient for dorsal polarotaxis, whereas ventral responses are mediated by combinations of outer and inner photoreceptors, both of which manifest previously unknown features that render them polarization sensitive.CONCLUSIONSDrosophila uses separate retinal pathways for the detection of linearly polarized light emanating from the sky or from shiny surfaces.

Pharmacodynamic monitoring is a more recent strategy to provide information about the biologic effect of a specific drug or drug combination on the individual transplant patient. Currently, there is a large number of different biomarkers that either directly (specific markers) or indirectly (global markers) relate to the pharmacodynamic effects of immunosuppressive drugs and are under investigation as potential candidates to be introduced in clinical practice. Such biomarkers may be useful to identify patients at risk of developing acute rejection, infection, or cancer as well as patients who are suitable for minimization of immunosuppressant therapy and may be helpful to manage the timing and rate of immunosuppressant weaning. Serial longitudinal monitoring may allow maintenance of an individualized immunosuppressive regimen. Thus, biomarker monitoring is a potential complementary tool to therapeutic drug monitoring.

Thus, visual art dialogues in student nurses' education could be a valuable teaching/learning complement to theoretical knowledge. The aim of this study is to investigate the ways in which student nurses intended to conduct a dialogue with a patient using a painting as a starting point. The study was conducted in the students' second year at a university college of health sciences in Sweden. In all, 50 students (47 female and three male) participated. The students had previously received a short introduction to art perception of some of the museums' paintings by the curator. This included observation and reflection on specific works of art. When they had studied several works of art at the museum they were asked to select one work of art from a series of 12 paintings that they thought might be used as a conversation tool with patients. The selection of these paintings was performed on basis of methods in psychological and art scientific research into aesthetic reactions to and perception of art tendencies.

Psychological Medicine 46(12","Background: It is unclear which potentially modifiable risk factors best predict post-trauma psychiatric disorders. We aimed to identify pre-trauma risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or major depression (MD) that could be targeted with resilience interventions. Method: Newly recruited paramedics (n = 453) were assessed for history of mental disorders with structured clinical interviews within the first week of their paramedic training and completed self-report measures to assess hypothesized predictors. Participants were assessed every 4 months for 2 years to identify any episodes of PTSD and MD; 386 paramedics (85.2%) participated in the follow-up interviews. Results: In all, 32 participants (8.3%) developed an episode of PTSD and 41 (10.6%) an episode of MD during follow-up. In all but nine cases (2.3%), episodes had remitted by the next assessment 4 months later. At 2 years, those with episodes of PTSD or MD during follow-up reported more days off work, poorer sleep, poorer quality of life, greater burn-out; and greater weight-gain for those with PTSD. In line with theories of PTSD and depression, analyses controlling for psychiatric and trauma history identified several pre-trauma predictors (cognitive styles, coping styles and psychological traits). Logistic regressions showed that rumination about memories of stressful events at the start of training uniquely predicted an episode of PTSD. Perceived resilience uniquely predicted an episode of MD. Conclusions: Participants at risk of developing episodes of PTSD or depression could be identified within the first week of paramedic training. Cognitive predictors of episodes of PTSD and MD are promising targets for resilience interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,1810

The Cochrane database of systematic reviews(9","BACKGROUNDAsymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are visible lesions that are risk factors for later retinal detachment. Retinal detachments occur when fluid in the vitreous cavity passes through tears or holes in the retina and separates the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Creation of an adhesion surrounding retinal breaks and lattice degeneration, with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, has been recommended as an effective means of preventing retinal detachment. This therapy is of value in the management of retinal tears associated with the symptoms of flashes and floaters and persistent vitreous traction upon the retina in the region of the retinal break, because such symptomatic retinal tears are associated with a high rate of progression to retinal detachment. Retinal tears and holes unassociated with acute symptoms and lattice degeneration are significantly less likely to be the sites of retinal breaks that are responsible for later retinal detachment. Nevertheless, treatment of these lesions frequently is recommended, in spite of the fact that the effectiveness of this therapy is unproven.OBJECTIVESThe objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to treat asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for the prevention of retinal detachment.SEARCH METHODSWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2014), PubMed (January 1948 to February 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).

We found that there is little research literature specifically addressing ethics in pharmacy practice and almost none addressing fundamental philosophical issues or values for pharmacy ethics. There is no dedicated journal for pharmacy ethics. Most material relating to pharmacy ethics is articulated as codes or pronouncements from professional bodies, as opinion or reflection in textbooks and in debate such as letters and articles. However, this should not be taken to mean that pharmacy and ethics are strangers; simply that such matters are not frequently analysed in published pharmacy literature. The presumption is usually that most matters of pharmacy ethics are very familiar and require no exploration or explanation. Where the research literature does target ethical issues, the most common method is to employ ""the scenario approach"". This term describes the technique of using a vignette or scenario from actual pharmacy practice and then exploring a variety of possible options to identify one or more defensible solutions. The vast majority of scenarios related to the delivery of healthcare per se; rather fewer derived from delivery of healthcare in a commercial environment. One notable exception to this approach is the body of work by Latif and colleagues on moral reasoning and community pharmacy practice. Our review suggests there is a need for the knowledge base in pharmacy ethics to be systematised and integrated into the wider scheme of general healthcare ethics. The principal areas in which research is needed include, how best to teach and assess ""ethical competence"" before practice; how to develop and update this competence in practising pharmacists; and how the business environment, particularly where there are corporate values and reward systems in operation, affects ethical competence. In addition, general research in pharmacy practice may benefit from a greater awareness and enquiry as to the ethical issues raised by the projects being undertaken.",0,1813

Healthcare workers from various backgrounds can be effectively trained in delivering MI interventions; however, there has been limited evidence that peers can effectively deliver MI interventions with fidelity. Peers have traditionally worked in HIV care settings and represent a valid context for a peer-delivered intervention focused on motivational issues. We trained four peers in MI. In this paper, we describe the intervention, explain the MI training methods, and investigate whether peers can be trained in MI with fidelity. The MI training included didactic instruction, group workshops, and individual feedback sessions. Two of four peers achieved MI treatment fidelity as measured by the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code Version 3.0. Overall, peers had difficulty using open-ended questions and querying pros and cons, skills thought necessary to elicit change talk. They also tended to give too much direct advice where reflections would have been appropriate. A challenge was training peers to change familiar ways of communicating. Nonetheless, they did well at assessing and highlighting motivation to change. The total training hours (40 h) was long compared with other published MI studies.

However, pre-service teacher education programmes still do not pay adequate attention to HIV education, particularly in institutions where students are being prepared to work in environments that are perceived to be unaffected by the consequences of the pandemic. This article advocates that HIV education should be integrated into contexts of privilege and presents evidence of the influence that a critical pedagogical approach can have on changing student perceptions of the need to address HIV in and through their teaching. We led 109 Post-graduate Certificate of Education students through a series of activities that required them to critically reflect on their feelings, attitudes and perceived skills with regard to HIV and AIDS education; to identify potential areas of personal change; and to begin to imagine alternative professional possibilities. We generated qualitative data through drawings, group discussions, individual written reflections, and a voluntary focus group. A content analysis of the data revealed that the participating students initially felt incompetent to incorporate HIV and related issues into their teaching, and felt hesitant and uncomfortable at the prospect. However, a critical reflection on their thinking, both individually and in a group setting, served to shift them towards a more holistic, critical and humanising understanding of the pandemic and the role they could play as future teachers in helping to mitigate its impact.

Mindfulness.","Self-compassion can improve mental health and enable individuals to develop aspects of prosocial motivation such as forgiveness. Self-compassion is associated with forgiveness; however, cognitive and emotional mechanisms underlying this association remain underexplored. Based on Worthington’s stress-and-coping theory of forgiveness, we examined the roles of rumination and anger—two typical psychological responses to interpersonal transgressions—in the relationship between self-compassion and forgiveness. By analyzing a sample of 358 Chinese college students (132 male students, mean age = 19.18 years), we determined that self-compassion and forgiveness were negatively associated with anger and rumination. Structural equation modeling results revealed that self-compassion was associated with forgiveness directly and indirectly through decreased anger and rumination. Furthermore, rumination was associated with forgiveness indirectly through anger. These findings indicate that anger is a proximal predictor of forgiveness. The results of the present study suggest that increasing self-compassion, reducing rumination, and alleviating anger are substantial and interventive processes for cultivating forgiveness.

Journal of Organizational Behavior 39(4","This diary study examines the psychological processes that contribute to daily recovery from emotional labor by combining emotion regulation with work‐home resources theories. We hypothesized that overall perceptions of display rules relate positively to daily deep and surface acting. Daily surface acting was expected to relate positively to exhaustion and negatively to flow during work and consequently, to a higher need for recovery at the end of the workday. In contrast, daily deep acting was hypothesized to relate positively to flow and negatively to exhaustion and consequently, to a lower need for recovery at the end of the workday. In turn, need for recovery was expected to associate negatively to vigor at bedtime through reduced relaxation during leisure. Fifty Dutch and Polish employees first filled in a survey, and then a diary for five consecutive workdays, twice per day: at the end of the workday and before sleep. Multilevel path analyses largely supported these hypotheses suggesting that surface acting has unfavorable implications, whereas deep acting has favorable implications for daily well‐being at work and recovery after work.

We sought to determine the predictive factors of recurrent PVR formation and the need for additional vitreoretinal surgical intervention after uncomplicated primary RD repair.METHODSThis is a retrospective single-center case-control study of consecutive patients with PVR formation after uncomplicated RD repair. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with recurrent PVR formation.RESULTSThirty-seven eyes (37 patients) who had recurrent RD secondary to PVR formation were included. Among those, 27 eyes needed one additional surgery, whereas the remainder 10 eyes required two or more additional surgeries. In the univariate analysis, patients who had cystoid macular edema (CME) after the second surgery were 8.33 times (crude odds ratio [COR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-56.67, p=0.0302) more likely to have recurrent PVR formation compared to those who did not have CME after the second surgery. Similarly, those who had epiretinal membrane (ERM) after the second surgery were 8.00 times (COR, 95% CI: 1.43-44.92, p=0.0182) more likely to have recurrent PVR formation compared to those who did not have ERM after the second surgery. In the multivariate analysis, patients who had ERM after the second surgery were 8.20 times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 95% CI: 1.08-62.40, p=0.0422) more likely to develop recurrent PVR compared to those who did not have ERM after the second surgery, when adjusted for age, sex, and CME after the second surgery.CONCLUSIONERM and CME are potential predictive factors for recurrent PVR formation after uncomplicated primary RD repair.

Applying Conservation of Resource theory, we argue that politically skilled individuals are more cognizant of the social embeddedness of WIF, and because of cross-domain resource (e.g. time, attention, energy) depletion, lack the resources to cope with its effects. As such, they leverage their political skill to more effectively turnover from the organization than less politically skilled individuals by detaching their identity and lowering their affective commitment to their organization. We tested the hypotheses using a sample of 181 individuals from a retail firm, and results support the hypothesized model. First, a test of indirect effects confirmed that affective commitment partially mediated the link between WIF and voluntary turnover (measured six months later). Second, a moderated-mediation test revealed, as hypothesized, that affective commitment only functioned as a mediator for individual with high levels of political skill.

Section D, Biological crystallography 62: 901-908.","The ACORN system was originally developed as a means of ab initio solution of protein structures when atomic resolution data were available. The first step is to obtain a starting set of phases, which must be at least slightly better than random. These may be calculated from a fragment of the structure, which can be anything from a single metal atom to a complete molecular-replacement model. A number of standard procedures are available in ACORN to orientate and position such a fragment. The fragment provides initial phases that give the first of a series of maps that are iteratively refined by a dynamic density-modification (DDM) process. Another FFT-based procedure is Sayre-equation refinement (SER), which modifies phases better to satisfy the Sayre equation. With good-quality atomic resolution data, the final outcome of applying DDM and SER is a map similar in appearance to that found from a refined structure, which is readily interpreted by automated procedures. Further development of ACORN now enables structures to be solved with less than atomic resolution data. A critical part of this development is the artificial extension of the data from the observed limit to 1 A resolution. These extended reflections are allocated unit normalized structure amplitudes and then treated in a similar way to observed reflections except that they are down-weighted in the calculation of maps. ACORN maps, especially at low resolution, tend to show C atoms less well, in particular C(alpha) atoms which fall within the first diffraction minimum of their three neighbours. Two new density-modification procedures (DDM1 and DDM2) and a density-enhancement procedure (ENH) have been devised to counter this problem. It is demonstrated that high-quality maps showing individual atoms can be produced with the new ACORN. ACORN has also been demonstrated to be very effective in refining phase sets derived from physical processes such as those using anomalous scattering or isomorphous derivative data. Future work will be directed towards applying ACORN to resolutions down to 2 A.",0,1824

Visual Voices is an arts-based participatory data collection method designed to work together with young people and communities to collaboratively elicit, examine, and celebrate the perspectives of youth.OBJECTIVESTo present a process for using the creative arts with young people as a participatory data collection method and to give examples of their perspectives on safety and violence.METHODSUsing the creative arts, this study examined and illustrates the perspectives of how community factors influence safety and violence. Visual Voices was conducted with a total of 22 African-American youth in two urban neighborhoods. This method included creative arts-based writing, drawing, and painting activities designed to yield culturally relevant data generated and explored by youth. Qualitative data were captured through the creative content of writings, drawings, and paintings created by the youths as well as transcripts from audio recorded group discussion. Data was analyzed for thematic content and triangulated across traditional and nontraditional mediums. Findings were interpreted with participants and shared publicly for further reflection and utilization.CONCLUSIONThe youth participants identified a range of issues related to community factors, community safety, and violence. Such topics included the role of schools and social networks within the community as safe places and corner stores and abandoned houses as unsafe places. Visual Voices is a creative research method that provides a unique opportunity for youth to generate a range of ideas through access to the multiple creative methods provided. It is an innovative process that generates rich and valuable data about topics of interest and the lived experiences of young community members.",0,1825

A minimum of 2 months' follow-up was available for 254 eyes. Risk factors for poor anatomic or visual outcome were analyzed by logistic regression.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESPrimary anatomic success, which was defined as an attached retina at least 2 months after the initial surgery, without any additional interventions; final anatomic success, defined as an attached retina at least 2 months after the latest intervention; and visual outcome, defined as the corrected visual acuity at least 2 months after the last operation.RESULTSThe macula was detached at presentation in 332 (91.9%) eyes. In 203 (56.2%) eyes, the retina had been detached for >1 month. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)-grade C1 or worse-was present in 63 (17.5%) eyes. Thirty eyes (8.3%) had giant retinal tears. Ninety-five patients (27.5%) were blind (<20/400 in the better eye) at presentation. The retina was successfully reattached with 1 operation in 186 (73.2%) eyes. The most frequent cause of primary failure was missed breaks or new breaks. The final anatomic success rate in eyes observed for at least 8 weeks after the last operation was 88.2%. Giant retinal tear and PVR were significant independent predictors of anatomic failure. In eyes with successfully reattached retinas, 63.9% achieved 20/200 vision or better. Among successfully reattached macula-off detachments, risk factors for a poor visual outcome (<20/200) were macular hole, duration of retinal detachment >1 month, and poor preoperative acuity. Of 74 blind patients with 2 months' follow-up, only 23 (31.1%) remained blind at the latest follow-up.CONCLUSIONSRetinal detachment is a treatable cause of blindness in Africa. Despite late presentation and complex pathology, surgical repair is frequently successful and often restores navigational vision.

This synthesis suggests that: (1) people vary in their dispositional sense of person-environment mergence (PEM) with, versus ruminative separation (RS) from, their daily locations; and (2) PEM should be associated with greater guilt proneness, while RS should be associated with greater anxiety proneness. We test this account by developing measures of PEM and RS using factor analytic and scale validation approaches (Study 1); by showing predictive relationships between our measures and extant measures of guilt and anxiety proneness (Study 2); and by experimentally manipulating person-environment mergence versus separation to produce causal effects on emotional experience (Study 3).

He thereafter presents some vignettes and examples of analytic work, where intuitive interventions and interpretations appear against a background of ordinary psychoanalytic method. For the analyst, these interventions can feel unexpected, incidental, like ideas out of the blue. On second thoughts, we may sometimes be able to trace and understand how these intuitions are based on non-conscious processes, like counter-transference feelings, an understanding of the patient still unclear and unarticulated for the analyst or perhaps a last desperate attempt to reach the patient and get in contact at a decisive or critical moment. Finally, the author reflects on the double face of psychoanalysis: both a contemplated, carefully described and systematic method and a craft with elements of intuition, creativity and, sometimes, inspiration.

Experimental eye research 83(6","The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of c-fos antisense oligonucleotide (c-fos-AS-ON) on proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Cultures of human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells were established from adult human corneal donors. These cells were positively stained for cytokeratins. C-fos-AS-ON effect on serum-stimulated cell proliferation was estimated by evaluating the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) into cellular DNA. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were respectively performed to quantify the serum-stimulated c-fos gene mRNA and protein expression in hRPE cells. Eight rabbits (16 eyes) were divided into c-fos-AS-ON treatment group and control group. 2.5 x 10(5) cultured hRPE cells were injected into the vitreous cavity of eyes to establish a PVR model. Prevalence of PVR and retinal detachment were determined by indirect ophthalmoscopy on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-injection and by pathological study on days 28 post-injection. The results showed that blocking the expression of c-fos by the addition of c-fos-AS-ON to the culture medium significantly inhibited the hRPE cells proliferation. This effect of c-fos-AS-ON was found to be sequence specific (the use of a sense or a mismatch sense oligonucleotide had no such an effect) and dose-dependent (0.375 microM was the lowest effective dose tested). Growth inhibition by c-fos-AS-ON remained for at least 72 h. By using RT-PCR and Western blotting, we found that the c-fos-AS-ON could specifically inhibit c-fos mRNA and protein synthesis in cultured hRPE cells. Though the eyes injected with c-fos-AS-ON also developed features of PVR, the severities of days 14, 21 and 28 post-injection were significantly lower than those in the control eyes (P<0.05). We conclude that c-fos-AS-ON can inhibit cultured hRPE cell proliferation, which mechanism may relate to blocking the expression of c-fos and can reduce the prevalence of experimental PVR. These findings establish a rationale for investigating the potential use of a c-fos-AS-ON as a novel therapeutical tool in the treatment of PVR.",0,1833

To get a broader understanding of how nurses cope with patient death and to develop meaningful and effective interventions, a systematic review which would help underpin the multidimensional approaches is needed.DESIGNA systematic review.METHODSExhaustive searching in ten databases: CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED, PsycINFO, ProQuest Health & Medical Complete, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Google Scholar, EThOS and CareSearch. Meta-aggregation was used to synthesise the findings of the included studies.RESULTSThis systematic review aggregated ten categories from the sixteen qualitative studies included, and then two synthesised findings were derived: intrinsic resources and extrinsic resources. The intrinsic resources consisted of setting boundaries, reflection, crying, death beliefs, life and work experience, and daily routines and activity. The extrinsic resources were comprised of talking and being heard, spiritual practices, education and programmes, and debriefing.CONCLUSIONThis systematic review synthesised the findings about what resources nurses use when coping with patient death and made recommendations on future directions.

1840,"Zonzi, A., et al. (2014"," ""Zone of proximal development (ZPD","OBJECTIVESThis theory-building case study examined the zone of proximal development (ZPD) in psychotherapy within the assimilation model. Theoretically, the ZPD is the segment of the continuum of therapeutic development within which assimilation of problematic experiences can take place. Work within a problem's current ZPD may be manifested as a Winnicottian ability to play, that is, an ability to adopt a flexible reflexive stance to the presenting problem and be involved in joint examination of possible alternatives. Play may be recognized in the client's receptivity to and creative use of the therapist's formulations of the presenting problems.DESIGN AND METHODSA case was selected from a comparative clinical trial of two very brief psychotherapies for mild to moderate depression, the Two-Plus-One Project (Barkham, Shapiro, Hardy, & Rees, 1999, J. Consult. Clin. Psychol., 67, 201). Martha, a woman in her late forties, received two sessions of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy 1 week apart and a follow-up ('plus one') session approximately 3 months later. Dialogical sequence analysis was used to analyse the transcripts of the three sessions.RESULTSThe analysis revealed Martha's problematic action pattern, which remained unchanged throughout the three sessions. Her ability to use and elaborate the therapist's formulations depended on the referential object that the therapist addressed; in particular, she seemed unable to play with the therapist's formulations of her more problematic experiences.CONCLUSIONSThe case helped elucidate how the ZPD is content dependent. Winnicott's conception of playing emphasizes the quality of client response as an indicator of this content sensitivity. Differing breadths of major problems' ZPD, manifested as differing abilities to play with therapists' formulations may explain why some clients improve in psychotherapy while some do not.PRACTITIONER POINTSAccessing very problematic content may be very difficult even though the client's ability to mentalize other material appears ordinary. Mildly depressed clients who have developed powerful care-taking coping strategies may not respond to very brief therapeutic interventions. A client's minimal acknowledgements may mislead the therapist into supplementing the client's failing self-reflection rather than addressing the issue that provokes this failure.",0,1840
