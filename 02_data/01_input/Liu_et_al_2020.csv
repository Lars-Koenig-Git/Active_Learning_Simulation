1,A prospective study of fatal occupational accidents--relationship to sleeping difficulties and occupational factors,"Very little is known about the association between sleep and (fatal) occupational accidents. This study investigated this relationship using register data of self-rated sleep difficulties, together with occupational and demographic characteristics. The variables were related to subsequent occupational fatal accidents. A national sample of 47,860 individuals (aged 16-over 50 yrs) was selected at regular intervals over a period of 20 years, and interviewed over the phone on issues related to work and health. The responses were linked to the cause of death register (suicides excluded) and the data set was subjected to a (multivariate) Cox regression survival analysis. One hundred and sixty six fatal occupational accidents occurred, and the significant predictors were: male versus female; relative risk; difficulties in sleeping; and non-day work. No significant effect was seen for age, socio-economic group, hectic work, overtime, or physically strenuous work. It was concluded that self-reported disturbed sleep is a predictor of accidental death at work, in addition to non-day work and male gender.

2,The role of childhood trauma in bipolar disorders,"This review will discuss the role of childhood trauma in bipolar disorders. Relevant studies were identified via Medline (PubMed) and PsycINFO databases published up to and including July 2015. This review contributes to a new understanding of the negative consequences of early life stress, as well as setting childhood trauma in a biological context of susceptibility and discussing novel long-term pathophysiological consequences in bipolar disorders. Childhood traumatic events are risk factors for developing bipolar disorders, in addition to a more severe clinical presentation over time (primarily an earlier age at onset and an increased risk of suicide attempt and substance misuse). Childhood trauma leads to alterations of affect regulation, impulse control, and cognitive functioning that might decrease the ability to cope with later stressors. Childhood trauma interacts with several genes belonging to several different biological pathways [Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, serotonergic transmission, neuroplasticity, immunity, calcium signaling, and circadian rhythms] to decrease the age at the onset of the disorder or increase the risk of suicide. Epigenetic factors may also be involved in the neurobiological consequences of childhood trauma in bipolar disorder. Biological sequelae such as chronic inflammation, sleep disturbance, or telomere shortening are potential mediators of the negative effects of childhood trauma in bipolar disorders, in particular with regard to physical health. The main clinical implication is to systematically assess childhood trauma in patients with bipolar disorders, or at least in those with a severe or instable course. The challenge for the next years will be to fill the gap between clinical and fundamental research and routine practice, since recommendations for managing this specific population are lacking. In particular, little is known on which psychotherapies should be provided or which targets therapists should focus on, as well as how childhood trauma could explain the resistance to mood stabilizers.; ","Aas, Monica; Henry, Chantal; Andreassen, Ole A.; Bellivier, Frank; Melle, Ingrid & Etain, Bruno",0,2
3,Comparisons of the prevalence of and risk factors for elderly depression between urban and rural populations in Japan,"Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the differences in the prevalence of and risk factors for elderly depression between urban and rural areas in Japan and to further understanding of the features of elderly depression. Methods: A multistage, random sampling procedure and mailing method were used in urban and rural areas in Kumamoto Prefecture. A total of 2,152 participants aged 65 years and older were evaluated for depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Factors associated with depression were also examined. In order to assess the relationship between risk factors and subjective happiness, the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGC-MS) was used. Results: Depressive symptoms were associated with living alone, being unemployed, chronic illness, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, financial strain, and poor social support; the risk factors for elderly depression were almost the same in the two areas. Although three factors (financial strain, work status, and PGC-MS) were significantly associated with depression in both areas on logistic regression analysis, sleep disturbance was significant only for the urban area, and poor social support was significant only for the rural area. Conclusions: Although factors related to depression did not differ markedly between urban and rural elderly people, some risk factors differed between the two areas. Effective intervention programs for elderly depression should pay more attention to regional differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

4,Sleep disturbances from the viewpoint of suicidality: Implications for future psychosocial interventions for youngsters,"Objective: This review article is an overview and clinical reflection on the relationship between sleep disturbances during adolescence and adulthood. Design and Methods: This clinical review stresses sleep disturbances in terms of somatopsychic maturation. We also focus on the relationship between nightmare and suicidality and the insomnia-depression connection in a Japanese general population sample. Results: Interest is growing in insomnia and nightmare and its symptomatological significance in psychiatric epidemiology. Some recent studies have shown that pubertal development and sleep regulation are important factors for explaining alcohol use in early adolescence. These studies suggest that profound puberty-dependent transitions in sleep patterns might take place during adolescence. Conclusion: Clinical reflections related to sleep disturbance are expected to contribute to the future development of a more thoughtful suicide prevention strategy, especially for youngsters.

5,Suicidal ideation with IFN-Î± and ribavirin in a patient with hepatitis C,"Provides a case report on a 55-yr-old man with hepatitis C being treated with IFN-Î± and ribavarin and investigates the occurrence of suicidal ideation with this treatment. Four months after starting treatment for hepatitis C, he was admitted to the psychiatric ward. At the time of his admission, he met criteria for major depression. Eight days after admission, the subject attempted suicide with trimipramine and zolpidem. After his condition stabilized, he was transferred back to the inpatient psychosomatic unit, and IFN-Î± and ribavarin were stopped. He still complained of insomnia, but he had clearly distanced himself from suicidal ideation and appeared more authentic in interactions with his therapist. He was discharged in a stable mental state, started psychotherapy, returned to work, and continued to do well 6 months after discharge. This approach may serve as an effective starting point for evaluating patients with hepatitis C who are selected for treatment with IFN-Î± and ribavarin.

6,Symptom Profile and Severity in a Sample of Nigerians with Psychotic versus Nonpsychotic Major Depression,"The therapeutic strategies in managing patients with psychotic major depression (PMD) differ from those with non-psychotic major depression (NMD), because of differences in clinical profile and outcome. However, there is underrecognition of psychotic symptoms in depressed patients. Previous studies in Western population suggest that certain symptom patterns, apart from psychosis which may be concealed, can facilitate the discrimination of PMD from NMD. These studies may have limited applicability to sub-Saharan Africa due to cross-cultural differences in the phenomenology of depression. This study compared the rates and severity of depressive symptoms in outpatients with PMD (n = 129) and NMD (n = 117) using the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SCID) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Patients with PMD had statistically significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, psychomotor agitation, insomnia, and reduced appetite. Patients with NMD were more likely to manifest psychomotor retardation and somatic symptoms. PMD was associated with greater symptom severity. On logistic regression analysis, suicidal ideation, psychomotor disturbances, insomnia, and somatic symptoms were predictive of diagnostic status. The presence of these symptoms clusters may increase the suspicion of occult psychosis in patients with depression, thereby informing appropriate intervention strategies.; ","Adeosun, Increase Ibukun & Jeje, Oyetayo",1,6
7,Sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior in patients with major depression,"Examined the association between sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior in 113 Ss (aged 18-70 yrs) with major depression. The sleep symptomatology of each patient was ascertained from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) questions concerning sleep in the section on major depression. The patients were retrospectively classified as having hypersomnia, insomnia, and no sleep disturbance. The SADS suicide subscale was used to rate the severity of active suicidality. The patients with hypersomnia and insomnia had significantly higher scores on the SADS suicide subscale than those without sleep disturbance. The authors also found that the patients with insomnia and hypersomnia were significantly more likely to become suicidal than the others. These data demonstrate that both insomnia and hypersomnia are associated with suicidal behavior in patients with major depression.

8,"Recurrent sleep panic, insomnia, and suicidal behavior in patients with panic disorder","Examined the association between recurrent sleep, panic, and suicidal behavior in panic disorder. The Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) was used to rate the severity of active suicidality in 33 adults (aged 19-55 yrs) with recurrent sleep panic and 34 adults (aged 18-51 yrs) with other types of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) panic. Results indicate that recurrent sleep panickers had a higher SADS suicidality scores and a higher percentage of insomnia and comorbid major depression than the others. A multivariate analysis demonstrated an association between recurrent sleep panic and suicidal tendencies in patients with panic disorder. Although recurrent sleep panic alone is not an independent risk factor for suicidal behavior, it may modify the severity of illness in patients with panic disorder.

9,"Nightmares, suicide attempts, and melancholic features in patients with unipolar major depression","Objectives: Recently, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between sleep disturbances and suicidality in major depression. Sleep disturbances are one of the 'modifiable risks' for suicide in major depression. The present study examines whether there is a relationship among nightmares, suicide attempts, and melancholic features in unipolar major depressed patients. Methods: One hundred (49 males and 51 females) depressed patients with melancholic features and 49 (23 males and 26 females) patients without melancholic features were included in the study. All patients were classified as those who attempted suicide at least once during current depressive episode and as those who never attempted. Results: Melancholic attempters had higher rates of nightmares, middle, and terminal insomnia than melancholic non-attempters. There was no significant difference between non-melancholic patients with and without suicidal attempts in terms of the frequency of all types of insomnia and nightmares. Limitations: This study does not have polysomnographic records for sleep variables. Conclusions: Feeling worse in the morning than later in the day may be related to the intervening dream content and affect and predict suicidal tendency. Melancholia may be associated with increased risk of suicide attempts due to repetitive and frightening dreams. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

10,Subjective sleep quality and suicidality in patients with major depression,"Examined the association between sleep quality and suicidality in major depressive disorder. 41 patients (mean age 34.6 yrs) with major depression were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) suicide subscale. It was found that suicidal depressive patients had significantly higher scores of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency and PSQI global scores than nonsuicidal patients. Significant correlations between the SADS suicide subscale scores and most measures of the PSQI were also found. These data suggest that there is an association between poor subjective sleep quality and suicidal behavior in patients with major depressive disorder.

11,Review of the epidemiologic literature on EMF and Health,"Exposures to extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields (EMF) emanating from the generation, transmission, and use of electricity are a ubiquitous part of modern life. Concern about potential adverse health effects was initially brought to prominence by an epidemiologic report two decades ago from Denver on childhood cancer. We reviewed the now voluminous epidemiologic literature on EMF and risks of chronic disease and conclude the following: a) The quality of epidemiologic studies on this topic has improved over time and several of the recent studies on childhood leukemia and on cancer associated with occupational exposure are close to the limit of what can realistically be achieved in terms of size of study and methodological rigor. b) Exposure assessment is a particular difficulty of EMF epidemiology, in several respects: i) The exposure is imperceptible, ubiquitous, has multiple sources, and can vary greatly over time and short distances. ii) The exposure period of relevance is before the date at which measurements can realistically be obtained and of unknown duration and induction period. iii) The appropriate exposure metric is not known and there are no biological data from which to impute it. c) In the absence of experimental evidence and given the methodological uncertainties in the epidemiologic literature, there is no chronic disease for which an etiological relation to EMF can be regarded as established. d) There has been a large body of high quality data for childhood cancer, and also for adult leukemia and brain tumor in relation to occupational exposure. Among all the outcomes evaluated in epidemiologic studies of EMF, childhood leukemia in relation to postnatal exposures above 0.4 microT is the one for which there is most evidence of an association. The relative risk has been estimated at 2.0 (95% confidence limit: 1.27-3.13) in a large pooled analysis. This is unlikely to be due to chance but, may be, in part, due to bias. This is difficult to interpret in the absence of a known mechanism or reproducible experimental support. In the large pooled analysis only 0.8% of all children were exposed above 0.4 microT. Further studies need to be designed to test specific hypotheses such as aspects of selection bias or exposure. On the basis of epidemiologic findings, evidence shows an association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with occupational EMF exposure although confounding is a potential explanation.

12,Psychiatric disorders (Axis I and Axis II) and self-immolation: a case-control study from Iran,"The objective of this study was to investigate preexisting psychiatric disorders in self-immolation patients. In a case-control study, 30 consecutive cases of deliberate self-inflicted burns, admitted to the regional burn center, were compared with 30 controls. Mental disorders were assessed via detailed clinical interview. Descriptive data revealed that 67% of self-immolation patients had adjustment disorder (all female), 10% drug and alcohol abuse/dependence (all male), 7% dysthymia, 3% major depression, 3% anorexia nervosa, 3% primary insomnia, 7% borderline personality disorder (50% male), 7% depressive personality disorder (100% female), and 3% antisocial personality disorder. In bivariate comparisons, adjustment disorders emerged as related to risk of self-immolation (odds ratio = 13.00). This study suggests that adjustment disorder is a risk factor for self-immolation. As a result, it has been suggested that increasing education about problem-solving approaches, and coping skills for females and at-risk groups are appropriate prevention programs and strategies in Iranian communities.;Burns/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*psychology, Self-Injurious Behavior/*psychology, Adjustment Disorders/epidemiology, Adjustment Disorders/psychology, Adult, Case-Control Studies, Female, Forensic Psychiatry, Humans, Iran, Male, Mental Disorders/epidemiology, Risk Factors, Sex Factors","Ahmadi, Alireza; Mohammadi, Reza; Schwebel, David C; Yeganeh, Naser; Hassanzadeh, Mehdi & Bazargan-Hejazi, Shahrzad",1,12
13,"Early maladaptive schemas of emotional deprivation, social isolation, shame and abandonment are related to a history of suicide attempts among patients with major depressive disorders","Background: Patients with psychiatric disorders have an exceptionally high risk of completed or attempted suicide. This holds particularly true for patients with major depressive disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore whether patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and a history of suicide attempts differed in their early maladaptive schemas from patients with MDD but without such a history or from healthy controls. Method: Ninety participants took part in the study. Of these, 30 were patients with MDD who had made a recent suicide attempt; 30 were patients with MDD but no suicide attempts, and 30 were gender- and age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed questionnaires covering socio-demographic characteristics and the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ- RE2R) to assess early maladaptive schemas. Experts rated patients' MDD with the Montgomeryâ€“Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Results: Patients did not differ in experts' ratings of symptoms of depression. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD recorded higher scores on maladaptive schemas such as recognition seeking, negativity/pessimism, and insufficient self-control. Compared to patients without suicide attempts and healthy controls, those who had made a suicide attempt had higher scores on dimensions such as failure, mistrust, emotional inhibition, social isolation, and abandonment/instability. Conclusion: Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had more pronounced maladaptive schemas, but this was more marked in patients with a history of suicide attempts. The results suggest that suicide attempts and poorer psychological functioning are related.

14,No evidence for metabolic syndrome and lipid profile differences in patients suffering from bipolar I disorder with and without suicide attempts,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to provide further evidence of (1) metabolic syndrome and blood lipid profile differences between suicide attempting and non-attempting patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) I and to assess these differences (2) as a function of acute depressive or manic phase. Methods: Fifty inpatients (mean age: 36.14 years 48% males) with BPD I took part in the study. After recruitment, patients were clustered in four groups: 13 suicide attempters (SAs) assessed during a manic phase, 12 SAs assessed during a depressive phase, 15 non-SAs assessed during a manic phase, and 10 non-SAs assessed during a depressive phase. Body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome, blood pressure, blood lipids (cholesterol, high- and low-density lipids, and triglyceride), and fasting blood sugar were assessed. Results: Neither metabolic syndrome, blood lipid values, fasting blood sugar, nor BMI or blood pressure differed between the SAs and non-SAs, or between patients in an acute manic phase and those in a depressed phase. The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 26.0%. Conclusion: Among patients with BPD I neither the occurrence of metabolic syndrome nor lipid values or fasting blood sugar are reliable biomarkers of suicidal behavior during either acute depressive or manic phase.

15,Major physical health conditions and risk of suicide,"Introduction: Most individuals make healthcare visits before suicide, but many do not have a diagnosed mental health condition. This study seeks to investigate suicide risk among patients with a range of physical health conditions in a U.S. general population sample and whether risk persists after adjustment for mental health and substance use diagnoses. Methods: This study included 2,674 individuals who died by suicide between 2000 and 2013 along with 267,400 controls matched on year and location in a caseâ€“control study conducted in 2016 across eight Mental Health Research Network healthcare systems. A total of 19 physical health conditions were identified using diagnostic codes within the healthcare systemsâ€™ Virtual Data Warehouse, including electronic health record and insurance claims data, during the year before index date. Results: Seventeen physical health conditions were associated with increased suicide risk after adjustment for age and sex (p < 0.001); nine associations persisted after additional adjustment for mental health and substance use diagnoses. Three conditions had a more than twofold increased suicide risk: traumatic brain injury (AOR = 8.80, p < 0.001); sleep disorders; and HIV/AIDS. Multimorbidity was present in 38% of cases versus 15.5% of controls, and represented nearly a twofold increased risk for suicide. Conclusions: Although several individual conditions, for example, traumatic brain injury, were associated with high risk of suicide, nearly all physical health conditions increased suicide risk, even after adjustment for potential confounders. In addition, having multiple physical health conditions increased suicide risk substantially. These data support suicide prevention based on the overall burden of physical health.

16,Monosymptomatic Hypochrondriacal Psychosis (somatic delusional disorder): A report of two cases,"Presents two case reports of monosymptomatic hypochrondriacal psychosis (MHP or somatic delusional disorder); the first, a 29-year-old single woman who presented with a year long history of third person auditory hallucinations, talking and laughing to herself, delusions of reference and a five month history of olfactory hallucinations of bad odor coming from her body and mouth and decline in personal hygiene. She withdrew from social activities, avoided interaction with people (including immediate family members), and stopped attending work She became sad and wished herself dead but never attempted suicide and had no other symptoms suggestive of depressive illness. She was a university graduate and her inability to secure better employment (she was a primary school teacher) four years after her graduation was identified as a major psychosocial stressor that could have precipitated her illness. Her parents sought help from a traditional healer, visited two secondary health facilities, including a dental center and the general out-patient department of our hospital from where she was referred to the psychiatrists. Based on history and examination, she was managed as a case of paranoid schizophrenia (with olfactory reference syndrome) and was treated with haloperidol 15mg daily to which she responded positively after one week. As of when she was seen last in the out-patient clinic, she remained stable on maintenance dose of haloperidol. The second case was a 45-year-old married, Christian saw-miller who presented with a year and a half history of the feeling that insects were crawling all over his body, a mucus substance entering his eyes and a three month history of inadequate sleep The insects were of different sizes and shapes. These insects produced different sensations and were more concentrated on the trunk and the pubic region. He believed that the crawling sensation was a sign that he had contracted Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) because his symptoms started a month after he had sexual intercourse with a female friend. Following this, he stopped having sexual intercourse with his wife because he did not want to transfer the HIV/AIDS infection to her. He was managed as a case of severe depression with psychotic features and delusions of insect infestation as a comorbid disorder. He was treated on an out-patient basis with Amitriptyline and Trifluoperazine. Eleven months after his initial presentation, he was brought by his neighbours on account of poor medication adherence, lack of improvement in his health and serious suicidal intent He was admitted for one month and had six doses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), cognitive and supportive psychotherapy and oral medication He had improved on discharge but a few months later, he defaulted for a year to attempt a religious cure. When he resumed treatment, his condition had deteriorated and his medication was changed to a combination of sertraline and trifluoperazine with minimal improvement. Amitriptyline was recommenced for financial reasons. Despite improvement in sleep and suicidal ideation, the crawling sensation of insects on his body persists. The two cases highlight that MHP can occur in response to, or co-morbid with, a primary psychotic or physical disorder, that it has significant psychosocial impact and causes considerable morbidity and it may not be as rare as presumed.

17,"A mixed state core for melancholia: An exploration in history, art and clinical science","Objective: We argue for a mixed state core for melancholia comparing concepts of melancholia across centuries using examples from art, history and scientific literature. Method: Literature reviews focusing on studies from Kraepelin onward, DSM-IV classification and view-points from clinical experience highlighting phenomenologic and biologic features as predictors of bipolar outcome in prospective studies of depression. Results: Despite the implied chemical pathology in the term endogenous/melancholic depression, frequently reported glucocortical and sleep neurophysiologic abnormalities, there is little evidence that melancholia is inherited independently from more broadly defined depressions. Prospective follow-up of 'neurotic' depressions have shown melancholic outcomes in as many as a third; hypomania has also been observed in such follow-up. Conclusion: These findings and considerations overall do suggest that melancholia as defined today is more closely aligned with the depressive and/or mixed phase of bipolar disorder. Given the high suicidality from many of these patients the practice of treating them with antidepressant monotherapy needs re-evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

18,The dark side of bipolarity: Detecting bipolar depression in its pleomorphic expressions,"The depressive expressions of bipolar disorders have long been neglected. Current data, from both clinical and epidemiologic studies, indicate that such expressions far exceed the manic forms in both cross-section and during follow-up course. Thus, mania occurs in 1% of the population at large; bipolar depression afflicts at least 5 times more people. Much of the new literature on this subject has emphasized its high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. There has been relatively less attention paid to the phenomenology of bipolar depression as it presents clinically. This special issue (volume 84/2-3, 2005) is devoted to a systematic data-based in-depth examination of the different clinical expressions of bipolar depression including, among others, retarded depression, agitated and/or activated depression, mood-labile depression, irritable-hostile depression, atypical depression, anxious depression, depressive mixed state, and resistant depression. Both bipolar I (BP-I), and the more prevalent yet relatively understudied bipolar II (BP-II), are covered. We trust that this extensive coverage of the darker"" side of bipolarity will set the stage for a much needed renaissance in its complex phenotypic expressions--and its delimitation from unipolar depression (UP). The phenomenology of BP-I depression ranges from depressive stupor to agitated psychosis whereas UP depression expresses itself in psychic anxiety and insomnia as well as retardation. BP-II compared with UP is more likely to have atypical features mood lability hostility activation biographical instability multiple anxiety comorbidities suicidal tendencies and to be rated as less ""objectively"" depressed. These findings are complex and do not fully agree with the conventional characterization of BP as retarded and UP as anxious and agitated. The inconsistency between the conventional and the phenomenology described herein is largely due to depressive mixed states which tend to destabilize BP-II and may account for the ""contradictory"" relationships of affect sleep drive and psychomotor activity in mood disorders.

19,Does the FDA proposed list of possible correlates of suicidality associated with antidepressants apply to an adult private practice population?,"Background: In issuing an advisory about a relationship of suicidality emerging during antidepressant use in mood and other psychiatric disorders in juvenile and, possibly patients of all ages, the FDA listed such warning symptomatologic correlates as psychomotor agitation, panic, insomnia, irritability, aggressiveness, and impulsivity, and additionally urged screening for personal and family history for bipolar disorder. It must be recalled that the FDA warning was based on post hoc examination of antidepressant trial data pertaining largely to emergent suicidal ideation rather than attempts. In this report we examine the relevance of the FDA list"" for adults. Methods: Consecutive 650 outpatients presenting with a major depressive episode (MDE) in the second author's (FB) private practice were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV the Hypomania Interview Guide and the Family History Screen. The threshold for a bipolar II (BP-II) diagnosis was broadened by bypassing the stem-A probes on hypomanic mood lowering the duration of hypomanic episodes to as short as 2 days and most importantly eliciting hypomanic intrusions into depressive episodes. Beyond the FDA proposed list and in line with previous work by us we considered symptoms of depressive mixed state (DMX an MDE plus 3 or more DSM-IV intradepressive non-euphoric hypomanic symptoms) as possible substrates for suicidality. Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 49.3% of the sample and significantly greater in BP-II versus MDD (OR = 1.46). Odds ratio for patients with suicidal ideas versus those without suicidal ideas in univariate analyses were as follows: irritability (1.32) psychomotor agitation (1.48) and racing/crowded thoughts (2.0). In DMX irritability was present in 76.4% and in non-DMX in 23.8% (OR = 10.3) psychomotor agitation in 51.3% versus 4.4% (OR = 22.6) and racing/crowded thoughts in 89.2% versus 45.3% (OR = 9.9). Insomnia and family history for bipolarity were not associated with suicidal ideation. Racing/crowded thoughts emerged as the only significant independent predictor in multiple logistic regression. Limitation: Panic was not specifically tested because it was not systematically entered into our clinical database. Furthermore we studied a population which was not taking antidepressants. Our operating hypothesis was that the FDA listed correlates of suicidality are pre-existing baseline substrates that might be potentially further activated by antidepressants. Conclusion: Going beyond previous work by us the present data further refine the ""FDA list"" under scrutiny. While not designed to test whether antidepressants induce suicidality the present report shows that the type of depression associated with suicidal ideas is an agitated irritable and especially mentally overactive syndrome (i.e. a DMX). Bipolarity falling short of the DSM-IV schema (represented by BP-II with brief hypomania and DMX) appears to represent the main diagnostic substrate for the occurrence of suicidality. Although controlled trials of antidepressants in adults have not been specifically conducted in DMX patients it would be clinically prudent to avoid the prescription of antidepressant monotherapy to such patients to avert any potential iatrogenic aggravation of their condition.

20,Validating the bipolar spectrum in the French National EPIDEP Study: Overview of the phenomenology and relative prevalence of its clinical prototypes,"Background: Few studies have been undertaken to ascertain the feasibility of using the bipolar (BP) spectrum in clinical practice. The only systematic national study is the French EPIDEP Study of consecutive inpatients and outpatients presenting with major depressive episodes (MDE). The protocol was developed in 1994 and implemented in 1995; publication of its first data began in 1998. This report provides the complete data set of the EPIDEP. Methods: Forty-eight psychiatrists, practicing in 15 sites in four regions of France (Paris, BesanÃ§on, Bordeaux and Marseille), were all trained on a common protocol based on DSM-IV criteria for MDE (n = 537) subdivided into BP-I (history of mania), BP-II (history of hypomania), as well as extended definitions of the softer spectrum"" beyond BP-I and BP-II. Measures tapping into this spectrum included the Hypomania Checklist (HCA) the cyclothymic (CT) depressive (DT) and hyperthymic (HT) temperament scales. These measures and course permitted post-hoc assignment of MDE in the bipolar spectrum based in part on the Akiskal H. S. Pinto O. 1999. [The evolving bipolar spectrum: Prototypes I II III IV. Psychiatr. Clin. North Am. 22 517-534] proposal: depression with history of spontaneous hypomanic episodes (DSM-IV BP-II) cyclothymic depressions (BP-II1/2) antidepressantassociated hypomania (BP-III) and hyperthymic depressions (BP-IV). ""Strict UP"" was thereby limited to an exclusion diagnosis for the remainder of MDE. Limitation: In the clinical setting psychiatrists cannot be entirely blind to the observations in the various clinical evaluations and instruments. However the systematic multisite collection of such data tended to minimize any such biases. Results: After excluding patients lost to follow-up among 493 presenting with MDE with complete data files the BP-II rate was estimated at index at 20%; 1 month later systematic probing for hypomania doubled the rate of BP-II to 39%. The comparison between BP-II and UP showed differential phenomenology such as hypersomnia increased psychomotor activation guilt feelings and suicidal thoughts in BP-II. Related data demonstrated the importance of CT in further qualifying of MDE to define a distinct more severe (""darker"") BP-II 1/2 variant of BP-II. Moreover BP-III arising from DT and associated with antidepressants emerged as a valid soft bipolar variant on the basis of the phenomenology of hypomania and bipolar family history. Finally we found preliminary evidence for the inclusion of BP-IV into the bipolar spectrum its total hypomania score falling intermediate between BP-II and strict UP. Using this broader diagnostic framework the bipolar spectrum (the combined ""hard"" BP-I phenotype BP-II and the soft spectrum) accounted for 65% of MDE. Conclusion: The EPIDEP study achieved its objectives by demonstrating the feasibility of identifying the bipolar spectrum at a national level and refining its phenomenology through rigorous clinical characterization and validation of bipolar spectrum subtypes including MDE with brief hypomanias cyclothymia and hyperthymia. The spectrumaccounted for two out of three MDE making ""strict UP"" less prevalent than BP as redefined herein.Our findings were anticipated by Falret who in 1854 had predicted thatmanymelancholic patients in the community would 1 day be classified in his circular group. We also confirmed Baillarger's observation in the same year that episodes (in this study hypomanic episodes) could last as short as 2 days. Our findings deriving from a systematic French national database a century and a half later invite major shifts in clinical and public health services as well as in the future conduct of psychopharmacologic trials. In this respect the systematic training of clinicians in four regions of France represents a national resource for affective disorders and can serve as a model to effect change in diagnostic practice in other countries.

21,"Comorbidity structure of psychological disorders in the online e-PASS data as predictors of psychosocial adjustment measures: psychological distress, adequate social support, self-confidence, quality of life, and suicidal ideation","Background: A relative newcomer to the field of psychology, e-mental health has been gaining momentum and has been given considerable research attention. Although several aspects of e-mental health have been studied, 1 aspect has yet to receive attention: the structure of comorbidity of psychological disorders and their relationships with measures of psychosocial adjustment including suicidal ideation in online samples.; Objective: This exploratory study attempted to identify the structure of comorbidity of 21 psychological disorders assessed by an automated online electronic psychological assessment screening system (e-PASS). The resulting comorbidity factor scores were then used to assess the association between comorbidity factor scores and measures of psychosocial adjustments (ie, psychological distress, suicidal ideation, adequate social support, self-confidence in dealing with mental health issues, and quality of life).; Methods: A total of 13,414 participants were assessed using a complex online algorithm that resulted in primary and secondary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnoses for 21 psychological disorders on dimensional severity scales. The scores on these severity scales were used in a principal component analysis (PCA) and the resulting comorbidity factor scores were related to 4 measures of psychosocial adjustments.; Results: A PCA based on 17 of the 21 psychological disorders resulted in a 4-factor model of comorbidity: anxiety-depression consisting of all anxiety disorders, major depressive episode (MDE), and insomnia; substance abuse consisting of alcohol and drug abuse and dependency; body image-eating consisting of eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorders; depression-sleep problems consisting of MDE, insomnia, and hypersomnia. All comorbidity factor scores were significantly associated with psychosocial measures of adjustment (P<.001). They were positively related to psychological distress and suicidal ideation, but negatively related to adequate social support, self-confidence, and quality of life.; Conclusions: This exploratory study identified 4 comorbidity factors in the e-PASS data and these factor scores significantly predicted 5 psychosocial adjustment measures.; Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN121611000704998; http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=336143 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/618r3wvOG).;Suicidal Ideation*, Anxiety Disorders/*psychology, Depressive Disorder, Major/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*psychology, Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology, Adult, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Internet, Male, Quality of Life, Social Support, Stress, Psychological, PD, anxiety disorders, comorbidity, comorbidity factors, comorbidity dimensions, structure of comorbidity, disorders, distress, e-mental health, generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, hypersomnia, major depressive episode, obsessive-compulsive disorder, online therapy, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosocial adjustment, quality of life (QoL), self-confidence, social anxiety disorder, social support, suicidal ideation","Al-Asadi, Ali M; Klein, Britt & Meyer, Denny",1,21
22,Psychiatric Disorders and Montelukast in Children: A Disproportionality Analysis of the VigiBase(Â®),"Introduction: In 2008, the US FDA issued an alert about an increased risk of psychiatric events associated with montelukast. Recent national pharmacovigilance analyses in Sweden, France and Spain detected a potential increase in reporting risk of the association.; Aim: Our objective was to analyse spontaneous reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents worldwide treated with montelukast.; Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) recorded up to 1 January 2015 in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase(Â®)), in which montelukast was associated with 'psychiatric disorders'. We used the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) approach for signal generation.; Results: A total of 14,670 ICSRs for montelukast were recorded, of which 2630 corresponded to psychiatric disorders in people aged <18Â years. The main symptoms reported for infants (aged <2Â years) were sleep disorders, for children (aged 2-11Â years) the main symptoms were depression/anxiety, and for adolescents (aged 12-17Â years) they were suicidal behaviour and depression/anxiety. Suicidal behaviour was over-represented in all age groups with information component (IC) values that reached 5.01 in children and 3.85 in adolescents. Unexpectedly, completed suicides were reported more frequently for children (IC: 3.15; IC025: 1.98) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11; IC025: 2.61) or the total population (IC 1.95; IC025: 1.73).; Conclusions: Neuropsychiatric disorders as side effects of montelukast were more frequently reported for children than for adults. Infants and children seem to be more prone to sleep disturbances, whereas adolescents present symptoms of depression/anxiety and psychotic reactions more often. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide appear to be more frequently reported than previously thought in practice. Risk management plans and epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the risk. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with montelukast use, and should advise the patient and report new cases.; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems*, Acetates/*adverse effects, Anti-Asthmatic Agents/*adverse effects, Mental Disorders/*chemically induced, Quinolines/*adverse effects, Adolescent, Age Factors, Bayes Theorem, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Mental Disorders/epidemiology, Pharmacovigilance, Retrospective Studies, Suicide/statistics & numerical data","Aldea Perona, Ana; GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡iz, Mar & Sanz Ãlvarez, Emilio",0,22
23,Suicide by patients: questionnaire study of its effect on consultant psychiatrists,"Objective: To identify the effect of patients' suicide on consultant psychiatrists in Scotland.; Design: Confidential coded postal questionnaire survey.; Participants: Of 315 eligible consultant psychiatrists, 247 (78%) contributed.; Setting: Scotland.; Main Outcome Measures: Experience of patient suicide; the features and impact of most distressing"" suicide and what helped them to deal with it.; Results: 167 (68%) consultants had had a patient commit suicide under their care. Fifty four (33%) reported being affected personally in terms of low mood poor sleep or irritability. Changes in professional practice were described by 69 (42%) of the psychiatrists-for example a more structured approach to the management of patients at risk and increased use of mental health legislation. Twenty four (15%) doctors considered taking early retirement because of a patient's suicide. Colleagues and family or friends were the best sources of help and team and critical incident reviews were also useful.; Conclusions: Suicide by patients has a substantial emotional and professional effect on consultant psychiatrists. Support from colleagues is helpful and professional reviews provide opportunities for learning and improved management of suicide and its aftermath.;""Accession Number: 10845964. Language: English.

24,Surviving a Suicide Attempt,"Suicide is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world affecting people of all age groups. It has detrimental consequences on patients, their families, and the community as a whole. There have been numerous risk factors described for suicide including mental illness, stressful life situations, loss of social support, and general despair. The association of suicide with Islam has not been extensively studied. The common impression from clinical practice is that being a practicing Muslim reduces the risk of suicide. Another factor associated with suicide is starting a patient on antidepressants. However, this has been questioned recently. This report describes a middle-aged man with depression and multiple social stressors who survived a serious suicide attempt. The discussion will focus on the factors that lead him to want to end his life and the impact of the assumed protective factors such as religious belief and family support on this act of self-harm. Such patients can be on the edge when there is an imbalance between risk factors (such as depression, insomnia, and psychosocial stressors) and protective factors (like religious affiliation and family support). All physicians are advised to assess the suicide risk thoroughly in patients with depression regardless of any presumed protective factor.; Depression, Mental Illness, Oman, Suicide","Al-Harrasi, Ahmed; Al Maqbali, Mandhar & Al-Sinawi, Hamed",0,24
25,Ictal Cardiac Ryhthym Abnormalities,"Cardiac rhythm abnormalities in the context of epilepsy are a well-known phenomenon. However, they are under-recognized and often missed. The pathophysiology of these events is unclear. Bradycardia and asystole are preceded by seizure onset suggesting ictal propagation into the cortex impacting cardiac autonomic function, and the insula and amygdala being possible culprits. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) refers to the unanticipated death of a patient with epilepsy not related to status epilepticus, trauma, drowning, or suicide. Frequent refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures, anti-epileptic polytherapy, and prolonged duration of epilepsy are some of the commonly identified risk factors for SUDEP. However, the most consistent risk factor out of these is an increased frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC). Prevention of SUDEP is extremely important in patients with chronic, generalized epilepsy. Since increased frequency of GTCS is the most consistently reported risk factor for SUDEP, effective seizure control is the most important preventive strategy.; Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, epilepsy, sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP)","Ali, Rushna",0,25
26,Rapid resolution of suicidal behavior and depression with single low-dose ketamine intravenous push even after 6 months of follow-up,"Presents a case report of a 32-year-old Hispanic man with self reported history of depression without previous psychiatric admissions or use of psychotropic medications was admitted for serious suicidal attempt with multiple stab wounds to his neck and upper chest and toxic ingestion of several medications including sedatives and household chemicals. He reported a recent relationship breakup with his friend 3 weeks before presentation and had been driving under intoxication for the fourth time 5 days before the current admission. He endorsed depressive symptoms including feeling low and depressed with feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, decreased interest, disturbed sleep, decreased appetite, and energy lasting for several months, with worsening of these symptoms for 2 to 3 weeks. His laboratory evaluations were unremarkable except for mild complete blood cell abnormalities. Urine toxicology was positive for opiates and tricyclics. Radiologic findings were suggestive of left upper lobe anterior pulmonary laceration, with left-sided hemothorax. A ketamine IV push concentration of 0.5 mg/kg was recommended instead of the conventional dosing administration via infusion over 45 minutes. On the Bipolar Inventory of Signs and Symptoms Scale, the patient reported moderate symptoms of mania, depression and irritability, high anxiety, and no psychosis. Sertraline was then discontinued and the patient was started on a mood stabilizer.

27,Insomnia and suicidal ideation and behaviors in former and current US service members: Does depression mediate the relations?,"Insomnia is a risk factor for Suicidal Ideation (SI) and Behavior (SB), yet the nature of the relations is unclear, including the potential mediating role of cognitive and affective/somatic symptoms of depression. It was hypothesized that the impact of insomnia on SI would be mediated through depressive symptoms and that insomnia would directly impact SB. Current and former military service members (N = 405; M age = 31.6 years, SD = 7.3; 90.4% male, 76.5% White) who endorsed recent suicidal ideation and/or a history of suicide attempt completed measures of insomnia, depression, SI, and SB at baseline and at month 12 follow-up. Mediation models were conducted using structural equation modeling. Significant mediation from insomnia to baseline SI and month 12 SI was found through cognitive/affective depression. Insomnia was directly related to SB occurring between baseline and month 12 follow-up. These findings suggest that cognitive/affective depression mediates the association with SI but not SB. Results build on research showing the importance of depressive symptoms in SI in particular. The direct and indirect pathways from insomnia to SI/SB suggest that clinicians should be aware of these relations when treating patients reporting insomnia.

Method: The PRIDE study is a 15-month, randomized, multicenter study (May 5, 2010, to December 9, 2013) of adult subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia and a history of incarceration. Subjects were randomly assigned to once-monthly paliperidone palmitate injections or daily oral antipsychotics (randomly assigned from 7 acceptable, prespecified oral antipsychotics) for 15 months. The primary end point was time to first treatment failure, defined as arrest/incarceration; psychiatric hospitalization; suicide; treatment discontinuation or supplementation due to inadequate efficacy, safety, or tolerability; or increased psychiatric services to prevent hospitalization. Time to first treatment failure was determined by a blinded event-monitoring board and analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In this study, 450 patients were randomly assigned, and 444 were included in the intent-to-treat population. Paliperidone palmitate was associated with significant delay in time to first treatment failure versus oral antipsychotics (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09-1.88; log rank P = .011). Observed treatment failure rates over 15 months were 39.8% and 53.7%, respectively. Arrest/incarceration and psychiatric hospitalization were the most common reasons for treatment failure in the paliperidone palmitate and oral antipsychotic groups (21.2% vs 29.4% and 8.0% vs 11.9%, respectively). The 5 most common treatment-emergent adverse events for the paliperidone palmitate treatment group were injection site pain (18.6% of subjects), insomnia (16.8%), weight increased (11.9%), akathisia (11.1%), and anxiety (10.6%).

For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) prevent the reuptake of serotonin from the synapse allowing serotonin to remain in the area of activity for a longer period of time but does not correct the lack of serotonin production. Benzodiazepines, such as Valium and XanaxÂ®, stimulate GABA receptors, thus mimicking the calming effects of GABA but again do not fix the lack of GABA production. Often, the brain becomes accustomed to these medications and they often lose their effectiveness, requiring higher doses or different drugs. In contrast to anxiolytic drugs, there are herbs and nutrients which can stimulates neurotransmitter synthesis and more naturally effect and even adjust brain chemistry in the absence of many of the side effects experienced with drugs. Therefore this paper explores several herbal and nutritional approaches to the treatment of anxiety.;Dietary Supplements*, Herbal Medicine*, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use, Animals, Hormones/metabolism, Humans","Alramadhan, Elham; Hanna, Mirna S; Hanna, Mena S; Goldstein, Todd A; Avila, Samantha M & Weeks, Benjamin S",0,34
35,Prevalence and predictors of suicidal behavior among Mongolian high school students,"The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of suicidal behavior among Mongolian high school students. Females were more likely to have suicidal behavior than males. No close friends, feelings of loneliness, insomnia, self perception of underweight or overweight, carrying a weapon were significant predictors of studentsâ€™ suicidal behavior. Missing school without permission, being bullied and going hungry were also important risk factors of suicidal ideation. Families and Schools are important environments to prevent high studentsâ€™ suicide. Improving studentsâ€™ psychological well being, quality of relationship with people, and support resources are critical to prevent suicidal behavior.

36,Mental health literacy: What do Nigerian adolescents know about depression?,"Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability and has been projected to become the 2nd most burdensome disease by the year 2020; depression has also been found to be the strongest single risk factor for attempted or completed suicides. Adolescent-onset mood disorders are frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed and often go untreated. While there is a growing literature on the mental health literacy of adults, there has not been a parallel interest in the mental health literacy of young people in Nigeria. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted among students of a Federal Government College (high school) in south-east Nigeria. All consenting students in the senior secondary classes (grades 10â€“12) were recruited, making a total of 285 participants. The participants were presented with the â€˜friend in needâ€™ questionnaire designed to elicit the participantsâ€™ recognition of the disorder depicted in two vignettes and their recommendation about the appropriate source of help-seeking. One vignette was of a clinically depressed case while the other vignette was about a girl undergoing normal life crisis. Results: Out of the 285 students recruited into the study, 277 questionnaires were adequately completed indicating a response rate of 97.2%. A total of 4.8% (n = 13) participants correctly identified and labelled the depression vignette. Only four respondents (1.5%) recommended professional help from a Psychiatrist or Psychologist. Insomnia was the most identified symptom of distress for depression (17.1%). Females demonstrated higher mental health literacy, in terms of their ability to correctly label the depression vignettes, their expression of greater concern over a depressed peer than males, their expectation that depression requires a longer recovery than normal teenage problems and in their ability to identify individual symptoms of depression. Family and friends were the most recommended source of help. Conclusion: Mental health literacy was abysmally low amongst the adolescents surveyed. Thereâ€™s an urgent need to increase mental health awareness in Nigeria.

37,Association between substance use and psychosocial characteristics among adolescents of the Seychelles,"Background: We examined the associations between substance use (cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and cannabis use) and psychosocial characteristics at the individual and family levels among adolescents of the Seychelles, a rapidly developing small island state in the African region.; Methods: A school survey was conducted in a representative sample of 1432 students aged 11-17 years from all secondary schools. Data came from a self-administered anonymous questionnaire conducted along a standard methodology (Global School-based Health Survey, GSHS). Risk behaviors and psychosocial characteristics were dichotomized. Association analyses were adjusted for a possible classroom effect.; Results: The prevalence of cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and cannabis use was higher in boys than in girls and increased with age. Age-adjusted and multivariate analyses showed that several individual level characteristics (e.g. suicidal ideation and truancy) and family level characteristics (e.g. poor parental monitoring) were associated with substance use among students.; Conclusions: Our results suggest that health promotion programs should simultaneously address multiple risk behaviors and take into account a wide range of psychosocial characteristics of the students at the individual and family levels.;Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology, Marijuana Smoking/*epidemiology, Smoking/*epidemiology, Absenteeism, Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Age Distribution, Child, Child Behavior, Depression/epidemiology, Female, Friends, Humans, Loneliness, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Parents, Sex Distribution, Seychelles/epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Suicidal Ideation, Surveys and Questionnaires","Alwan, Heba; Viswanathan, Bharathi; Rousson, Valentin; Paccaud, Fred & Bovet, Pascal",0,37
38,Review of Remembering Garrett: One family's battle with a child's depression,"Reviews the book, Remembering Garrett: One Family's Battle With a Child's Depression by Gordon H. Smith (2006). Senator Gordon Smith, who has courageously written this candidly wrenching book as a testament to his son Garrett, eloquently states, a child's death is such a painful, 'unnatural' test because something primal within us compels us to believe that we are not supposed to outlive our children. Garrett Smith committed suicide in his apartment practically on the eve of his twenty-third birthday by means of ingesting his prescribed sleeping pills along with a large quantity of whiskey. There are several points of information in Senator Smith's moving account of his son's suicidal history that I found very disquieting. There are also some disquieting facts revealed by Senator Smith regarding the care provided by the eminent psychiatrist mentioned in this book. For example, I found it bewildering to learn that this psychiatrist detected nothing suicidal about Garrett and even later acknowledged that he found him upbeat. This book concludes with an account of Senator Smith's sterling and inspirational work to enact two pieces of legislation.

39,Accessibility and pathways to psychiatric care in a community-based mental health system,"Background: The careful analysis of pathways to specialist mental health care, within the context of community-based services, is important because it allows a detailed understanding of the inter-relationship between the component parts of the whole system of care. Moreover, it permits a comparison of service functioning to made over time, and is one way to operationalise the measurement of accessibility to services. The aims of this study are to describe: (i) the pathways followed by patients with new episodes of care to community-based mental health services, (ii) the time intervals from onset of the problem to first contact with services, and then to onward referral to specialist care (accessibility), and (iii) to explore the short-term costs associated with different pathways.; Methods: Using data from the South-Verona Psychiatric Case Register, all new patients referred to any of the facilities which are part of the South-Verona Community Psychiatric Service (CPS) over a 6-month period (November 1999 - May 2000) were eligible to enter the study. Patients were interviewed by telephone using the Italian translation of the WHO Encounter Form. The costs of care provided in the 3 months following the index contact were assessed for all patients.; Results: The most common route to mental health services is via a GP (40%), followed by a referral from a hospital doctor (26%) and self-referral (23%). The median interval from onset to direct contact with the South-Verona CPS (12 weeks) was shorter than the intervals from onset to direct contact with other service providers (the median interval for contact with GPs and hospital doctors was 24 weeks). The intervals varied considerably from 1 week (for attempted suicide), to 1.5 years (for disturbed behaviour). The results of backward regression modelling revealed a significant relationship between patients' characteristics and community costs or total psychiatric costs (44% and 53% of the variance explained respectively).; Conclusion: When the results are compared with a directly comparable earlier study in South-Verona, it is apparent that between 1991 and 1999 an increasing proportion of patients with insomnia and somatic disorders presented first to GPs, while a decreasing proportion of patients over the years sought care directly from specialist care. An increase in the role of local GPs as gatekeepers has, therefore, emerged. A prompt assessment by the South-Verona CPS of the patients' presenting problems was also confirmed, and this can be explained by the 'drop-in' approach at the Mental Health Centre, where patients can seek specialist care directly, without previously attending GPs. This method of measuring time intervals along pathways is proposed as a way to operationalise accessibility to services in future.;Community Mental Health Services/*trends, Health Services Accessibility/*trends, Mental Disorders/*epidemiology, Referral and Consultation/*trends, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Family Practice/statistics & numerical data, Female, Humans, Italy, Male, Mental Disorders/therapy, Middle Aged, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/therapy, Somatoform Disorders/epidemiology, Somatoform Disorders/therapy, Utilization Review","Amaddeo, F; Zambello, F; Tansella, M & Thornicroft, G",0,39
40,Mental health characteristics and health-seeking behaviors of adolescent school-based health center users and nonusers,"Background: The purpose of this study is to compare the mental health risk profile and health utilization behaviors of adolescent school-based health center (SBHC) users and nonusers and discuss the role that SBHCs can play in addressing adolescent health needs.; Methods: The sample included 4640 students in grades 9 and 11 who completed the California Healthy Kids Survey between fall 2000 and spring 2005 at 4 high schools in Alameda County, California. Chi-squared tests of significance and multivariate logistic regression were used to compare characteristics of SBHC users and nonusers and identify demographic, health status, and behavioral characteristics predictive of SBHC use.; Results: Controlling for demographic variables and general health status, students who reported frequent feelings of sadness, trouble sleeping, suicide ideation, alcohol or marijuana use, the recent loss of a close friend or relationship, or other difficult life event were significantly more likely to seek SBHC services than their peers. Neither health insurance status nor a student's usual"" source of health care was predictive of general SBHC use but being on public assistance or having no insurance was predictive of a student seeking SBHC mental health services.; Conclusions: These findings suggest that SBHCs are able to attract students with the most serious mental health concerns and can play an important role in meeting needs that might otherwise go unmet. The provision of SBHC mental health services in particular may fill a need among adolescents with public or no insurance.; Â© Published 2011.

41,The New Zealand Blood Donors' Health Study: baseline findings of a large prospective cohort study of injury,"Introduction: Cohort studies have contributed important scientific knowledge regarding the determinants of chronic diseases. Despite the need for etiologic investigations, this design has been infrequently used in injury prevention research.; Objectives: To describe the baseline findings of the New Zealand Blood Donors' Health Study, a large prospective study designed to investigate relationships between lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and serious injury due to road crashes, falls, self harm, assault, work, sport, and recreation.; Methods: Participants were recruited from fixed and mobile collection sites of a voluntary non-profit blood donor program. Baseline exposure data (for example risk taking behaviors, alcohol and marijuana use, sleep habits, and depression) were collected using a self administered questionnaire. Outcome data regarding serious injury will be collected prospectively through computerized record linkage of participants' unique identifiers to national morbidity and mortality databases.; Results: In total, 22 389 participants enrolled in the study (81% response rate). The diverse study population included 36% aged 16-24 years, 20% rural residents, and large variability in exposures of interest. For example, in the 12 months before recruitment, 21% had driven a motor vehicle when they considered themselves over the legal limit for alcohol, and 11% had been convicted of traffic violations (excluding parking infringements). Twelve per cent had seriously considered attempting suicide sometime in their life.; Conclusions: This is the first, large scale cohort study investigating determinants of serious injury in New Zealand and among the largest worldwide.

42,The association of psychosocial and familial factors with adolescent suicidal ideation: A population-based study,"We aimed to compare the influence of various parental factors on adolescent suicidal ideas from a population-based sample of 2965 adolescents between 15 to 18 years-old, and their parents. Among the subject variables, gender, satisfaction with one's health, having an illness, and satisfaction with family; and among parental variables, fathers' satisfaction with health; mothers' insufficient sleep; parents' history of suicidal ideation, and satisfaction with family were significantly different in adolescents who reported suicidal ideation compared to those who reported none. Odds ratios indicated increased risk of adolescent suicidal ideation was associated with the subject factors female gender, insufficient sleep, dissatisfaction with one's health, dissatisfaction with family, and with maternal data showing insufficient sleep and a positive history of suicidal impulse. A path analysis model (comparative fit index (CFI)=0.907; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.047), indicated psychosocial factors (Î²=0.232) had a greater influence on adolescent suicidal ideation than did genetic factors (Î²=0.120). These results show psychosocial factors have an almost two-fold greater influence on adolescent suicidal ideation than genetic factors. Assessment and modification of these factors would greatly assist future interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

43,Sedentary Behavior and Sleep Duration Are Associated with Both Stress Symptoms and Suicidal Thoughts in Korean Adults,"Prolonged sedentary time and sleep deprivation are associated with mental health problems such as depression and stress symptoms. Moreover, mental illness is linked with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. However, it is not clear whether sedentary time and sleep duration are associated with stress symptoms and suicidal thoughts independent of physical activity. Thus, our study aimed to identify if sedentary time and sleep duration were associated with both stress symptoms and suicidal thoughts. The participants in present cross-sectional study were 4,674 general Korean adults (1,938 male; 2,736 female), aged â‰¥ 20 years. Prolonged sedentary time (â‰¥ 420 min/day) was significantly associated with the increased risk of stress symptoms (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62) compared with sedentary time of < 240 min/day. The OR for stress symptoms was significant for individuals who had â‰¤ 5 h/day of sleep time (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.48-2.38) compared with sleep duration of â‰¥ 7 h/day. Moreover, prolonged sedentary time (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01-2.42 in â‰¥ 420 min/day vs. < 240 min/day) and short sleep duration (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.17-2.62 in â‰¤ 5 h/day vs. â‰¥ 7 h/day) were significantly associated with an increased risk for suicidal thoughts after adjusting for confounding factors including physical activity. Thus, prolonged sedentary time and sleep deprivation are independently associated with both the risk of stress symptoms and suicidal thoughts. From a public health perspective, reducing sedentary time and improvement of sleep deprivation may serve as an effective strategy for preventing mental illness.; Sedentary Lifestyle*, Sleep*, Suicidal Ideation*, Stress, Psychological/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Activity, Odds Ratio, Risk, Sleep Deprivation/complications, Sleep Deprivation/psychology, Socioeconomic Factors, Stress, Psychological/epidemiology, Young Adult","An, Keun Ok; Jang, Jae Yong & Kim, Junghoon",0,43
44,The U-shaped association between self-reported sleep duration and visual impairment in Korean adults: A population-based study,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between self-reported sleep duration and visual impairment (VI) in Korean adults. Methods: This population-based, cross-sectional study examined ophthalmologic data of 16,374 Koreans aged 19 years and older from the 2010â€“2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES V). VI data (best-corrected distance visual acuity worse than 0.5 logMAR in the better-seeing eye) were obtained from direct ophthalmologic examinations, and data on self-reported sleep duration (â‰¤ 5, 6, 7, 8, or â‰¥ 9 h/night) were obtained using questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between self-reported sleep duration and VI, and we also adjusted for possible covariates. Results: The weighted VI prevalences (95% CIs) were 1.23% (0.70â€“1.76), 0.40% (0.10â€“0.70), 0.18% (0.04â€“0.31), 0.42% (0.26â€“0.58), and 0.66% (0.25â€“1.07) for participants who slept â‰¤ 5, 6, 7, 8, and â‰¥ 9 h/night, respectively. Even after adjusting for demographic factors (age and sex), lifestyle factors (household income, occupation, smoking status, regular exercise, and suicidal thoughts), and medical factors (diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and history of ocular surgery), greater risk of VI was found in the â‰¤ 5 h/night (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.43â€“7.31) and â‰¥ 9 h/night (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.03â€“6.41) groups, compared to the 7 h/night group. Conclusions: In Korean adults, self-reported sleep duration and VI exhibited a U-shaped association. Both very short (â‰¤ 5 h/night) and very long (â‰¥ 9 h/night) sleep durations were significantly associated with increased VI.

45,The synergy of the refugee crisis and the financial crisis in Greece: Impact on mental health,"Background: The current global financial crisis that started in 2008 resulted in a significant decline in global trade, slowing/reversing economic growth worldwide, and a dramatic increase in public sector debt. At the same time, the global migrant/refugee crisis has reached extreme rates, with millions of people being forced to abandon their homes and communities because of war, political violence or related threats. There is a broad consensus about the deleterious consequences of these crises on psychological well-being, depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, alcohol abuse and suicidal behavior. Although the separate consequences of economic recession and immigration are extensively discussed in previous research, we know very little about the processes through which the intersection of economic crisis and migrant crisis contributes to the vulnerabilities of natives and migrants during these crises. Of particular concern is the status of children, adolescents and their families, who constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in society. Aim: To discuss the contexts that economic and migrant crises shape and suggest possible effects of this intersection on mental health risks, especially among children, adolescents and their families, through reflecting on the recent experience in Greece. Method: Review of the literature and critical analysis of the effects of the confluent crises. Conclusion: The interactive effects of these two crises need further exploration. Novel and diverse models of psychological understanding need to be developed in order to manage the effects of the confluent crises. The role of mental health professionals is crucial in this respect, offering culturally flexible, accommodating and empathetic approaches, allowing healing and acceptance in the face of adversity.

46,Exposure to early adversity: Points of cross-species translation that can lead to improved understanding of depression,"The relationship between developmental exposure to adversity and affective disorders is reviewed. Adversity discussed herein includes physical and sexual abuse, neglect, or loss of a caregiver in humans. While these stressors can occur at any point during development, the unique temporal relationship to specific depressive symptoms was the focus of discussion. Further influences of stress exposure during sensitive periods can vary by gender and duration of abuse as well. Data from animal studies are presented to provide greater translational and causal understanding of how sensitive periods, different types of psychosocial stressors, and sex interact to produce depressive-like behaviors. Findings from maternal separation, isolation rearing, chronic variable stress, and peer-peer rearing paradigms clarify interpretation about how various depressive behaviors are influenced by age of exposure. Depressive behaviors are broken down into the following categories: mood and affect, anhedonia, energy, working memory, sleep-wake, appetite changes, suicide, and general malaise. Cross-species evidence from humans, nonhuman primates, rats, and mice within each of these categories is discussed. In conclusion, sensitive periods for affective-related behaviors (anxiety, mood, and controllability) occur earlier in life, while other aspects of depression are associated with adversity later during adolescence.

47,Comorbidities of Atopic Dermatitis: Beyond Rhinitis and Asthma,"Purpose Of Review: In this review article, we summarize the current evidence about atopic dermatitis (AD)-associated comorbidities, beyond the traditional atopic and allergic conditions.; Recent Findings: Patients with AD may have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and neuropsychiatric diseases. The causes of these associations are likely multifactorial and may include genetic predispositions, systemic low-grade inflammation, environmental exposures, medication, and lifestyle and behavioral risk factors. There appears to be geographical variations in prevalence of comorbidities in patients with AD, indicating that differences in ethnicity and lifestyle factors may significantly influence the risk of certain comorbidities.; Summary: The reported comorbidities in recent literature emphasize the burden of disease in patients with AD. Early appropriate AD therapy, in combination with reduction of risk factors, may help prevention of certain comorbidities. The reported observations may generate hypotheses for future investigations in underlying risk factors for AD-associated comorbidities.; Atopic dermatitis, Autoimmune disease, Cancer, Cardiovascular disease, Comorbidities, Neuropsychiatric disease","Andersen, Yuki M.

48,The potential role for emergence in autism,"Although most research on autistic behavior has considered autism categorically, the increasingly apparent genetic and phenotypic complexities of autism are prompting a more dimensional approach to this area. The long-standing interest in a less categorical approach is made clear from a review of literature. The accumulating empirical support for viewing autism-related phenomena as separable and fractionable is outlined and includes data indicating that many of the behaviors occur in isolation in family members and the general population, are not highly correlated within individuals, and appear to be inherited separately. However, it is emphasized that some of the most common and characteristic phenomena observed in individuals diagnosed with autism do not run in their families. It is suggested that these novel, emergent phenomena may arise in the individual from interacting configurations of co-occurring traits or from the interaction of genetic and biological factors underlying the traits. A number of autism-related phenomena including intellectual disability, seizures, persistence of primitive reflexes, stereotypies, self-injurious behavior, savant abilities, and morphological abnormalities, among others, are discussed as potentially being emergent. It is concluded that consideration of the role of emergence in autistic behavior and related phenomena should complement a reductionist approach and might help illuminate the components and complexities of autism.;Accession Number: 19360647.

Analysis showed that (1) Tense Arousal scores correlated positively with overall General Health scores and all General Health factor scores, and Energetic Arousal scores correlated negatively with overall General Health scores and all General Health factor scores except 1; (2) Anxiety and Dysphoria scores predicted Tense Arousal scores, while both Social Dysfunction scores and General Illness scores predicted Energetic Arousal scores; and (3) Ss with high Energetic Arousal scores used a Cognitive-centered more than an Emotional centered coping strategy. Ss with low Energetic Arousal scores used the Emotional-centered coping strategy and have anxiety/dysphoria, while Ss with high Energetic Arousal scores used a Cognitive centered coping strategy and had good health and social activity. Results suggest that there are small but significant relationships among mental health, coping styles, and mood.

50,Serious outcomes associated with overdose of medicines containing barbiturates for treatment of insomnia,"This letter presents a study on serious outcomes associated with overdose of medicines containing barbiturates for treatment of insomnia. The suicide rate has remained high in Japan during the last two decades. Restriction of access to means is an established suicide prevention strategy, and limitation of prescribing barbiturates was followed by decreased death from those drugs in many countries. However, in Japan, many psychiatrists still prescribe medicines containing barbiturates for treatment of insomnia. Authors found that medicines containing barbiturates were overdosed by a substantial proportion of patients in Japan, and it was associated with serious outcomes. This study used the data on a public hospital that covered a wide area of Tokyo, including many psychiatric clinics, thus may reflect a certain trend of prescription of Japanese psychiatrists. Although poisoning of drugs composes less than 5% of all suicide deaths, Japanese psychiatrists should avoid prescription of medicines containing barbiturates for treatment of insomnia. It would also be beneficial for other countries to investigate medicines that cause completed suicide due to drug overdose, and give a caution for easy prescription of those medicines.

51,Antidepressant-Induced Insomnia: Treatment Options,"Discusses the treatment options for antidepressant-induced insomnia. Sleep disorders associated with major depression are heterogeneous and range from hypersomnia to extreme difficulties maintaining sleep. The significance of resolving sleep problems in depressed clients is their potential to produce negative consequences on the quality of life, functional status, and psychiatric and medical comorbidity and treatment outcomes. Depressed individuals successfully treated with various antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, often complain of persistent sleep disturbances. The effects of antidepressants on depression are significant because prolonged sleep problems increase the risk of relapse, recurrence, and suicide, with a need to add on new medications. Assessing depressed clients for antidepressant-induced sleep problems requires astute clinical skills to assess symptoms accurately and implement interventions, such as changing the antidepressant if sleep problems persist and educating clients about sleep-enhancing interventions.

Ss were assessed on subjective symptoms, possible causes, personal relationships and treatment outcomes, and the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and a sleep disturbance questionnaire, at the beginning and end of index admission and after followup. Most Ss suffered from overt anxiety and depressive symptoms at the beginning of hospitalization, which declined significantly during treatment. At the end of the followup period, these symptoms were at the same level as on discharge. Although treatment responses were maintained, Ss often showed suicidal behavior. During followup, Ss differentiated into 2 groups: Those continually fit for work, and those chronically incapable of working.

Many individuals experiencing depression remain untreated due to systemic and personal barriers to care. Guided Internet-based psychotherapeutic programs represent a promising means of overcoming such barriers and increasing the capacity for self-management of depression. However, existing programs tend to be available only in English and can be expensive to access. Furthermore, despite evidence of the effectiveness of a number of Internet-based programs, there is limited evidence regarding both the acceptability of such programs and feasibility of their use, for users and health care professionals.; Objective: This paper will present the protocol for the development, implementation, and evaluation of the iFightDepression tool, an Internet-based self-management tool. This is a cost-free, multilingual, guided, self-management program for mild to moderate depression cases.; Methods: The Preventing Depression and Improving Awareness through Networking in the European Union consortium undertook a comprehensive systematic review of the available evidence regarding computerized cognitive behavior therapy in addition to a consensus process involving mental health experts and service users to inform the development of the iFightDepression tool. The tool was implemented and evaluated for acceptability and feasibility of its use in a pilot phase in 5 European regions, with recruitment of users occurring through general practitioners and health care professionals who participated in a standardized training program.; Results: Targeting mild to moderate depression, the iFightDepression tool is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and addresses behavioral activation (monitoring and planning daily activities), cognitive restructuring (identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts), sleep regulation, mood monitoring, and healthy lifestyle habits. There is also a tailored version of the tool for young people, incorporating less formal language and additional age-appropriate modules on relationships and social anxiety. The tool is accompanied by a 3-hour training intervention for health care professionals.; Conclusions: It is intended that the iFightDepression tool and associated training for health care professionals will represent a valuable resource for the management of depression that will complement existing resources for health care professionals. It is also intended that the iFightDepression tool and training will represent an additional resource within a multifaceted approach to improving the care of depression and preventing suicidal behavior in Europe.; Internet-based, cognitive behavioral therapy, computerized, depression, primary care, self-management","Arensman, Ella; Koburger, Nicole; Larkin, Celine; Karwig, Gillian; Coffey, Claire; Maxwell, Margaret; Harris, Fiona; Rummel-Kluge, Christine; van Audenhove, Chantal; Sisask, Merike; Alexandrova-Karamanova, Anna; Perez, Victor; Purebl, GyÃ¶rgy; Cebria, Annabel; Palao, Diego; Costa, Susana; Mark, Lauraliisa; TÃ³th, MÃ³nika Ditta; Gecheva, Marieta; IbelshÃ¤user, Angela; GusmÃ£o, Ricardo & Hegerl, Ulrich",0,54
55,Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of depression-related phenomena,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is one research method increasingly employed to better understand the processes that underpin depression and related phenomena. In particular, EMA is well suited to the study of affect (e.g., positive and negative affect), affective responses to stress (e.g., emotion reactivity), and behaviors (e.g., activity level, sleep) that are associated with depression. Additionally, EMA can provide insights into self-harm behavior (i.e. suicide and non-suicidal self-injury), and other mood disorders (e.g. bipolar disorder) commonly associated with depressive episodes. Given the increasing availability and affordability of handheld computing devices such as smartphones, EMA is likely to play an increasingly important role in the study of depression and related phenomena in the future.; ","Armey, Michael F.; Schatten, Heather T.; Haradhvala, Natasha & Miller, Ivan W.",0,55
56,The effects of antidepressants on sleep in patients with depression,"Reviews sleep disturbances in patients with major depressive disorders and the effects of different classes of antidepressants on sleep. The findings from the studies reviewed show that not all antidepressants improve sleep, and, indeed, some worsen sleep disturbances in patients with depression. Whether sleep is improved or further disrupted is of clinical significance, because persistent sleep problems elevate the risk of relapse, recurrence, or suicide, as well as the need for augmenting medications.

57,"Sleep Problems, Suicidality and Depression among American Indian Youth","Study Background: Mental health and sleep problems are important public health concerns among adolescents yet little is known about the relationship between sleep, depressive symptoms, and suicidality among American Indian youth.; Methods: This study examined the impact of sleep and other factors on depressive symptoms and suicidality among Lumbee American Indian adolescents (N=80) ages 11-18.; Results: At the bivariate level, sleepiness, was associated with depression but not with suicidality. Time in bed (TIB) was not associated with depression, but more TIB decreased the likelihood of suicidality. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with increased likelihood of suicidality. At the multivariate level, sleepiness, suicidality, and self-esteem were associated with depression. TIB and depressive symptoms were the only variables associated with suicidality.; Conclusion: In working with American Indian youth, it may be helpful to consider sleep patterns as part of a comprehensive assessment process for youth who have or are at risk for depression and suicide.; Adolescents, American indians, Depression, Sleep problems, Suicide","Arnold, Elizabeth Mayfield; McCall, Vaughn W.; Anderson, Andrea; Bryant, Alfred & Bell, Ronny",1,57
58,Health attitudes and suicidal ideation among university students,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine whether positive health attitudes are associated with suicidal ideation among university students after accounting for other health risk factors linked to suicidal ideation. Participants: Participants were 690 undergraduates from a large midwestern university during fall semester 2011. Methods: Participants reported demographics and health characteristics. Regression models compared individuals who reported suicidal ideation and those who did not. Results: In unadjusted models, suicidal ideation was significantly negatively associated with positive health attitudes, and positively associated with depression, drug use problems, sleep problems, and being overweight. In adjusted models, more positive health attitudes continued to be significantly negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Conclusions: This study suggests a link between positive health attitudes and lower probability of suicidal ideation. Additional research is needed to assess enhancing general health attitudes as a suicide prevention effort.

59,Forced sex: A critical factor in the sleep difficulties of young Australian women,"The prevalence of forced sex and its contribution to sleep difficulties among young Australian women aged 24-30 years (n = 9,061) was examined using data from the 2003 Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health. The lifetime prevalence of reported forced sex was 8.7%. Significantly higher levels of recurrent sleep difficulties, prescription sleep medication, clinical depression, anxiety disorder, self-harm, and substance use, as well as lower socioeconomic status (SES) indicators, were reported by the forced sex group compared to the no forced sex group. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed the high odds (OR = 1.95, CI = 1.66-2.26) of recurrent sleep difficulty in such women becomes partially attenuated, but remains statistically significant, after adjusting for key psychological, SES, and behavioral variables. Clinical implications for primary care providers and sleep specialists are discussed. Sleep difficulties are highly prevalent and affect more than 30% of those seeking primary health care (Kushida et al., 2005). They negatively impact on the way a person feels and functions (Dinges et al., 1997) and make a significant contribution to accidents, health care costs, and problems at work (Roth, 2005).

60,Risks of high-dose stimulants in the treatment of disorders of excessive somnolence: A case-control study,"Study Objectives: To ascertain complications associated with high-dose stimulant therapy in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Design: Case-control, retrospective chart review. Setting: Sleep center in an academic hospital. Patients: 116 patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia were individually matched by sex, diagnosis, age of onset, and duration of follow-up from both onset and diagnosis. Members of the high-dose group (n = 58) had received at least 1 stimulant at a dosage â‰¥120% of the maximum recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Standards of Practice Committee. The standard-dose control group (n = 58) had received stimulants at a dosage â‰¤100% of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: The prevalence of psychosis (odds ratio = 12.0 [1.6-92.0]), alcohol or polysubstance misuse (odds ratio = 4.3 [1.2-15.2]), and psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratio = 3.2 [1.1-10.0]) was significantly increased in the high-dose group. More high-dose patients also experienced tachyarrhythmias (odds ratio = 3.3 [0.92-12.1] and anorexia or weight loss (odds ratio = 11.0 [1.4-85.2]). The frequency of physician-diagnosed depression, drug-seeking and suicide-related behaviors, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a significantly higher occurrence of psychosis, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalizations in patients using high-dose stimulants compared to those using standard doses. Tachyarrhythmias and anorexia or weight loss were also more common in this group as compared with controls. Clinicians should be very cautious in prescribing dosages that exceed maximum guidelines.

61,Polysomnographic features of early-onset depression: A meta-analysis,"Background: Undiagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with increased morbidity in children and adolescents. This study evaluated features of sleep macro- and microarchitecture assessed by polysomnography (PSG) as diagnostic markers for MDD in children and adolescents. Methods: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE and PUBMED were searched from their availability dates to March 1st, 2013. The literature search identified 932 abstracts of which 51 studies were retrieved and 28 were included in the analysis. Study design, features of sleep macro- and microarchitecture, demographic and clinical characteristics of study groups were extracted for each study. Results: There were modest differences on sleep macroarchitecture between children and adolescents with MDD and healthy controls. The most robust difference was found in sleep latency, 31% of adolescents with MDD had increased sleep latency. Age, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and psychiatric comorbidities were significant predictors of sleep macroarchitecture. Modest differences were found for sleep microarchitecture, intrahemispheric and interhemispheric temporal coherence was decreased in a third of patients with MDD. Age was a significant predictor of sleep microarchitecture. Limitations: This meta-analysis is limited by the small number of studies on sleep macroarchitecture in children with MDD and studies on sleep microarchitecture overall and by the heterogeneity in methodology between studies. Conclusions: This synthetic review of the existing literature is among the largest to quantitatively assess impaired sleep as a diagnostic marker for MDD in children and adolescents. Knowledge of sleep macro- and microarchitecture in early-onset MDD may aid the clinician in developing a treatment strategy for MDD-related sleep symptoms in a subset of patients.

62,"A suicidal adolescent's Sleeping Beauty syndrome: Cessation orientations toward dying, sleep, and drugs","Analyzed the account of a 16-yr-old girl, diagnosed as schizophrenic, to gain insight into a family's role in the suicidal career of an adolescent preoccupied with death and dying, sleep, and drugs; the interplay of her construction of reality with her risk-taking, self-injurious way of life; and her perceived problems of living and need for help. Her cessation orientation revealed a kind of Sleeping Beauty syndrome with fantasies on sleep, drugs, and death, including a death of the mind from overdosing.

63,Psychosocial perspective and suicidal behaviors correlated with adolescent male smoking and illicit drug use,"Objectives: To assess the prevalence of smoking and drug use among adolescent boys, and to examine adolescents' psychosocial factors, and suicidal behaviors associated with adolescents' substance use.; Methods: The Kuwait Global School-Based Student Health Survey employed a two-stage cluster sample design targeting a representative sample of adolescents. This study focused on the participated 1310 boys. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, student t-test, and multivariate analysis.; Results: The mean age was 14.5â€‰Â±â€‰0.03 years. The reported prevalence of: smoking, ever drug use, and both smoking and drug use were 26.6% (95% CI:24.2-29.1%) and 7.4% (95% CI:6.1-9.0%) and 5.5% (95% CI:4.4-6.9%) respectively. Logistic regression model analysis revealed that adolescents whose parents smoke, suffered from insomnia, were victims of bullying, and had negative social school environment, were more likely than others to be smokers, drug users or both. Addendum, suicidal ideation, and its combination with suicidal planning and/or suicidal attempt were significantly associated with smoking. The odds of these life-threatening behaviors increased when drug use was reported and augmented when both smoking and drug use were experienced.; Conclusions: Prevalence of smoking and illicit drug use were high among adolescent boys. This study confirmed the association between adolescents' smoking and substance use with psychosocial context, and suicidal behaviors. Addressing these predictors would be crucial in the development of effective strategies targeting the prevention of smoking and substance use, which might consequently reduce suicidal behaviors among adolescents.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

64,Risk factors for suicidal ideation of the general population,"The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors of suicide ideation in general population. A total of 1,116 adults were sampled with randomization in an urban area. After excluding 116 participants due to incomplete answer, 1,000 participants (500 males; mean age 39.6 Â± 11.6) completed self-report questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CES-D), the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), and questions on weekday sleep duration. Results showed higher scores on the BSI were related with higher scores on the STAXI, CES-D, a family history of psychiatric illness, and short or long sleep duration (â‰¤ 5 or â‰¥ 10 hr) (adjusted R (2) = 0.151, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.008, respectively). The predictive power of the STAXI scores, the presence of psychiatric family history and short or long sleep duration was stronger in the high CES-D group with scores of 16 or higher (adjusted R (2) = 0.275, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). These findings suggest that suicide idea in general population may be related with the presence of family history for psychiatric illness, depressive mood, high anger and short or long sleep duration.;Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Anger, Depression/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Sleep, Suicidal Ideation, Surveys and Questionnaires, General Population, Risk Factor, Suicide Idea","Bae, Seung-Min; Lee, Yu Jin; Cho, In Hee; Kim, Seog Ju; Im, Jeong Soo & Cho, Seong-Jin",1,64
65,General and comparative efficacy and effectiveness of antidepressants in the acute treatment of depressive disorders: a report by the WPA section of pharmacopsychiatry,"Current gold standard approaches to the treatment of depression include pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions with social support. Due to current controversies concerning the efficacy of antidepressants in randomized controlled trials, the generalizability of study findings to wider clinical practice and the increasing importance of socioeconomic considerations, it seems timely to address the uncertainty of concerned patients and relatives, and their treating psychiatrists and general practitioners. We therefore discuss both the efficacy and clinical effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of depressive disorders. We explain and clarify useful measures for assessing clinically meaningful antidepressant treatment effects and the types of studies that are useful for addressing uncertainties. This includes considerations of methodological issues in randomized controlled studies, meta-analyses, and effectiveness studies. Furthermore, we summarize the differential efficacy and effectiveness of antidepressants with distinct pharmacodynamic properties, and differences between studies using antidepressants and/or psychotherapy. We also address the differential effectiveness of antidepressant drugs with differing modes of action and in varying subtypes of depressive disorder. After highlighting the clinical usefulness of treatment algorithms and the divergent biological, psychological, and clinical efforts to predict the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments, we conclude that the spectrum of different antidepressant treatments has broadened over the last few decades. The efficacy and clinical effectiveness of antidepressants is statistically significant, clinically relevant, and proven repeatedly. Further optimization of treatment can be helped by clearly structured treatment algorithms and the implementation of psychotherapeutic interventions. Modern individualized antidepressant treatment is in most cases a well-tolerated and efficacious approach to minimize the negative impact of otherwise potentially devastating and life-threatening outcomes in depressive disorders.; Psychotherapy*, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder/*rehabilitation, Drug Interactions, Humans, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome","Baghai, Thomas C.; Blier, Pierre; Baldwin, David S.; Bauer, Michael; Goodwin, Guy M.; Fountoulakis, Kostas N.; Kasper, Siegfried; Leonard, Brian E.; Malt, Ulrik F.; Stein, Dan; Versiani, Marcio & MÃ¶ller, Hans-JÃ¼rgen",0,65

The ADRs assessed as serious were confirmed from regular review of the medical records.; Measurements and Main Results: A total of 87 patients were treated for HCV. Among these, peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy was started in 51 patients; one patient was lost to follow-up after 1 month. The ADRs were assessed as serious in 10 patients (20%): suicide (one patient), hospitalization (three patients), and definitive discontinuation of peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin (six patients). The ADRs contributed to or were the main reason for withdrawing HCV drugs in 8 patients (16%). Dosage reductions of ribavirin and/or peginterferon alfa-2b were required in 10 patients (20%) and seemed less frequent than that needed in clinical trials. Compared with results of clinical trials, a similar frequency of hair loss, higher frequency of injection-site reactions, lower frequency of depression or insomnia, and higher frequency of endocrine ADRs or blurred vision were detected.; Conclusion: Results suggest some differences in the frequencies of ADRs compared with data from clinical trials.

67,Investigating the association between age at first alcohol use and suicidal ideation among high school students: Evidence from the youth risk behavior surveillance system,"Background: Although various studies have investigated and found a significant link between age at first alcohol use and health risk behaviors, few studies have investigated the effect of age at first alcohol use on suicidal ideation among adolescents. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of age at first alcohol use on suicidal ideation. Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance system. A sample of 10,745 adolescents aged 14â€“18 years (50.9% males) were analyzed using logistic regression with suicidal ideation as the outcome variable and age at first alcohol use as the main explanatory variable. Results: About 17% of adolescents experienced suicidal ideation during the past 12 months and 15.6% started having alcohol before age 13. Adolescents who started having alcohol before age 13 had 1.60 times higher odds of experiencing suicidal ideation and adolescents who started having alcohol by age 13 or over had 1.47 times higher odds of experiencing suicidal ideation. Other significant factors associated with suicidal ideation include experience of forced sex, physical teen dating violence, bullying, and feeling sad or hopeless. Having sufficient sleep lowered the odds of suicidal ideation. Limitations: The use of cross-sectional data limits the extent to which we can make causal claims regarding age at first alcohol use and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Younger age at first alcohol use was associated with increased likelihood of suicidal ideation. Public health initiatives that seek to address the co-occurring problems of alcohol use and mental health illness, sexual violence, and victimization among sexual minority youth could help in reducing suicidal ideation.

Most individuals remain asymptomatic or symptoms quickly resolve, but in a minority intrusive imagery and nightmares, emotional numbing and avoidance, and hyperarousal persist for decades. PTSD is associated with psychiatric and medical co-morbidities, increased risk for suicide, and with poor social and occupational functioning. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are common treatments. Whereas, research supports the efficacy of the cognitive behavioral psychotherapies, there is insufficient evidence to unequivocally support the efficacy of any specific pharmacotherapy. Proven effective pharmacologic agents are sorely needed to treat core and targeted PTSD symptoms, and for prevention.

70,Preventing late-life depression: A clinical update,"Background: Achieving remission in late-life depressive disorder is difficult; it is far better to prevent depression. In the last ten years there have been a number of clinical studies of the feasibility of prevention. Methods: A limited literature review was undertaken of studies from 2000 specifically concerning the primary prevention of late-life depressive disorder or where primary prevention is a relevant secondary outcome. Results'. Selective primary prevention (targeting individuals at risk but not expressing depression) has been shown to be effective for stroke and macular degeneration but not hip fracture. It may also prove effective for the depression associated with caregiving in dementia. Emerging evidence finds effectiveness for indicated prevention (in those identified with subthreshold depression often with other risk factors such as functional limitation). Despite a number of promising risk factors (for example, diet, exercise, vascular risk factors, homocysteine and insomnia), universal prevention of late-life depression (acting to reduce the impact of risk factors at the population level) has no current evidence base, although a population approach might mitigate suicide. Conclusion: Interventions which work in preventing late-life depression include antidepressant medication in standard doses and Problem-Solving Treatment. When integrated into a care model, such as collaborative care, prevention is feasible but more economic studies are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Using information derived from the diagnostic interview and a self-report assessment of mood spectrum symptoms, subjects were assigned to 3 categories according to the maximum level of suicidality achieved in the lifetime (none, ideation/plans, and suicide attempts). The association of categorical and continuous variables with suicidality levels was investigated using multinomial logistic regression models.; Results: Suicidal ideation and plans were more common in unipolar depression (50%) and bipolar disorder (42.4%) than in borderline personality disorder (30%), whereas the reverse was true for suicidal attempts. In each of the study groups, the number and the type of mood spectrum items endorsed, including depressive and manic-hypomanic items and rhythmicity and vegetative symptoms, were associated with increased levels of suicidality.; Conclusions: Our results suggest that the assessment of lifetime rhythmicity and manic-hypomanic features may be clinically useful to identify potential suicide attempters in high-risk groups.;Seasons*, Weather*, Mood Disorders/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Adult, Case-Control Studies, Feeding Behavior, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Mental Disorders/psychology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Retrospective Studies, Sleep","Balestrieri, Matteo; Rucci, Paola; Sbrana, Alfredo; Ravani, Laura; Benvenuti, Antonella; Gonnelli, Chiara; Dell'osso, Liliana & Cassano, Giovanni B",1,71
72,Khat - a controversial plant,"Khat (Catha edulis) is a shrub or tree whose leaves have been chewed for centuries by people who live in the Eastern part of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It has recently turned up in North America and Europe, particularly among emigrants and refugees from countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia and Yemen. Khat contains a number of chemicals, among which are two controlled substances, cathinone (Schedule I) and cathine (Schedule IV). Both chemicals are stimulant drugs with effects similar to amphetamine. Chewing the leaves makes people feel more alert and talkative, and suppresses appetite. Chewing khat leaves releases cathinone, a stimulant that produces the feeling of euphoria. When cathinone is broken down in the body, it produces chemicals including cathine and norephedrine, which have a similar structure to amphetamine and adrenaline (epinephrine). Regular khat use is associated with a rise in arterial blood pressure and pulse rate, corresponding with levels of cathinone in the plasma. Moreover, regular khat chewers have gingivitis and loose teeth, but there appears to be no convincing unusual incidence of oral cancer. Among khat users in Yemen there is, however, a higher incidence of esophageal cancer compared with gastric cancer. Long term use or abuse can cause insomnia, anorexia, gastric disorders, depression, liver damage and cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction. Manic and delusional behavior, violence, suicidal depression, hallucinations, paranoia and khat-induced psychosis have also been reported. On the basis of the scientific data it seems clear that khat use has negative consequences on the economic development of a country and on the health of the society.;Catha/*adverse effects, Esophageal Neoplasms/*chemically induced, Hypertension/*chemically induced, Mental Disorders/*chemically induced, Plant Extracts/*adverse effects, Humans, Risk Assessment","Balint, Erica E; Falkay, George & Balint, Gabor A",0,72
73,Nocturnal Wakefulness Is Associated With Next-Day Suicidal Ideation in Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder,"Objective: Self-reported sleep disturbances may confer elevated risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death. However, limited research has evaluated polysomnographically determined sleep disturbance as an acute physiologic risk factor for suicidal thoughts. This study sought to investigate the relationship between nocturnal wakefulness in association with next-day suicidal ideation using overnight polysomnography assessment from data collected between 2006 and 2013.; Methods: Sixty-five participants with DSM-IV-diagnosed major depressive disorder or bipolar depression underwent overnight polysomnography monitoring in a sleep laboratory. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was administered the morning after polysomnography recording to assess next-day suicidal ideation, severity of depressive symptoms, and subjective sleep disturbances.; Results: Using a generalized linear mixed model, a significant time-by-ideation interaction was found indicating greater nocturnal wakefulness at 4:00 am among participants with suicidal ideation (F4,136 = 3.65, P = .007). Increased time awake during the 4:00 am hour (4:00 to 4:59) was significantly associated with elevated suicidal thoughts the next day (standardized Î² = 0.31, P = .008). This relationship persisted after controlling for age, gender, diagnosis, and severity of depressive symptoms.; Conclusions: Greater nocturnal wakefulness, particularly in the early morning hours, was significantly associated with next-day suicidal thoughts.

Psoriasis is associated with a variety of psychological problems, including poor self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.; Objectives: We aimed to investigate general psychiatric symptoms, quality of sleep, and coping strategies in patients with psoriasis vulgaris.; Methods: A total of 79 subjects (37 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 42 control subjects) were enrolled in the study. Coping strategies were measured using the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced (COPE) Scale. General psychopathological status was assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL90R), and sleep quality and disturbances were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).; Results: The mean age of the patients was 39.18Â Â±Â 16.85Â years. The mean age of control subjects was 39.33Â Â±Â 11.61Â years. The mean score on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was 7.56Â Â±Â 3.66. There were no significant differences in scores on the SCL90R and COPE subscales between the patient and control groups. However, significant differences between the groups emerged on the PSQI subscales for subjective sleep quality and habitual sleep efficiency (ZÂ =Â -1.964, PÂ =Â 0.049, and ZÂ =Â -2.452, PÂ =Â 0.014, respectively).; Conclusions: The present study found no significant differences in general psychiatric symptoms and coping strategies between the psoriasis patients and the control group, by contrast with findings reported elsewhere in the literature. We think that the low PASI scores of our patients, which indicate the low severity of disease in the present group, is the main reason for this finding. However, sleep quality is lower in psoriasis vulgaris patients than in healthy controls. This may be associated with the itch and pain caused by lesions. Further experimental studies are required to explain these findings.; Â© 2015 The International Society of Dermatology.Adaptation, Psychological*, Quality of Life*, Depressive Disorder/*psychology, Psoriasis/*psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/*psychology, Adult, Age Factors, Case-Control Studies, Chi-Square Distribution, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/epidemiology, Female, Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Psoriasis/diagnosis, Psoriasis/epidemiology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reference Values, Risk Assessment, Severity of Illness Index, Sex Factors, Sickness Impact Profile, Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology, Young Adult","Balta, Ilknur; Karadag, Ayse S.; Selek, Salih; Onder, Sevda; Kanbay, Asiye & Burakgazi-Yilmaz, Hatice",1,74
75,Poor sleep associates with recent nonsuicidal self-injury engagement in adolescents,"Objective/Background: Poor sleep has been shown to have multiple negative outcomes during adolescence, in both academic and mental health domains. Several studies have identified the association between poor sleep and suicide risk in adolescents. However, onset of and engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is also common in this age group, but this behavior has rarely been studied in association with sleep in adolescent samples. In the current study, it was expected that poorer sleep and more symptoms of insomnia would associate with a greater likelihood of recent NSSI engagement and greater NSSI severity. Participants: Data were collected from 387 community adolescents (mean age = 14.19, SD = 1.08), 9% of whom reported NSSI in the past 6 months. The gender breakdown was about even (52% female) and the majority of the sample was White (88.5%). Methods: Adolescent participants were recruited from middle and high schools for a study on mental health and risk behaviors. Researchers visited schools and administered self-report questionnaires to students in large groups. Measures assessed NSSI engagement and severity features, overall sleep quality, and insomnia symptoms. Results: Results indicated that greater insomnia symptoms, but not overall sleep quality, were significantly associated with greater likelihood of recent NSSI engagement. Sleep variables were not significantly associated with NSSI severity among adolescents with recent NSSI. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms seem to be associated with recent engagement in NSSI. Adolescents who report symptoms of insomnia should also be assessed for self-harm behavior.

76,The stress system in depression and neurodegeneration: Focus on the human hypothalamus,"The stress response is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Activity of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) forms the basis of the activity of the HPA-axis. The CRH neurons induce adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) release from the pituitary, which subsequently causes cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. The CRH neurons co-express vasopressin (AVP) which potentiates the CRH effects. CRH neurons project not only to the median eminence but also into brain areas where they, e.g., regulate the adrenal innervation of the autonomic system and affect mood. The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system is also involved in stress response. It releases AVP from the PVN and the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and oxytocin (OXT) from the PVN via the neurohypophysis into the bloodstream. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hypothalamic clock, is responsible for the rhythmic changes of the stress system. Both centrally released CRH and increased levels of cortisol contribute to the signs and symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression can be induced in experimental animals by intracerebroventricular injection of CRH. Depression is also a frequent side effect of glucocorticoid treatment and of the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. The AVP neurons in the hypothalamic PVN and SON are also activated in depression, which contributes to the increased release of ACTH from the pituitary. Increased levels of circulating AVP are also associated with the risk for suicide. The prevalence, incidence and morbidity risk for depression are higher in females than in males and fluctuations in sex hormone levels are considered to be involved in the etiology. About 40% of the activated CRH neurons in mood disorders co-express nuclear estrogen receptor (ER)-Î± in the PVN, while estrogen-responsive elements have been found in the CRH gene promoter region, and estrogens stimulate CRH production. An androgen-responsive element in the CRH gene promoter region initiates a suppressing effect on CRH expression. The decreased activity of the SCN is the basis for the disturbances of circadian and circannual fluctuations in mood, sleep and hormonal rhythms found in depression. Neuronal loss was also reported in the hippocampus of stressed or corticosteroid-treated rodents and primates. Because of the inhibitory control of the hippocampus on the HPA-axis, damage to this structure was expected to disinhibit the HPA-axis, and to cause a positive feedforward cascade of increasing glucocorticoid levels over time. This 'glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis' of stress and hippocampal damage was proposed to be causally involved in age-related accumulation of hippocampal damage in disorders like Alzheimer's disease and depression. However, in postmortem studies we could not find the presumed hippocampal damage of steroid overexposure in either depressed patients or in patients treated with synthetic steroids.

77,"Corrected QT interval prolongation after an overdose of escitalopram, morphine, oxycodone, zopiclone and benzodiazepines","Escitalopram is the recently marketed S-enantiomer of the widely used antidepressant citalopram. Data from intentional overexposure to this medication are limited. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) effects from racemic citalopram have been described; however, the present report is the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, that describes all the reported abnormalities in a single patient receiving escitalopram. A 52-year-old man with a history of depression treated with escitalopram 10 mg/day, extended-release morphine 30 mg/day and zopiclone 15 mg/day was found unconscious at his home. He was known to have attempted suicide three weeks previously. Partially emptied bottles of escitalopram, morphine, oxycodone, zopiclone, lorazepam and diazepam were found close to the patient. He was transferred to the emergency department, where airway management and other supportive care were initiated. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The initial 12-lead ECG demonstrated junctional rhythm at 48 beats/min, a wide complex escape (145 ms) with right bundle branch morphology and a prolonged corrected QT interval at 650 ms. Cardiac monitoring was undertaken. No ventricular arrhythmias or torsade de pointes were detected. No specific treatment for shortening the QT was implemented. Another 12-lead ECG performed 48 h later demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a normal corrected QT, normal PR interval and normal QRS duration.

78,Antidepressant dose and the risk of deliberate self-harm,"Although the mechanism by which antidepressants (ADs) may increase the risk of suicide-related outcomes is unknown, it has been hypothesised that some adverse effects, including akathisia, insomnia and panic attacks, as well as an early energising effect that might allow patients with depression to act on suicidal impulses, may have a key role. Considering that these adverse effects are dose-related, it might be hypothesised that the risk of suicidal behaviour is similarly related to the AD dose. This research question has recently been addressed by a propensity score-matched observational cohort study that involved 162 625 patients aged 10-64 years with a depression diagnosis who initiated therapy with citalopram, sertraline or fluoxetine. In this commntary, we discuss the main findings of this study in view of its methodological strengths and limitations, and we suggest possible implications for day-to-day clinical practice.

79,Oral Cannabidiol Use in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder to Treat Related Symptoms and Co-morbidities,"Objective: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly exhibit comorbid symptoms such as aggression, hyperactivity and anxiety. Several studies are being conducted worldwide on cannabidiol use in ASD; however, these studies are still ongoing, and data on the effects of its use is very limited. In this study we aimed to report the experience of parents who administer, under supervision, oral cannabinoids to their children with ASD. Methods: After obtaining a license from the Israeli Ministry of Health, parents of children with ASD were instructed by a nurse practitioner how to administer oral drops of cannabidiol oil. Information on comorbid symptoms and safety was prospectively recorded biweekly during follow-up interviews. An independent group of specialists analyzed these data for changes in ASD symptoms and drug safety. Results: 53 children at a median age of 11 (4-22) year received cannabidiol for a median duration of 66 days (30-588). Self-injury and rage attacks (n = 34) improved in 67.6% and worsened in 8.8%. Hyperactivity symptoms (n = 38) improved in 68.4%, did not change in 28.9% and worsened in 2.6%. Sleep problems (n = 21) improved in 71.4% and worsened in 4.7%. Anxiety (n = 17) improved in 47.1% and worsened in 23.5%. Adverse effects, mostly somnolence and change in appetite were mild. Conclusion: Parents' reports suggest that cannabidiol may improve ASD comorbidity symptoms; however, the long-term effects should be evaluated in large scale studies.; ASD comorbid symptoms, ASD treatment, THC â€“ tetrahydrocannabinol, autism spectrum disorder, cannabidiol, clinical research trial, pediatrics","Barchel, Dana; Stolar, Orit; De-Haan, Tal; Ziv-Baran, Tomer; Saban, Naama; Fuchs, Danny Or; Koren, Gideon & Berkovitch, Matitiahu",0,79
80,The impact of sleep duration on adolescent development: A genetically informed analysis of identical twin pairs,"Recent work provides evidence that reduced sleep duration has detrimental effects on a range of developmentally related outcomes during adolescence. Yet, the potential confounding influence of genetic and shared environmental effects has not been sufficiently addressed. This study addresses this issue by analyzing cross-sectional data from the twin sub-sample of the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [N â‰ˆ 287 MZ (monozygotic) twin pairs; 50 % male; 22 % Black; mean age = 15.75]. Associations between sleep duration (measured through two different strategies, one tapping number of hours slept at night and the other measuring weeknight bedtimes) and seven outcomes (self-control, depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, body mass index, violent delinquency, non-violent delinquency, and drug use) were estimated. Consistent with prior research, associations between sleep duration and several outcomes were statistically significant when using standard social science analytic methods. Yet, when employing a methodology that accounts for genetic and shared environmental influences, some of these associations were reduced to non-significance. Still, two consistent associations remained in that participants who reported sleeping fewer hours at night (or who reported later bedtimes) exhibited lower levels of self-control and more depressive symptoms. Implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

82,Understanding mental health among military veterans in the fire service,"Firefighters who have previously served in the military may be at potentially higher risk for worsened mental health outcomes. This investigation examined the mental health of military veterans, as compared to non-veterans, in the fire service. We hypothesized that firefighters who endorsed military veteran status would have higher rates of mental health symptoms, in comparison to firefighters who did not endorse prior service in the military. Age, gender, and race/ethnicity were used as covariates. The sample was comprised of 910 career firefighters, 209 (23.0%) of whom endorsed military veteran status. One-way analyses of covariance were employed. The military veteran subsample reported significantly higher levels of sleep disturbance, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptom severity in comparison to the non-veteran subsample; however, effect sizes were small indicating that between group differences are actually negligible. Results highlight the need to improve our understanding of risk and resilience factors for firefighters who have served in the military, as this line of inquiry has potentially important mental health intervention implications for this exceptionally understudied population.

83,Pre-treatment factor structures of the Montgomery and Ã…sberg Depression Rating scale as predictors of response to escitalopram in Indian patients with non-psychotic major depressive disorder,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a broad heterogeneous construct resolving into several symptom-clusters by factor analysis. The aim was to find the factor structures of MDD as per Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and whether they predict escitalopram response. Methods: In a longitudinal study at a tertiary institute in north India, 116 adult out-patients with non-psychotic unipolar MDD were assessed with MADRS before and after treatment with escitalopram (10â€“20mg) over 6â€“8 weeks for drug response. Results: For total 116 patients pre-treatment four factor structures of MADRS extracted by principal component analysis with varimax rotation altogether explained a variance of 57%: first factor â€˜detachmentâ€™ (concentration difficulty, lassitude, inability to feel); second factor â€˜psychic anxietyâ€™ (suicidal thoughts and inner tension); third â€˜mood-pessimismâ€™ (apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts) and fourth â€˜vegetativeâ€™ (decreased sleep, appetite). Eighty patients (68.9%) who completed the study had mean age 35.37 Â± 10.9 yrs, majority were male (57.5%), with mean pre-treatment MADRS score 28.77 Â± 5.18 and majority (65%) having moderate severity (MADRS < 30). Among them 56 (70%) responded to escitalopram. At the end of the treatment there were significant changes in all the 4 factor structures (p < 0.01). Vegetative function was an important predictor of response (p < 0.01, odd's ratio: 1.3 [1.1â€“1.6] 95% CI). Melancholia significantly predicted non-response (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Non-psychotic unipolar major depression having moderate severity in north Indian patients as per MADRS resolved into four factor-structures all significantly improved with adequate escitalopram treatment. Understanding the factor structure is important as they can be important predictor of escitalopram response.

84,First-cycle REM density in never-depressed subjects with borderline personality disorder,"Background: There is much interest in the identification of polysomnographic markers of liability to the mood disorders that may predate the onset of illness in high-risk subjects, and/or remain altered after remission. One such putative marker is rapid eye movement (REM) density during the first REM period.; Methods: Never-depressed subjects with borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a group at high risk for the mood disorders were compared by continuous 48-hour ambulatory electroencephalographic monitoring to age- and gender-matched controls.; Results: Subjects with BPD had significantly higher REM density during the first REM period. One man with BPD who later committed suicide had REM density values exceeding the mean value of his group by 2 SD.; Conclusions: These data extend the view that REM density in the first REM period can be a marker of liability to the mood disorders, as it is present in a group of young subjects at heightened risk for depression.;Borderline Personality Disorder/*psychology, Depression/*diagnosis, Sleep, REM/*physiology, Adult, Electroencephalography, Humans, Male, Middle Aged","Battaglia, M; Ferini Strambi, L; Bertella, S; Bajo, S & Bellodi, L",1,84

However, the speed, longevity and consistency of these effects are unknown.; Aims: To test the following: whether the efficacy of online CBT-I was sustained over 18 months; how rapidly the effects of CBT-I emerged; evidence for distinct trajectories of change in depressive symptoms; and predictors of these trajectories.; Method: A randomised controlled trial compared the 6-week Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) CBT-I program to an attention control program. Adults (N=1149) with clinical insomnia and subclinical depression symptoms were recruited online from the Australian community.; Results: Depression, anxiety and insomnia decreased significantly by week 4 of the intervention period and remained significantly lower relative to control for >18 months (between-group Cohen's d=0.63, 0.47, 0.55, respectively, at 18 months). Effects on suicidal ideation were only short term. Two depression trajectories were identified using growth mixture models: improving (95%) and stable/deteriorating (5%) symptoms. More severe baseline depression, younger age and limited comfort with the internet were associated with reduced odds of improvement.; Conclusions: Online CBT-I produced rapid and long-term symptom reduction in people with subclinical depressive symptoms, although the initial effect on suicidal ideation was not sustained.; Declaration Of Interest: P.J.B. has received grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) during the conduct of the study.

86,Evaluation of adjunct extended-release quetiapine fumarate on sleep disturbance and quality in patients with major depressive disorder and an inadequate response to on-going antidepressant therapy,"Sleep disturbance is common in depression and is a risk factor for recurrence and suicide. This analysis evaluated the effects of adjunct extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) on sleep disturbance and quality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and an inadequate response to on-going antidepressant therapy. Pooled data from two 6-wk, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were analysed post hoc. Patients received once-daily quetiapine XR [(150mg/d), n = 309; (300mg/d), n = 307] or placebo (n = 303) adjunct to on-going antidepressant therapy. Analyses included: change from randomization in Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Item 4 (reduced sleep) score; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) Items 4 (insomnia-early), 5 (insomnia-middle) and 6 (insomnia-late) scores; HAMD sleep disturbance factor (Items 4 + 5 + 6); Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score. Change in MADRS total score was also evaluated in patients stratified by HAMD sleep disturbance factor score (high â‰¥ 4 and low < 4) at randomization. At week 6, adjunct quetiapine XR (150 and 300mg/d) reduced MADRS Item 4, HAMD Items 4, 5 and 6, HAMD sleep disturbance factor and PSQI global scores from randomization vs. placebo (all p < 0.001). In patients with high sleep disturbance, quetiapine XR (both doses) improved depressive symptoms (MADRS total score) vs placebo from week 1 onwards (p < 0.01). Adjunct quetiapine XR improved sleep disturbance and quality vs. placebo in patients with MDD and an inadequate response to on-going antidepressant treatment, and was effective against depressive symptoms in patients experiencing high sleep disturbance.

87,Transcranial direct current stimulation as a treatment for depression in the hemodialysis setting,"This chapter presents a case report of a 77-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease secondary to glomerulonephritis who had been treated with hemodialysis for 7 years. He described several months history of depressive symptoms, including sleep disturbance, low energy, low mood, decreased motivation, and ruminating thoughts regarding past events and regrets. He also described negative views of the future and had fleeting suicidal thoughts, although he denied wanting to harm himself. This case report demonstrates that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be successfully administered to a patient with multiple medical comorbidities in a hemodialysis unit. Although there are obvious limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn regarding efficacy, given that there were no major changes in the patient that would explain the improvement in their previously persistent depressive symptoms, it appears that tDCS was beneficial in the treatment of depression in this case. Importantly, administering tDCS in this unique setting was shown to be both feasible and well tolerated.

An estimated 800000 people die by committing suicide annually.; Objectives: To better understand the association between aggressive suicidal attempt and non-aggressive suicidal attempt in patients with suicide attempt in the emergency department.; Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on suicide attempters of eastern region of Turkey between May 2008 and January 2012. Information of all adult suicide attempts was collected prospectively on a form. Suicide attempts were grouped as aggressive and non-aggressive attempts on a specially designed data-collection form. The aggressive suicide attempts contained violent suicide methods such as firearm, hanging, jumping, car exhaust or drowning.; Results: A total of 533 patients were included. Sixty-four of these patients admitted to ED with aggressive suicide attempt (12%). Non-aggressive suicide attempts were consulted to psychiatry more compared to aggressive ones (%73.6, n = 345 vs. %32.8, n = 21, P < 0.0001). Agitation in ED and being male increased aggressive suicide attempt risk by 3.5 (%95 CI: 1.6-7.6) and 3.2 times (%95 CI: 1.8-5.5), agitated patients in ED group and male group respectively. Patients with aggressive suicide attempt were statistically more frequent among these patients; patients with agitation, those hospitalized in intensive care or surgical services and those whose length of stay in the emergency department was less than one day (P < 0.05 for all). Patients with non-aggressive suicide attempt were statistically more frequent in these patients; patients complained of nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fatigue, those with confusion, those tending to sleep, those hospitalized in internal services or emergency ward and finally those whose length of stay in the emergency department was more than one day (P < 0.05 for all).; Conclusions: Patients with aggressive suicide attempt who have high risk of dying should be recognized and requested psychiatric consultation even if not in the emergency department.; Demography, Suicide, Suicide, Attempt, Violence","Bayramoglu, Atif; Saritemur, Murat; Akgol Gur, Sultan Tuna & Emet, Mucahit",0,88

Significantly more boys than girls reported injuries. Injured students were more likely than non-injured students to report anxiety-induced insomnia, being physically attacked, being in a physical fight, and being lonely in the past year, and they were also more likely to report being bullied, using tobacco, drinking alcohol, and missing school in the past month. For both boys and girls, the most common type of injury reported was a broken bone or dislocated joint and the most common injury cause was the student falling. However, most students were not able to provide a specific answer to either question.; Conclusion: The GSHS has been conducted in 100 low- and middle-income countries and territories around the world, and new waves of data collection are currently being planned and implemented. The utility of the injury data from the GSHS would be improved if the injury type and cause response items were updated to better capture information about self-harm, sports injuries, and other statistics that will provide a stronger foundation for evidence-based injury prevention interventions in adolescent populations.; Copyright Ã‚Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

91,Sleep problems and suicidal behaviors in college students,"Using a large sample of college students, objectives were to examine (1) the overlap between poor sleep and suicide risk status, (2) whether poor sleep was associated with suicide behaviors above and beyond depression, (3) whether sleep problems and depression interacted to predict increased suicidal behaviors or risk, and (4) which specific components of sleep were uniquely associated with suicidal behaviors. Participants were 1700 college students (ages 18-29 years; 65% female) from two universities who completed measures assessing sleep, depressive symptoms, and suicidal behaviors (Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaireâ€“Revised [SBQ-R], a composite measure including ideation, past attempt, disclosure to others, and future likelihood of suicide that includes a cutoff for determining participants with suicide risk). Approximately one-quarter (24%) of participants were classified with suicide risk. Four-fifths (82.7%) of participants classified with suicide risk also met cutoff criteria for sleep problems; conversely, almost one-third (31.3%) of the participants classified with sleep problems were also classified with suicide risk. Total sleep problems remained significantly associated with suicidal behaviors above and beyond depressive symptoms, though sleep and depression did not interact to predict suicidal behaviors or risk. When considered together and controlling for sex, the odds of being classified with suicide risk were 6.54 times greater for participants with elevated depressive symptoms and 2.70 times greater for participants with sleep problems. Analyses examining specific sleep domains found shorter sleep duration, having bad dreams, feeling too cold while sleeping, and sleep medication use to each be independently associated with suicidal behaviors. Findings add to a growing body of literature linking sleep and suicide in college students.

92,"Computer-guided problem-solving treatment for depression, PTSD, and insomnia symptoms in student veterans: A pilot randomized controlled trial","Depression is a highly prevalent psychological disorder experienced disproportionately by college student military veterans with many deleterious effects including risk for suicide. Treatment can help, but the debilitating nature of depression often makes seeking in-person treatment difficult and many are deterred by stigma, inconvenience, concerns about privacy, or a preference to manage problems themselves. The current study examines the efficacy of a computer-guided Problem-Solving Treatment (ePSTÂ®) for reducing symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and insomnia in student military veterans. Twenty-four student veterans (Meanage = 32.7) with symptoms of depression were randomly assigned either to a treatment group receiving six weekly sessions of ePST or to a minimal contact control group (MCC). Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression scale at baseline and then weekly through post-ePST or post-MCC. PTSD and insomnia questionnaires were also completed at baseline and posttreatment. A linear mixed model regression showed a statistically significant Group (ePST vs. MCC) Ã— Time (pretreatment through posttreatment) interaction for depression, with the ePST showing substantial improvements in depressive symptoms over the 6-week period. Significant improvements were also seen in PTSD and insomnia symptoms. Results suggest that ePST can effectively treat depression, PTSD, and insomnia symptoms in student military veterans and may be a viable alternative for those who are not able to access live therapy. Future work should examine the durability of treatment effects and utility for more severe depression and suicide prevention.

93,Supportive Mental Health Self-Monitoring among Smartphone Users with Psychological Distress: Protocol for a Fully Mobile Randomized Controlled Trial,"Mobile health (mHealth) could be widely used in the population to improve access to psychological treatment. In this paper, we describe the development of a mHealth intervention on the basis of supportive self-monitoring and describe the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness among smartphone users with psychological distress. Based on power analysis, a representative quota sample of Nâ€‰=â€‰186 smartphone users will be recruited, with an over-sampling of persons with moderate to high distress. Over a 4-week period, the intervention will be compared to a self-monitoring without intervention group and a passive control group. Telephone interviews will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4â€‰weeks), and 12-week follow-up to assess study outcomes. The primary outcome will be improvement of mental health. Secondary outcomes will include well-being, intentions toward help-seeking and help-seeking behavior, user activation, attitudes toward mental-health services, perceived stigmatization, smartphone app quality, user satisfaction, engagement, and adherence with the intervention. Additionally, data from the user's daily life as collected during self-monitoring will be used to investigate risk and protective factors of mental health in real-world settings. Therefore, this study will allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone application as a widely accessible and low-cost intervention to improve mental health on a population level. It also allows to identify new assessment approaches in the field of psychiatric epidemiology.; ambulatory assessment, mental health, mobile intervention, psychological distress, randomized controlled trial, self-monitoring, smartphone","Beiwinkel, Till; Hey, Stefan; Bock, Olaf & RÃ¶ssler, Wulf",0,93
94,Examining the relationship between multiple primary cancers and psychological distress: A review of current literature,"Objective: The incidence of multiple primary cancers (MPCs) is increasing, but little is known about psychological distress in this population. The purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the literature regarding what is known about psychological distress in adults who have experienced MPC diagnoses. Methods: All potentially eligible studies identified in PubMed and CIHL were reviewed by 2 independent evaluators, and each relevant article was assessed for methodological quality. Data were extracted, organized, and recorded using a coding log, PRISMA flow diagram, and a standardized table of evidence. Effect size (ES) values were calculated using Cohen's d. Results: Five of the 562 potentially relevant articles were selected for final analysis. MPC survivors, when compared with single cancer survivors, had lower global quality of life (d = 0.32â€“0.37), poorer emotional role function and stress (d = 0.08â€“0.20), greater and more frequent distress (d = 0.11â€“0.37), and greater subclinical anxiety (d = 0.15). Depressive symptoms were variable (d = 0.01â€“0.22), and no differences between MPC and single cancer groups were identified for sleep and suicidal ideation. Conclusion: There is a substantial lack of evidence focused on psychological distress among the growing MPC survivor population. ES noted in the 5 studies reflect small but potentially significant increases in psychological distress in survivors of MPC compared with survivors of a single cancer. Clinicians should be aware of this atâ€risk population when screening for distress in cancer survivors. Suggestions for future research are provided.

95,Do treatments for panic disorder improve sleep in patients with unexplained chest pain?,"A significant number of patients with unexplained chest pain (UCP) have panic disorder (PD), and most individuals with PD report poor sleep, including insomnia and nocturnal panic attacks (NPA). The objective of the study was to examine the impact of treatment for PD on sleep problems and to assess the influence of pretreatment insomnia on posttreatment persistence of PD diagnosis and pain severity. Secondary analyses were conducted on sleep data collected from 42 PD patients consulting emergency departments (ED) for UCP. In this quasi-experimental design, cohorts of participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) 7 sessions of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for PD, (b) a 1-session panic management intervention, (c) pharmacotherapy, or (d) usual care. Data from clinical interviews performed by trained assistants and from self-report questionnaires were collected before and after treatment.

96,Spontaneous adverse event reports associated with zolpidem in Australia 2001“2008,"A prominent media publicity cluster during 2007â€“2008 in Australia linked the common hypnotic zolpidem to adverse drug reaction reports of parasomnias, amnesia, hallucinations and suicidality. The collection of adverse drug reaction data through spontaneous reporting systems is a mainstay of drug safety monitoring, but a stimulated reporting event such as this often renders such data uninterpretable. As such, we aimed to investigate whether these associations were present before the media cluster and then to quantify the effect of stimulated reporting on those four specific outcomes. Using disproportionality analyses we compared zolpidem to all other drugs in the database, and then separately to each of all hypnotics, then all benzodiazepines, and then temazepam alone, and did so in every year from 2001 to 2008. Year-by-year analyses of Reporting odds ratios for zolpidem exposure and adverse events of interest, adjusted for a number of covariates, revealed an association between zolpidem exposure and parasomnias, amnesia and hallucination both before and after the cluster of media publicity beginning in early 2007. The odds ratios increased significantly after the media publicity for only parasomnias and amnesia. Suicidality was increased in some analyses, but limited data make this outcome difficult to interpret. We conclude that zolpidem adverse drug reaction reports have higher odds for parasomnia, amnesia, hallucination and perhaps suicidality compared to either all other drugs or hypnotics, even before the media publicity cluster. However, the extant literature and the limitations of these spontaneously reported adverse drug reaction data do not allow us to conclude that these events are related causally to zolpidem.

97,Sleep and circadian rhythms as possible trait markers of suicide attempt in bipolar disorders: An actigraphy study,"Background: The poor prognostic of Bipolar disorders (BD) is closely linked to deaths by suicide. Sleep and circadian abnormalities are observed during all phases of BD and are also associated with suicide attempt (SA). In this context, this study sought to identify specific sleep and circadian rhythms markers associated with suicidal attempt in euthymic patients with BD.; Methods: The sample (Nâ€¯=â€¯236) comprised 3 groups: 147 patients with BD including 57 with a history of SA and 90 without (NoSA), and 89 healthy controls (HC). All participants were recorded during 21 days with actigraphy.; Results: SA was associated with women gender (pâ€¯=â€¯0.03), familial history of SA (pâ€¯=â€¯0.03), mixed episodes (p = 0.001), and benzodiazepines (p = 0.019). SA, compared to noSA, had a morning phase preference (pâ€¯=â€¯0.04), and were more vigorous on the circadian type inventory (pâ€¯=â€¯0.04), and tended to suffer more from insomnia (45% versus 25% respectively, pâ€¯=â€¯0.10). SA was also associated with an earlier onset of daily activity assessed with actigraphy (M10 onset: pâ€¯=â€¯0.01). Backward stepwise linear regression indicated that a combination of four variables (Gender, vigour, insomnia, M10onset) significantly differentiated patients with SA from NoSA (pâ€¯=â€¯0.03).; Limitations: Cross-sectional design, and no examination of suicidal behaviors' subgroups such as first attempters or repeaters, or violent suicide attempt.; Conclusions: Woman gender, vigorous circadian type, insomnia and an earlier daily activity appeared independently associated with SA in BD. If these biomarkers are confirmed in prospective studies, they should be screened and used to prevent suicide, with the development of personal and targeted chronobiological treatments.; Copyright Â© 2018.

98,"A Homer 1 gene variant influences brain structure and function, lithium effects on white matter, and antidepressant response in bipolar disorder: A multimodal genetic imaging study","Background: The Homer family of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins plays a crucial role in glutamate-mediated synaptic plasticity, a phenotype associated with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Homer is a target for antidepressants and mood stabilizers. The AA risk genotype of the Homer rs7713917 A > G SNP has been associated with mood disorders and suicide, and in healthy humans with brain function. Despite the evidence linking Homer 1 gene and function to mood disorder, as well as its involvement in animal models of depression, no study has yet investigated the role of Homer in bipolar depression and treatment response. Methods: We studied 199 inpatients, affected by a major depressive episode in course of BD. 147 patients were studied with structural MRI of grey and white matter, and 50 with BOLD functional MRI of emotional processing. 158 patients were treated with combined total sleep deprivation and light therapy. Results: At neuroimaging, patients with the AA genotype showed lower grey matter volumes in medial prefrontal cortex, higher BOLD fMRI neural responses to emotional stimuli in anterior cingulate cortex, and lower fractional anisotropy in bilateral frontal WM tracts. Lithium treatment increased axial diffusivity more in AA patients than in Gcarriers. At clinical evaluation, the same AA homozygotes showed a worse antidepressant response to combined SD and LT. Conclusions: rs7713917 influenced brain grey and white matter structure and function in BD, long term effects of lithium on white matter structure, and antidepressant response to chronotherapeutics, thus suggesting that glutamatergic neuroplasticity and Homer 1 function might play a role in BD psychopathology and response to treatment.

101,Risk of suicide in high risk pregnancy: an exploratory study,"Objective: To identify the risk of suicidal behavior in high-risk pregnant women at a public hospital in SÃ£o Paulo.; Methods: We conducted a semi-structured interview with each of the participants (n = 268) through a previously prepared questionnaire. Risk of suicidal behavior was assessed by the Portuguese version of PRIME-MD.; Results: The mean age of patients was 29 years (SD = 0.507) and gestation period was 30 weeks (SD = 0.556). Of the total sample, specific risk of suicide was found in 5% (n = 14). Of these, 85% have a stable relationship (married or cohabitating), the pregnancy was planned in 50% of cases, and 71% have no religion or professional activities. The correlation of risk of suicide with data from marital status, planned birth, age, education, professional practice, risk of prematurity, and religion showed that having a religion is statistically significant (p = 0.012). There were no positive associations for any of the other selected variables when compared with the risk of suicide. By correlating the risk of suicide with other characteristic symptoms of major depression, there was statistical significance in the sample with regard to insomnia or hypersomnia (p = 0.003), fatigue or loss of energy (p = 0.001), decreased or increased appetite (p = 0.005), less interest in daily activities (p = 0.000), depressed mood (p = 0.000), feelings of worthlessness or guilt (p = 0.000), decreased concentration (p = 0.002), and agitation or psychomotor retardation (p = 0.002).; Conclusion: We found that religion can be a protective factor against suicidal behavior. Besides providing a social support network needed by women during pregnancy, religion supports belief in life after death and in a loving God, giving purpose to life and self esteem and providing models for coping with crises. The results show the importance of prevention and early diagnosis of suicidal behavior, since suicide is an attempt to move from one sphere to another by force, seeking to solve what seems impossible.;Pregnancy, High-Risk/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*prevention & control, Adolescent, Adult, Child, Educational Status, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Religion, Risk Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Suicide, Attempted/psychology, Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data, Young Adult","Benute, GlÃ¡ucia Rosana Guerra; Nomura, Roseli Mieko Yamamoto; Jorge, Vanessa Marques Ferreira; Nonnenmacher, Daniele; FrÃ¡guas Junior, RenÃ©rio; Lucia, Mara Cristina Souza de & Zugaib, Marcelo",1,101

As physicians, one holds a unique place in society. One is entrusted with the responsibility of healing people and advancing the health of populations. This role is an honor and a privilege, and yet it is one that comes with the cost of jeopardizing our wellbeing. Physicians may be considered an 'at risk' population, with higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicide, divorce, stress, and emotional exhaustion than other segments of the overall population. The role played by physicians requires many sacrificesâ€”long hours, isolation from friends and family, psychological stress and responsibility in caring for very sick patients, tolerance of uncertainty, sleep deprivation, and huge economic burdens following many years of costly education, among others.

103,Out of the darkness and into the light: women's experiences with depression after childbirth,"While becoming a mother can be a fulfilling and joyful experience, 10-28% of women are affected by an intense emotional response commonly called postpartum depression. This phenomenon is distinguishable from the transitory baby blues"" and is often characterized by crying confusion fatigue depression insomnia difficulty caring for the baby and self and suicidal thoughts. Research on postpartum depression has largely concentrated on investigating its possible causes and predictors utilizing quantitative methodology. Women are the experts of their own lives yet their voices are missing in the existing body of knowledge about depression after childbirth. In this exploratory qualitative study I used a feminist perspective to explore the experiences of eight women who had recovered from postpartum depression. A three-stage model emerged that demonstrated how women made sense of that time in their lives. The findings of this study provide a contextual picture of women's experiences with depression after childbirth.

105,Risk Factors Proximate to Suicide and Suicide Risk Assessment in the Context of Denied Suicide Ideation,"Health care providers have significant opportunities to identify individuals at near-term risk for suicide, but lack empirical data on near-term risk factors. This study aimed to identify dynamic, state-related risk factors observed by clinical practitioners within the last 30Â days of life of 157 patients who died by suicide and to compare these near-term risk factors among patients who denied versus responded positively to having suicide ideation (SI) when last asked by a clinical practitioner prior to their death. Risk factors charted for the majority of all decedents were a history of prior suicide ideation and/or suicide attempt, current anxiety/agitation and sleep problems, current interpersonal problems or job/financial strain, current comorbid diagnoses, current social isolation/withdrawal, and a family history of mental disorder. Two-thirds of patients denied having SI when last asked and one-half of these patients were dead by suicide within 2Â days. Decedents who denied having SI were quite similar in charted diagnoses, symptoms, behaviors, and environmental circumstances to decedents who responded affirmatively to having SI. Reliance on verbalized or reported SI as a gateway to a suicide risk assessment is questioned and the need for better understanding near-term risk for suicide, particularly in the absence of stated SI, is highlighted.; Â© 2017 The American Association of Suicidology.Anxiety*/diagnosis, Anxiety*/psychology, Interpersonal Relations*, Risk Assessment*/methods, Risk Assessment*/standards, Suicidal Ideation*, Suicide*/prevention & control, Suicide*/psychology, Suicide*/statistics & numerical data, Health Personnel/*standards, Adult, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Male, Medical History Taking, Middle Aged, Needs Assessment, Risk Factors, Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data, United States","Berman, Alan L.",1,105
106,Sleep disturbances and suicide risk: A review of the literature,"A growing body of research indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with suicidal ideation and behaviors. This article (1) provides a critical review of the extant literature on sleep and suicidally and (2) addresses shared underlying neurobiological factors, biological and social zeitgebers, treatment implications, and future directions for research. Findings indicate that suicidal ideation and behaviors are closely associated with sleep complaints, and in some cases, this association exists above and beyond depression. Several cross-sectional investigations indicate a unique association between nightmares and suicidal ideation, whereas the relationship between insomnia and suicidality requires further study. Underlying neurobiological factors may, in part, account for the relationship between sleep and suicide. Serotonergic neurotransmission appears to play a critical role in both sleep and suicide. Finally, it remains unclear whether or not sleep-oriented interventions may reduce risk for suicidal behaviors. Unlike other suicide risk factors, sleep complaints may be particularly amenable to treatment. As a warning sign, disturbances in sleep may thus be especially useful to research and may serve as an important clinical target for future suicide intervention efforts.

108,Objectively Assessed Sleep Variability as an Acute Warning Sign of Suicidal Ideation in a Longitudinal Evaluation of Young Adults at High Suicide Risk,"Objective: Young adults attempt suicide at disproportionately high rates relative to other groups and demonstrate high rates of sleep disturbance. No study has yet prospectively evaluated disturbed sleep as an acute indicator of risk using an objective index of sleep. We investigated objective and subjective parameters of disturbed sleep as a warning sign of suicidal ideation among young adults over an acute period.; Methods: A longitudinal study across a 21-day observation period and 3 time points. Fifty of 4,847 participants (aged 18-23 years) were prescreened from a university undergraduate research pool (February 2007-June 2008) on the basis of suicide attempt history and recent suicidal ideation. Actigraphic and subjective sleep parameters were evaluated as acute predictors of suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation), with adjustment for baseline symptoms. Hierarchical regression analyses were employed to predict residual change scores.; Results: Ninety-six percent of participants (n = 48) endorsed a suicide attempt history. Mean actigraphy values revealed objectively disturbed sleep parameters; 78% (n = 39) and 36% (n = 18) endorsed clinically significant insomnia and nightmares, respectively. When results were controlled for baseline suicidal and depressive symptoms, actigraphic and subjective sleep parameters predicted suicidal ideation residual change scores at 7- and 21-day follow-ups (P < .001). Specifically, actigraphy-defined variability in sleep timing, insomnia, and nightmares predicted increases in suicidal ideation (P < .05). In a test of competing risk factors, sleep variability outperformed depressive symptoms in the longitudinal prediction of suicidal ideation across time points (P < .05).; Conclusions: Objectively and subjectively measured sleep disturbances predicted acute suicidal ideation increases in this population, independent of depressed mood.

109,Sleep architecture parameters as a putative biomarker of suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression,"Background: Disturbed sleep may confer risk for suicidal behaviors. Polysomnographic (PSG) sleep parameters have not been systematically evaluated in association with suicidal ideation (SI) among individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This secondary data analysis included 54 TRD individuals (N = 30 with major depressive disorder (MDD) and N = 24 with bipolar depression (BD)). PSG sleep parameters included Sleep Efficiency (SE), Total Sleep Time (TST), Wakefulness After Sleep Onset (WASO), REM percent/latency, and non-REM (NREM) Sleep Stages 1â€“4. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to group participants according to presence or absence of SI. Sleep abnormalities were hypothesized among those with current SI. ANOVA analyses were conducted before (Model 1) and after adjusting for depression (Model 2) and diagnostic variables (Model 3). Results: Significant differences in PSG parameters were observed in Model 1; those with SI had less NREM Stage 4 sleep (p < .05). After adjusting for central covariates, Models 2 and 3 revealed significantly less NREM Stage 4 sleep, lower SE (P < .05), and higher WASO (P < .05) among those with SI. BD participants with SI also had less NREM Stage 4 and more NREM Stage 1 sleep. Limitations: 1) a predominantly white sample; 2) exclusion of imminent suicide risk; 3) concomitant mood stabilizer use among BD patients; and 4) single-item SI assessment. Conclusions: Independent of depression severity, SI was associated with less NREM Stage 4 sleep, and higher nocturnal wakefulness across diagnostic groups. Sleep may warrant further investigation in the pathogenesis of suicide risk, particularly in TRD, where risk may be heightened.

110,"Association of poor subjective sleep quality with risk for death by suicide during a 10-year period: A longitudinal, population-based study of late life","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 72(1) of JAMA Psychiatry (see record [rid]2015-03879-016[/rid]). The y-axis of Figure 1 on page 1133 was incorrectly labeled. This article was corrected online.] Importance: Older adults have high rates of sleep disturbance, die by suicide at disproportionately higher rates compared with other age groups, and tend to visit their physician in the weeks preceding suicide death. To our knowledge, to date, no study has examined disturbed sleep as an independent risk factor for late-life suicide. Objective: To examine the relative independent risk for suicide associated with poor subjective sleep quality in a population-based study of older adults during a 10-year observation period. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal case-control cohort study of late-life suicide among a multisite, population-based community sample of older adults participating in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Of 14 456 community older adults sampled, 400 control subjects were matched (on age, sex, and study site) to 20 suicide decedents. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary measures included the Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, and vital statistics. Results: Hierarchical logistic regressions revealed that poor sleep quality at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk for suicide (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95%CI, 1.14-1.69; P < .001) by 10 follow-up years. In addition, 2 sleep items were individually associated with elevated risk for suicide at 10-year follow-up: difficulty falling asleep (OR, 2.24; 95%CI, 1.27-3.93; P < .01) and nonrestorative sleep (OR, 2.17; 95%CI, 1.28-3.67; P < .01). Controlling for depressive symptoms, baseline self-reported sleep quality was associated with increased risk for death by suicide (OR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.04-1.63; P < .05). Conclusions and Relevance: Our results indicate that poor subjective sleep quality is associated with increased risk for death by suicide 10 years later, even after adjustment for depressive symptoms. Disturbed sleep appears to confer considerable risk, independent of depressed mood, for the most severe suicidal behaviors and may warrant inclusion in suicide risk assessment frameworks to enhance detection of risk and intervention opportunity in late life.

111,Sleep disturbances as an evidence-based suicide risk factor,"Increasing research indicates that sleep disturbances may confer increased risk for suicidal behaviors, including suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide. Despite increased investigation, a number of methodological problems present important limitations to the validity and generalizability of findings in this area, which warrant additional focus. To evaluate and delineate sleep disturbances as an evidence-based suicide risk factor, a systematic review of the extant literature was conducted with methodological considerations as a central focus. The following methodologic criteria were required for inclusion: the report (1) evaluated an index of sleep disturbance; (2) examined an outcome measure for suicidal behavior; (3) adjusted for presence of a depression diagnosis or depression severity, as a covariate; and (4) represented an original investigation as opposed to a chart review. Reports meeting inclusion criteria were further classified and reviewed according to: study design and timeframe; sample type and size; sleep disturbance, suicide risk, and depression covariate assessment measure(s); and presence of positive versus negative findings. Based on keyword search, the following search engines were used: PubMed and PsycINFO. Search criteria generated Nâ€‰=â€‰82 articles representing original investigations focused on sleep disturbances and suicide outcomes. Of these, Nâ€‰=â€‰18 met inclusion criteria for review based on systematic analysis. Of the reports identified, Nâ€‰=â€‰18 evaluated insomnia or poor sleep quality symptoms, whereas Nâ€‰=â€‰8 assessed nightmares in association with suicide risk. Despite considerable differences in study designs, samples, and assessment techniques, the comparison of such reports indicates preliminary, converging evidence for sleep disturbances as an empirical risk factor for suicidal behaviors, while highlighting important, future directions for increased investigation.;Sleep Wake Disorders/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Depression/psychology, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Dreams/psychology, Evidence-Based Medicine, Humans, Risk Factors, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/complications, Suicidal Ideation, Suicide/statistics & numerical data, Suicide, Attempted/psychology","Bernert, Rebecca A; Kim, Joanne S; Iwata, Naomi G & Perlis, Michael L",0,111
112,Behavioural phenotype of Cornelia de Lange syndrome,"A postal questionnaire was used to study 49 individuals with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (including both the classical and the mild forms) to ascertain behavioural phenotype. Ages ranged from early childhood to adulthood (mean age, 10.2 years; SD, 7.8) and the degree of mental retardation from borderline (10%), through mild (8%), moderate (18%), and severe (20%) to profound (43%). A wide variety of symptoms occurred frequently, notably hyperactivity (40%), self injury (44%), daily aggression (49%), and sleep disturbance (55%). These correlated closely with the presence of an autistic like syndrome and with the degree of mental retardation. The frequency and severity of disturbance, continuing beyond childhood, is important when planning the amount and duration of support required by parents.;De Lange Syndrome/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*etiology, Adolescent, Adult, Aggression/psychology, Autistic Disorder/etiology, Child, De Lange Syndrome/genetics, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intellectual Disability/etiology, Male, Mood Disorders/etiology, Phenotype, Seizures/etiology, Self-Injurious Behavior/etiology, Social Behavior Disorders/etiology, Surveys and Questionnaires","Berney, T P; Ireland, M & Burn, J",0,112
113,Symptom features of postpartum depression: are they distinct?,"The clinical features of postpartum depression and depression occurring outside of the postpartum period have rarely been compared. The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR(16)) provides a means to assess core depressive symptoms. Item response theory and classical test theory analyses were conducted to examine differences between postpartum (n=95) and nonpostpartum (n=50) women using the QIDS-SR(16). The two groups of females were matched on the basis of age. All met DSM-IV criteria for nonpsychotic major depressive disorder. Low energy level and restlessness/agitation were major characteristics of depression in both groups. The nonpostpartum group reported more sad mood, more suicidal ideation, and more reduced interest. In contrast, for postpartum depression sad mood was less prominent, while psychomotor symptoms (restlessness/agitation) and impaired concentration/decision-making were most prominent. These symptomatic differences between postpartum and other depressives suggest the need to include agitation/restlessness and impaired concentration/decision-making among screening questions for postpartum depression.;Models, Psychological*, Depression, Postpartum/*diagnosis, Personality Inventory/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Attention, Cognition Disorders/diagnosis, Cognition Disorders/psychology, Decision Making, Depression, Postpartum/psychology, Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Diagnosis, Differential, Factor Analysis, Statistical, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data, Psychometrics, Psychomotor Agitation/diagnosis, Psychomotor Agitation/psychology, Reproducibility of Results, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Suicide/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires","Bernstein, Ira H; Rush, A John; Yonkers, Kimberly; Carmody, Thomas J; Woo, Ada; McConnell, Kimberly & Trivedi, Madhukar H",1,113

There was no difference in global Hamilton Scores between the index and the major depression sample. The latter however more often exhibited family and personal history of psychiatric illness early awakening guilt suicidal ideas shorter index episodes of depression and better response to treatment. The three samples were followed up for a period of up to 5 years. The index sample did worse on follow-up than did the depressed and the neurological samples.

115,Severe Childhood Autism: The Family Lived Experience,"This research examined the experiences of families living with a child with severe autism. There is limited literature on the experiences of families when a child has severe autism as distinct from milder autism and includes the voices of multiple family members. Van Manen's phenomenological approach was used for data collection and analysis. This approach allowed for the use of innovative data sources, including unstructured individual and family interviews, observations, and family lifelines (a pictorial, temporal picture with comments of the families lives). This study included 29 interviews with 22 participants from 11 families. All data were creatively triangulated and interpreted. Six essential themes were identified. First, families experienced autism as mysterious and complex because it is an invisible and unpredictable condition with diagnostic challenges. Second, families described severe autism behaviors that often caused self-injury, harm to others and damaged homes. Third, profound communication deficits resulted in isolation between the family and child. Fourth, families discussed the unrelenting stress from lack of sleep, managing the child's developmental delays, coordinating and financing services, and concern for the child's future. Fifth, families described consequences of isolation from friends, school, the public, and health providers. Sixth, families portrayed their need for compassionate support and formed 'hybrid families' (nuclear, extended families and friends) to gain support. Study results can be utilized to educate nurses/other providers about the unique needs of families with children with severe autism and could influence health care policies to improve the care for families caring for children with severe autism.; Copyright Ã‚Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

116,"Serotonin synthesis, release and reuptake in terminals: a mathematical model","Background: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that has been linked to a wide variety of behaviors including feeding and body-weight regulation, social hierarchies, aggression and suicidality, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcoholism, anxiety, and affective disorders. Full understanding of serotonergic systems in the central nervous system involves genomics, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, and behavior. Though associations have been found between functions at these different levels, in most cases the causal mechanisms are unknown. The scientific issues are daunting but important for human health because of the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other pharmacological agents to treat disorders in the serotonergic signaling system.; Methods: We construct a mathematical model of serotonin synthesis, release, and reuptake in a single serotonergic neuron terminal. The model includes the effects of autoreceptors, the transport of tryptophan into the terminal, and the metabolism of serotonin, as well as the dependence of release on the firing rate. The model is based on real physiology determined experimentally and is compared to experimental data.; Results: We compare the variations in serotonin and dopamine synthesis due to meals and find that dopamine synthesis is insensitive to the availability of tyrosine but serotonin synthesis is sensitive to the availability of tryptophan. We conduct in silico experiments on the clearance of extracellular serotonin, normally and in the presence of fluoxetine, and compare to experimental data. We study the effects of various polymorphisms in the genes for the serotonin transporter and for tryptophan hydroxylase on synthesis, release, and reuptake. We find that, because of the homeostatic feedback mechanisms of the autoreceptors, the polymorphisms have smaller effects than one expects. We compute the expected steady concentrations of serotonin transporter knockout mice and compare to experimental data. Finally, we study how the properties of the the serotonin transporter and the autoreceptors give rise to the time courses of extracellular serotonin in various projection regions after a dose of fluoxetine.; Conclusions: Serotonergic systems must respond robustly to important biological signals, while at the same time maintaining homeostasis in the face of normal biological fluctuations in inputs, expression levels, and firing rates. This is accomplished through the cooperative effect of many different homeostatic mechanisms including special properties of the serotonin transporters and the serotonin autoreceptors. Many difficult questions remain in order to fully understand how serotonin biochemistry affects serotonin electrophysiology and vice versa, and how both are changed in the presence of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Mathematical models are useful tools for investigating some of these questions.;Models, Biological*, Presynaptic Terminals/*metabolism, Serotonin/*biosynthesis, Serotonin/*secretion, Animals, Autoreceptors/metabolism, Brain/drug effects, Brain/metabolism, Fluoxetine/pharmacology, Food, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Homeostasis/drug effects, Humans, Kinetics, Mice, Presynaptic Terminals/drug effects, Protein Binding/drug effects, Rats, Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/pharmacology, Time Factors","Best, Janet; Nijhout, H Frederik & Reed, Michael",0,116
117,The role of sleep disturbance in the relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation,"We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465 participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal ideation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

118,Depression in women: diagnostic and treatment considerations,"Women experience depression twice as often as men. The diagnostic criteria for depression are the same for both sexes, but women with depression more frequently experience guilt, anxiety, increased appetite and sleep, weight gain and comorbid eating disorders. Women may achieve higher plasma concentrations of antidepressants and thus may require lower dosages of these medications. Depending on the patient's age, the potential effects of antidepressants on a fetus or neonate may need to be considered. Research indicates no increased teratogenic risk from in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants. SSRIs are effective in treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder and many comorbid conditions associated with depression in women. Psychotherapy may be used alone in women with mild to moderate depression, or it may be used adjunctively with antidepressant drug therapy. Women who have severe depression accompanied by active suicidal thoughts or plans should usually be managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist.;Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Depression, Postpartum/diagnosis, Depression, Postpartum/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Patient Education as Topic, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications/diagnosis, Pregnancy Complications/drug therapy, Premenstrual Syndrome/diagnosis, Premenstrual Syndrome/drug therapy, Sex Factors, Teaching Materials","Bhatia, S C & Bhatia, S K",0,118
119,Screening for adolescent suicidality in primary care: the bullying-insomnia-tobacco-stress test A population-based pilot study,"Aim: Adolescents at risk for suicide often see their general practitioner solely for somatic or administrative reasons. A simple screening test given during a conversation would be of substantial help to send a signal and tackle the problem. We propose to update a screening test previously validated in France - the TSTS-Cafard - because of significant changes in the lives of adolescents with the growth of the cyber world since 2000.; Methods: The design and setting was a cross-sectional study involving 912 15-year-old adolescents in 90 French schools. They completed a questionnaire that included the TSTS-Cafard and risk factors extracted from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey. To improve the test, we selected questions drawn from the recent literature. Answers were analysed according to 'suicidality'â€‰=â€‰at least one suicide attempt in life or suicidal ideation often over the past 12â€‰months.; Results: Suicidality rates were 9.6% for boys and 23.1% for girls. Although the TSTS-Cafard test was generally effective, one question was no longer discriminating. A new test, entitled 'BITS', included only four questions on bullying, insomnia, tobacco and stress, with three levels of response and scores ranging from 0 to 8. Improvement was achieved without loss of performance. Using a cut-off score of 3, we achieved 78% accuracy (area under the curve), 75% sensitivity and 70% specificity.; Conclusion: The BITS test could allow the question of suicide risk to be addressed during a routine check-up in primary care but the results need to be validated with 13 to 18-year olds.; Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.adolescent*, general practice*, mass screening*, primary health care*, suicide attempt*","Binder, Philippe; Heintz, Anne-Laure; Servant, Coralie; Roux, Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se; Robin, StÃ©phane; Gicquel, Ludovic & Ingrand, Pierre",0,119
120,Awareness under general anesthesia,"Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind. Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death. For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality. Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed. Results: In the absence of risk factors, awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event. In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher. These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness. They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants). Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise. EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness. If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.

121,The Association Between Sleep Apnea and Suicidal Thought and Behavior: An Analysis of National Survey Data,"Objective: Sleep disturbances have been associated with increased risk for suicidal thought and behavior. The literature in regard to sleep and suicide, however, has focused predominantly on generalized sleep disturbance or insomnia. The purpose of the current study is to examine relationships among sleep apnea and suicidal thought and behavior using a nationally representative sample.; Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2014 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Respondents from a random sample of US households who were 18 years or older (N = 40,149) completed an interview including items assessing past-year sleep apnea, suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempt.; Results: Among respondents with sleep apnea (2.9%; n = 1,155), prevalence of suicidality was reported to be 9.7% for suicidal ideation, 3.4% for suicide planning, and 1.0% for suicide attempt compared with 4.9%, 1.4%, and 0.7%, respectively, for those without sleep apnea. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that sleep apnea was significantly associated with both suicidal ideation (OR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18-1.91) and suicide planning (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.08-2.26) after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, past-year substance use disorder, self-rated overall health, past-year sedative-hypnotic misuse, past-year depressive episode, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, and body mass index. Sleep apnea was not significantly associated with report of past-year suicide attempt (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.66-2.26).; Conclusions: Suicidal ideation and suicide planning were more likely to be endorsed by respondents with sleep apnea compared to those without after accounting for key covariates. Diagnosis of sleep apnea may represent an early opportunity for providers to discuss suicide and mental health with their patients.; Â© Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","Bishop, Todd M.; Ashrafioun, Lisham & Pigeon, Wilfred R.",1,121
122,Sleep and Suicide in Older Adults: An Opportunity for Intervention,"Whether as a standalone disorder or as a symptom associated with existing pathology, the prevalence of sleep disturbance increases with age. Older adults also experience a myriad of risk factors for suicide, including depression, and have elevated rates of suicide. There is now significant evidence linking sleep disturbances to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The use of pharmacologic means to treat insomnia (e.g., sedative hypnotics) is also commonplace among older cohorts and has been associated with suicide. Behavioral treatment of insomnia represents an efficacious alternative to pharmacotherapy among older adults, which while improving sleep, may concurrently reduce depressive symptomatology.

Participants were followed up from 1984-6 until December 31, 2004.; Setting: Residents of Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag County, Norway, aged 20 years or older in 1984-6.; Participants: Altogether 87,285 people were eligible for the survey and 74,977 (86%) took part in one or more aspects of the study.; Interventions: N/A.; Measurements and Results: Three percent of participants experienced sleeping problems every night, 5% experienced problems often"" and 31% reported problems ""sometimes."" There were 188 suicides during follow-up. Sleeping problems at baseline were strongly associated with subsequent suicide risk. Compared to participants who reported no sleeping problems the age- and sex- adjusted hazard ratios for suicide were 1.9 (CI 1.3-2.6) 2.7 (CI 1.4-5.0) and 4.3 (CI 2.3-8.3) for reporting sleeping problems sometimes often or almost every night respectively. Associations were stronger in younger (< 50 years) participants but we found no statistical evidence for gender differences. Adjusting for measures of common mental disorder and alcohol use at baseline weakened the associations but the 3% of subjects with the worst sleep patterns remained at two fold increased risk of suicide.; Conclusions: Sleeping problems are a marker of suicide risk mainly due to the presence of both sleeping problems and mixed anxiety and depression.

124,Trichloroacetic Acid Ingestion: Self-Harm Attempt,"Objective: Trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), or trichloroethanoic acid, is a chemical analogue of acetic acid where three methyl group hydrogen atoms are replaced by chlorine. TCAAs are also abbreviated and referred to as TCAs, causing confusion with the psychiatric antidepressant drug class, especially among patients. TCAAs exist in dermatological treatments such as chemical peels or wart chemoablation medication. TCAA ingestion or overdose can cause gastric irritation symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, or lassitude. This symptomatology is less severe than TCA overdose, where symptoms may include elevated body temperature, blurred vision, dilated pupils, sleepiness, confusion, seizures, rapid heart rate, and cardiac arrest. Owing to the vast difference in symptoms, the need for clinical intervention differs greatly. While overdose of either in a self-harm attempt can warrant psychiatric hospital admission, the risk of death in TCAA ingestion is far less.; Case Report: A patient ingested TCAA in the form of a commercially available dermatological chemical peel as a self-harm attempt, thinking that it was a more injurious TCA.; Conclusion: Awareness among physicians, particularly psychiatrists, regarding this relatively obscure chemical compound (TCAA) and its use by suicidal patients mistakenly believing it to be a substance that can be significantly more lethal (TCA), is imperative.; ","Black, E.

125,Epidemiology of major depression with atypical features: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC),"Objective: To examine prevalence, correlates, comorbidity and treatment-seeking among individuals with a lifetime major depressive episode (MDE) with and without atypical features. Method: Data were derived from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a large cross-sectional survey of a representative sample (N = 43,093) of the US population that assessed psychiatric disorders using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV). Comparison groups were defined based on the presence or absence of hypersomnia or hyperphagia in individuals who met criteria for lifetime DSM-IV MDE. Results: The presence of atypical features during an MDE was associated with greater rates of lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, including alcohol abuse, drug dependence, dysthymia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and any personality disorder (all P values < .05), except antisocial personality disorder, than MDE without atypical features. Compared with the latter group, MDE with atypical features was associated with female gender, younger age at onset, more MDEs, greater episode severity and disability, higher rates of family history of depression, bipolar I disorder, suicide attempts, and larger mental health treatment-seeking rates (all P values < .05). Conclusions: Our data provide further evidence for the clinical significance and validity of this depressive specifier. Based on the presence of any of the 2 reversed vegetative symptoms during an MDE, most of the commonly cited validators of atypical depression were confirmed in our study. Major depressive episode with atypical features may be more common, severe, and impairing than previously documented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

126,Health correlates of insomnia symptoms and comorbid mental disorders in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents,"Study Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and health correlates of insomnia symptoms and their association with comorbid mental disorders in a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the United States. Design: National representative cross-sectional study. Setting: Population-based sample from the US adolescents. Measurements and Results: A total of 6,483 individuals aged between 13-18 y in the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) with both individual and parental reports of mental health were included in this study. Participants were classified with insomnia symptoms if they reported difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and/or early morning awakening, nearly every day for at least 2 w in the past year. Nearly one-third of adolescents reported insomnia symptoms for at least 2 w during the previous year. Hispanic and black youth were significantly more likely to report insomnia symptoms (42.0% and 41.3%, respectively) than non-Hispanic white youth (30.4%). Adolescents with insomnia symptoms were at a higher risk for all classes of mental disorders {odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4 (2.9-4.0)} including mood, anxiety, behavioral, substance use, and eating disorders, suicidality [OR (95% CI): 2.63 (1.34-5.16)], poor perceived mental health [OR (95% CI): 2.01 (1.02-3.96)], chronic medical conditions [OR (95% CI): 1.94 (1.55-2.43)], smoking [OR (95% CI: 2.60 (1.00-6.72)], and obesity [OR (95% CI: 1.46 (1.10-1.93)] than those without insomnia symptoms. Adolescents with insomnia symptoms and comorbid mental disorders manifested even greater rates of these indicators of negative health behaviors and disorders than those with mental disorders alone (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms are reported by one-third of adolescents in the general population. Insomnia symptoms, even in the absence of concomitant depression or other mental disorders, are associated with serious health conditions, risk factors, and suicidality. Comorbid mental disorders potentiate the effect of insomnia symptoms on both physical and mental health. Further evaluation of the causes and effective interventions to reduce insomnia symptoms may have a significant effect on public health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

127,Short self-reported sleep duration and suicidal behavior: a cross-sectional study,"Background: Prior studies on the association between sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior did not explore whether or not short sleep is a marker of suicide intent, lethality or risk.; Design: Cross-sectional.; Participants: Suicide attempters (SAs) (n=434). Controls included 83 psychiatric inpatients who have never been SAs, and 509 healthy controls.; Measurements: Short sleep was defined by self-assessment as â‰¤ 5 h per day. The MINI and the DSM-IV version of the International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire were used to diagnose Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, respectively. Suicide intent and lethality were evaluated through the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS) and the Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS), respectively. Beck's Medical Lethality Scale (BMLS) was administered to assess the degree of medical injury, and the SAD PERSONS mnemonic scale was used to evaluate suicide risk.; Statistical Analyses: Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses explored frequencies of short sleep in 3 samples. Chi-square tests explored whether or not suicide intent, lethality and risk were greater in SAs with short-sleep versus those without short-sleep.; Results: Short sleep was more prevalent in SAs than in psychiatric controls only in males. In female SAs, short sleep was significantly associated with several SIS items and high scores in the SAD PERSONS.; Limitations: Sleep duration was assessed only by self-report.; Conclusions: The association between short sleep and suicidal behavior may be partly explained by confounders. Short sleep may be a marker of severity of suicidal behavior among female SAs.; Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

128,Neurotransmitter targeting in the treatment of depression,"Residual symptoms are a common hindrance to daily life for patients with major depressive disorder. Even after antidepressant treatment has led patients to meet remission criteria, almost all patients have at least 1 symptom that remains unresolved. These symptoms can increase the risk for relapse, a chronic course, and suicide attempts. Residual symptoms are lingering symptoms that do not resolve with treatment of the depressive episode, and they should be distinguished from symptoms of comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions and medication side effects. By understanding how various antidepressants affect the 3 monoamine systems of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, clinicians can select treatments based on the most effective mechanism of action. Dual-action agents show promise for alleviating depressive symptoms that do not resolve with single-action agents. Medications that increase norepinephrine or dopamine neurotransmission may improve several common residual symptoms left after treatment with serotonin-specific agents. Treatment strategies like adjunctive therapies and dosing options are given for common residual symptoms, including sleep difficulties, sexual dysfunction, and pain. For patients to truly regain their quality of life, clinicians must target residual symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

129,Health disparities among sexual minority women veterans,"Background: Lesbian and bisexual (i.e., sexual minority) identity is more common among women veterans than among male veterans. Unique health issues have been identified among women veterans and among sexual minority women, but little is known about women who are both sexual minorities and veterans. This study aimed to compare demographic and health information from sexual minority women veterans with sexual minority women non-veterans and heterosexual women veterans. Methods: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data were pooled from ten U.S. states that elected to ask sexual identity during 2010. The analytic sample was comprised of women who identified both their sexual identity and veteran status (n = 1,908). Mental health indicators were frequent mental distress, sleep problems, low social/emotional support, and low stagflation with life. Health risk indicators included current smoking, overweight, and obesity. Physical health status was defined by three components: disability requiring assertive equipment, > 14 days of poor physical health in the past 30 days, and activity limitations. Results: Compared with heterosexual women veterans, sexual minority women veterans had higher odds of mental distress (odds ratio [OR] = 3.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.61-5.70) and smoking (OR = 2.31, 95%CI: 1.19-4.48). After adjusting for demographic correlates, sexual minority women veterans had three times the odds of poor physical health (OR = 3.01, 95%CI: 1.51-5.99) than their sexual minority non-veteran peers. Conclusions: Results suggest sexual minority women veterans may experience unique health disparities relevant to provision of care in both Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA healthcare systems. Future research requires availability of data that include sexual minority status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

130,Sleep architecture in adolescents hospitalized during a suicidal crisis,"Objective/background: Rates of suicide attempts in Canadian youths are concerning. Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of both sleep and mood problems, two major risk factors for suicidality. This naturalistic study aimed to define the sleep profile of adolescents under the combined influence of suicidality, depression and pharmacotherapy during hospitalization for a suicidal crisis.; Patients/methods: Seventeen suicidal adolescents (15.0Â +Â 1.2years, 82% females) with major depression were recruited from a Canadian pedopsychiatric inpatient unit. Seventeen non-depressed adolescents were retrospectively collated from another database (15.0Â +Â 1.1years, 83% females). None of the participants had a history of sleep disorders or significant medical conditions.; Results: Compared to controls, suicidal adolescents had a longer sleep onset latency (ZÂ =Â -4.5, pÂ <Â 0.001), longer REM latency (ZÂ =Â -3.2, pÂ =Â 0.001), higher percentage of NREM1 sleep t(33)Â =Â -2.6, pÂ =Â 0.020), and higher REM density (ZÂ =Â -2.8, pÂ =Â 0.004) than controls. Higher REM density correlated with higher CDI-II scores (rÂ =Â 0.55, pÂ =Â 0.27) A significant interaction indicated that the two groups had similar NREM3 percentages in the first two-thirds of the night, but that the suicidal group had significantly lower NREM3 percentage than the controls in the last third of the night (F(2,66)Â =Â 3.4, pÂ =Â 0.041).; Conclusions: Significant sleep abnormalities were observed during hospitalization for a suicidal crisis in a sample of depressed and mostly medicated adolescents. This included sleep initiation and REM sleep latency abnormalities, shallower sleep and high REM density. Future studies should decipher the relative effects of depression, suicidality and medication on sleep. These findings stress the need to address sleep disturbances in the management of suicidality in adolescents.; Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

131,"Latent class analysis differentiation of adjustment disorder and demoralization, more severe depressive and anxiety disorders, and somatic symptoms in patients with cancer","Objectives: Demoralization as a form of existential distress involves poor coping, low morale, hopelessness, helplessness, and meaninglessness. In a secondary analysis of a cohort of German cancer patients, we aimed to explore latent class structure to assess the contribution that symptoms of demoralization make to anhedonic depression, anxiety, adjustment, and somatic disorders.; Methods: Measures of demoralization, depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, and functional impairment had been completed cross-sectionally by 1527 patients with early or advanced cancer. Latent class analysis used maximum likelihood techniques to define the unobserved latent constructs that can be predicted as symptom clusters. Individual patients were assigned to the most probable class. Classes were compared on demographics, and logistic regression assessed the odds of individual items predicting each class.; Results: A 4-class model provided the best fit. Class 1 (nÂ =Â 829, 54.3%) was defined by the absence of distress; Classes 2 to 4 all carried functional impairment. Class 2 (nÂ =Â 333, 21.8%) was differentiated by somatic symptoms (sleep, tiredness, and appetite); Class 3 (nÂ =Â 163, 10.7%) by anhedonia, anxiety, and severe demoralization; and Class 4 (nÂ =Â 202, 13.2%) by adjustment and moderate demoralization. Members of Class 3 were more likely to be younger, female, anhedonic, depressed, and anxious. In both Classes 3 and 4, functional impairment, physical symptom burden, and suicidal ideation were present.; Conclusions: In contrast with the severe symptom cluster carrying anhedonia, anxiety, and demoralization, the moderate symptom cluster was formed by patients with demoralization and impaired functioning, a clinical picture consistent with a unidimensional model of adjustment disorder.; Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.adjustment disorder, anhedonia, anxiety, demoralization, depression, existential distress, latent class analysis, suicidality","Bobevski, I.; Kissane, D.

132,"The influence of symptoms of prolonged grief disorder, depression, and anxiety on quality of life among bereaved adults: a prospective study","Objective: Research has shown that symptoms of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD, formerly called Complicated Grief) are distinct from those of depression and anxiety, and have incremental validity in that they predict impairments in functioning, independent of depression and anxiety. This study sought to replicate these findings using a prospective design, a heterogeneous sample of mourners, and the most recent criteria to define PGD.; Method: Data from 346 mourners who were bereaved between 6 months and 2 years and who were recruited from professional and lay mental health care workers and the Internet, were used in a confirmatory factor analysis to determine the distinctiveness of symptoms of PGD, depression, and anxiety. Regression analyses estimated the effects of symptoms of PGD, depression, and anxiety on quality of life and mental health 6 months (T2) and 15 months (T3) after baseline, in a subgroup of 96 mourners assessed at follow-up.; Results: PGD, depression, and anxiety represented three distinct factors. When we controlled the influence of relevant background variables but not the shared variance between the factors, all three factors predicted quality of life and mental health outcomes at T2 and T3. When we controlled the shared variance between factors, the PGD factor at T1 predicted unique variance in four outcomes at T2 (mental health, suicidal ideation, PGD severity, and depression severity) and two outcomes at T3 (mental health and PGD severity), the depression factor in one outcome at T2 (depression severity) but none at T3, and the anxiety factor in six outcomes at T2 (mental health, energy, general health perception, sleeping problems, depression severity, and anxiety severity) and one at T3 (anxiety severity).; Conclusions: We found PGD (defined according to the newest criteria) to be distinct from depression and anxiety and to be predictive of reduced quality of life and mental health. The concept of PGD is needed to detect mourners at risk for health impairments, who would go undetected with an exclusive focus on depression or anxiety.;Grief*, Anxiety/*etiology, Depression/*etiology, Adult, Anxiety/psychology, Depression/psychology, Factor Analysis, Statistical, Family Relations, Female, Health, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Quality of Life, Sleep Wake Disorders/chemically induced, Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology, Social Behavior, Suicide/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires","Boelen, Paul A & Prigerson, Holly G",0,132

There were few differences between males and females. Children and adults were compared. Most adults with PWS had good self-care skills and good use of speech. Most adults walked without problems but many needed help to dress. PWS adults had more problems than children with daytime sleepiness and other sleep problems, unusual routines and self-injury; and fewer problems with faddy eating, verbal abuse and stubbornness. Changeable mood was a problem for both adults and children, adults had more problems with low mood. The authors conclude by suggesting study weaknesses and future research directions.

134,Determinants of thoughts of death or suicide in depressed older persons,"Background: In depressed persons, thoughts of death and suicide are assumed to represent different degrees of a construct: suicidality. However, this can be questioned in older persons facing physical and social losses. Thoughts of death in depressed older persons are hardly examined in the absence of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, most depression instruments do not discriminate suicidal ideation from thoughts of death only. We examined whether determinants of thoughts of death differ from determinants of suicidal ideation in late life depression. Methods: Past month's thoughts of death and suicidal ideation were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in 378 depressed older persons (>60 years of age). Multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and depression severity were used to identify socio-demographic, lifestyle, clinical and somatic determinants of past month's thoughts of death, and suicidal ideation. Results: Compared with patients without thoughts of death or suicide (n = 267), patients reporting thoughts of death but no suicidal ideation (n = 74) were older (OR (95% confidence interval) = 1.04 (1.00-1.08)) and more severely depressed (OR = 1.06 (1.04-1.08)), whereas patients with suicidal ideation (n = 37) were also more severely depressed (OR = 1.09 (1.06-1.13)), but not older. This latter group was further characterized by more psychiatric comorbidity (dysthymia OR = 2.28 (1.08-4.85)), panic disorder (OR = 2.27 (1.00-518)), at-risk alcohol use (OR = 4.10 (1.42-11.90)), lifetime suicide attempts (OR = 3.37 (1.46-7.75)), loneliness (OR = 1.24 (1.07-1.43)), and recent life events (OR = 3.14 (1.48-6.67)). Conclusions: In depressed older persons thoughts of death and suicide differ in relevant demographic, social, and clinical characteristics, suggesting that the risks and consequences of the two conditions differ.

136,Effectiveness of a transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based and mobile-supported intervention for the indicated prevention of depression and anxiety (ICare Prevent) in Dutch college students: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Depression and anxiety are common and co-morbid disorders that affect a significant proportion of students. Innovative prevention strategies targeting both conditions are needed to reduce their health burden and costs. ICare Prevent is such an innovative strategy and contains a transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based and mobile-supported intervention. It addresses common risk factors of depression and anxiety as part of a large EU-funded multi-country project* (ICare). Little is known about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention compared to care as usual (CAU) for college students. We hypothesize that ICare Prevent will be more (cost-)effective than CAU in the reduction of symptoms of depression and anxiety.; Methods: A three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled superiority trial will be conducted comparing a guided and an unguided version of ICare Prevent with a control group receiving CAU. The trial will be open-label but outcome assessors will be blinded. A total of 252 college students (ageâ€‰â‰¥â€‰16Â years) with subclinical symptoms of depression defined as a scoreâ€‰â‰¥â€‰16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and/or anxiety, defined as a scoreâ€‰â‰¥â€‰5 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), will be included. Those meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder will be excluded. The primary outcome is change in disorder specific symptom severity from baseline to post-intervention. Secondary endpoints include self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms as well as time to onset of a mood or anxiety disorder until 12-month follow-up. Societal costs and quality of life will be assessed to estimate the intervention's cost-effectiveness compared to CAU.; Discussion: Transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based prevention could be a (cost-)effective approach to tackle the disease burden of depression and anxiety among college students.; Trial Registration: Dutch trial register, NTR 6562 .

137,Characteristics of university students who mix alcohol and energy drinks,"Objective: Research has identified correlates (eg, drug use, risky sex, smoking) of using alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AMEDs). Few studies have investigated common mental health-related concerns (eg, depression, sleep). Participants: Alcohol-using college students (n = 380 never used AMEDs, n = 180 used AMEDs) were recruited in the study during the fall 2011 semester. Methods: The study examined demographics, substance use, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems in association with AMED use. Results: Multivariable logistic regression indicated that alcohol use severity (AOR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.14 + 1.34), drug use severity (AOR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.04â€“1.39), depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.01â€“1.12), and smoking (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.22â€“3.68) were independently associated with AMED use; sleep problems were non-significant. Conclusions: Administrators may consider policies regarding energy drink availability on campus, and campus health personnel may increase screening and education surrounding AMED use to reduce risks among students.

138,Who are the adolescents who stop smoking?,"Unlabelled: In most industrialised countries, the number of adolescent smokers has increased dramatically during the past several years. Encouraging smokers to quit constitutes one of several methods to control smoking. To improve our understanding of quitting during adolescence and help professionals address the specific attributes and needs of those who quit, we compared the characteristics of youth who report having quit (former smokers, FS) with those of both regular"" smokers (RS) and nonsmokers (NS). As part of the Swiss Multicentre Adolescent Survey on Health anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a national representative sample of 9268 15- to 20-year-old teenagers. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed FS to differ from NS for the following variables: suicide attempt (odds ratio OR 2.10); sleeping difficulties (OR 1.67); delinquency (1.61); assault (OR 1.55); painting of graffiti (OR 1.52); shoplifting (OR 1.51); dissatisfaction with academic choices (OR 1.46); suffering from back problems (OR 1.31); belonging to a sports club (OR 0.78); receiving good marks at school (OR 0.75); and having a positive future expectation with regard to health (OR 0.74). FS differed from RS for the following variables: practising sport (OR 2.18); scouting (OR: 1.97); shoplifting (OR 0.63); tardiness (OR 0.63 and having many friends (OR 0.59).; Conclusion: Former smokers resemble regular smokers as far as mental health and general health are concerned whereas they behave similarly to nonsmokers in the field of social and sports activities.; ""Smoking Prevention*, Smoking Cessation/*statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Analysis of Variance, Confidence Intervals, Female, Humans, Incidence, Logistic Models, Male, Odds Ratio, Population Surveillance, Reference Values, Risk Factors, Sex Distribution, Smoking/epidemiology, Socioeconomic Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Switzerland/epidemiology","Bonard, L.; Janin-Jacquat, B. & Michaud, P.

139,Association of traumatic police event exposure with sleep quality and quantity in the BCOPS Study cohort,"Police officers are exposed to traumatic and life-threatening events, which may lead to sleep problems. Prior studies of police officers have found them to have poor sleep quality and reduced sleep time. This study examined associations between traumatic events and sleep quality. Participants were 372 police officers from the Buffalo Cardio-metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) Study. Police incidents were measured by the Police Incident Survey; sleep quality and quantity were derived from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine mean PSQI scores across categories of traumatic event frequency. Models were adjusted for age, education and ethnicity and stratified by sex and workload. In men, significant associations were found for the 'shooting of another officer' and sleep quality (p-value = 0.024) and sleep disturbances (p-value = 0.022). In women, seeing more 'abused children' was associated with poorer sleep quality (p-value = 0.050); increasing frequency of 'seeing victims of a serious traffic accident' was associated with shorter sleep duration (p-value = 0.032). Increased frequency of 'seeing dead bodies' was associated with poorer sleep quality (p-value = 0.040) and shorter sleep duration (p-value = 0.048). Among women with a high workload, a significant inverse association was found between 'seeing serious traffic accident victims' and global sleep quality (p-value = 0.031). In conclusion, a significant inverse association between frequency of select traumatic events and sleep quality was found in male and female police officers. The significant events differed by sex. Future research could examine longitudinal associations between career-long traumatic event exposures and sleep quality and how these associations differ by sex.; Life Change Events*, Police*/statistics & numerical data, Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology, Sleep Wake Disorders/*epidemiology, Adult, Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Statistical, New York/epidemiology, Occupational Diseases/etiology, Sex Factors, Sleep/physiology, Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology, Time Factors","Bond, Jonathan; Hartley, Tara A.; Sarkisian, Khachatur; Andrew, Michael E.; Charles, Luenda E.; Violanti, John M. & Burchfiel, Cecil M.",1,139
140,Death in patients with adaptive servo-ventilation for sleep apnea and no specific SERVE-HF profile: A case series study,"Purpose: The SERVE-HF study reported a risk of cardiovascular death associated with adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) for central sleep apnea in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Therefore, we adopted in May 2015 a safety procedure in our 32 patients with ASV since 2006. It led to ASV removal in four patients due to â‰¤45% LVEF. At the end of the procedure we noted eight cases of death. This high 25% mortality rate led us to study these cases.; Methods: The study population was derived from our database of patient follow-up from the sleep unit of our cardiovascular department.; Results: All deceased patients but one had cardiac disorders but only one matched the SERVE-HF patient profile. ASV was due to predominant central (nâ€¯=â€¯4) or mixed (nâ€¯=â€¯4) sleep apnea. Six patients died prior to our procedure including two patients who died several months after ASV cessation, one from ventricular fibrillation and one from respiratory infection. The cases with ongoing ASV consisted in one case of end-stage heart failure with asystole, two cases of cancer and one case of suicide. Two patients died after their safety procedure with no contra-indications to ASV and before study completion in all the patients, one from cancer and one from pulmonary and renal disorders.; Conclusions: In this series, no relationship became apparent between sleep apnea or ASV and death. Cardiovascular deaths were not predominant.

141,"Risk profile of young people admitted to hospital for suicidal behaviour in Melbourne, Australia","Aim: Self-harm and suicidal behaviour is most prevalent during adolescence, but little is known about the risk profile of adolescents admitted to hospital for suicidal behaviour. Young people who self-harm are at an increased risk of mortality compared to those who do not self-harm; adolescents admitted to hospital for suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. The aim of this study was to generate a risk profile of adolescents admitted to hospital with suicidal behaviour.; Methods: We conducted a 12-month retrospective audit of adolescent admissions to the mental health inpatient unit at a tertiary children's hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Routinely collected data were used to generate a risk profile.; Results: We found that 212 of 271 (78.2%) admissions were due to suicidal behaviour. Of these, 107 (51%) adolescents were diagnosed with one or more mental disorders at discharge, most commonly major depressive disorder. Beyond known distal determinants of health risk, the proximal risk profile of these adolescents included factors relating to gender, substance use, prior mental health diagnoses and prior admission to hospital. Poor sleep was also a risk factor, with 159 (75%) reporting a recent history of sleeping problems.; Conclusions: The very high proportion of admissions to the mental health inpatient unit due to suicidal behaviour reinforces the importance of finding effective methods of identification of the risk processes underpinning suicidal behaviours to reduce the unnecessary waste of young lives by suicide.; Â© 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).adolescent, hospital admission, mental health, suicidal behaviour","Borschmann, Rohan; Stark, Patrick; Prakash, Chidambaram & Sawyer, Susan M.",0,141
142,Mental health impact of homecoming experience among 1730 formerly deployed veterans from the Vietnam war to current conflicts: Results from the Veterans' health study,"We examined the effects of homecoming support on current mental health among 1730 deployed veterans from Vietnam, Iraq/Afghanistan, Persian Gulf, and other conflicts. The prevalence of current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 5.4%, current depression was 8.3%, and 5.4% had suicidal thoughts in the past month. Overall, 26% of veterans had low homecoming support, which was more prevalent among Vietnam veterans (44.3%, p < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regressions, controlling for demographics, combat exposure, number of deployments, trauma history, and operational theater, low postdeployment support was associated with PTSD (odds ratio, 2.13; p = 0.032) and suicidality (odds ratio, 1.91; p < 0.030), but not depression. For suicidality, an interaction was detected for homecoming by theater status, whereby Iraq/Afghanistan veterans with lower homecoming support had a higher probability of suicidal thoughts (p = 0.002). Thus, years after deployment, lower homecoming support was associated with current PTSD and suicidality, regardless of theater and warzone exposures. For suicidality, lower support had a greater impact on Iraq/Afghanistan veterans.

143,Opioid-use disorder among patients on long-term opioid therapy: impact of final DSM-5 diagnostic criteria on prevalence and correlates,"Aims: Previously, we estimated the prevalence and risk factors for prescription opioid-use disorder among outpatients on opioid therapy using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 and DSM-4 criteria. However, at the time, the DSM-5 criteria were not finalized. In the current study, we analyzed these data using the final DSM-5 criteria and compared these results.; Methods: Using electronic records from a large US health care system, we identified outpatients receiving five or more prescription orders for opioid therapy in the past 12 months for noncancer pain (mean prescription orders =10.72; standard deviation =4.96). In 2008, we completed diagnostic interviews with 705 of these patients using the DSM-4 criteria. In the current study, we reassessed these results using the final DSM-5 criteria.; Results: The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 opioid-use disorders using the final DSM-5 criteria was 58.7% for no or few symptoms (<2), 28.1% for mild symptoms (2-3), 9.7% for moderate symptoms (4-5), and 3.5% for severe symptoms (six or more). Thus, the lifetime prevalence of any"" prescription opioid-use disorder in this cohort was 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] =37.6-45.0). A comparison to the DSM-4 criteria indicated that the majority of patients with lifetime DSM-4 opioid dependence were now classified as having mild opioid-use disorder based on the DSM-5 criteria (53.6%; 95% CI =44.1-62.8). In ordinal logistic regression predicting no/few mild moderate and severe opioid-use disorder the best predictors were age <65 years current pain impairment trouble sleeping suicidal thoughts anxiety disorders illicit drug use and history of substance abuse treatment.; Conclusion: Given the final DSM-5 criteria including the elimination of tolerance and withdrawal inclusion of craving and abuse symptoms and introduction of a new graded severity classification the prevalence of opioid-use disorders has changedDSM-5, drug-use disorders, opioids, outpatients, pain, prescription drugs","Boscarino, Joseph A.; Hoffman, Stuart N. & Han, John J.",1,143
144,A brief screening tool for assessing psychological trauma in clinical practice: Development and validation of the New York PTSD Risk Score,"Objective: The objective was to develop a brief posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) screening instrument that is useful in clinical practice, similar to the Framingham Risk Score used in cardiovascular medicine. Methods: We used data collected in New York City after the World Trade Center disaster (WTCD) and other trauma data to develop a new PTSD prediction tool--the New York PTSD Risk Score. We used diagnostic test methods to examine different clinical domains, including PTSD symptoms, trauma exposures, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts, depression symptoms, demographic factors and other measures to assess different PTSD prediction models. Results: Using receiver operating curve (ROC) and bootstrap methods, five prediction domains, including core PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbance, access to care status, depression symptoms and trauma history, and five demographic variables, including gender, age, education, race and ethnicity, were identified. For the best prediction model, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.880 for the Primary Care PTSD Screen alone (specificity = 82.2%, sensitivity = 93.7%). Adding care status, sleep disturbance, depression and trauma exposure increased the AUC to 0.943 (specificity = 85.7%, sensitivity = 93.1%), a significant ROC improvement (P < .0001). Adding demographic variables increased the AUC to 0.945, which was not significant (P = .250). To externally validate these models, we applied the WTCD results to 705 pain patients treated at a multispecialty group practice and to 225 trauma patients treated at a Level I Trauma Center. These results validated those from the original WTCD development and validation samples. Conclusion: The New York PTSD Risk Score is a multifactor prediction tool that includes the Primary Care PTSD Screen, depression symptoms, access to care, sleep disturbance, trauma history and demographic variables and appears to be effective in predicting PTSD among patients seen in healthcare settings. This prediction tool is simple to administer and appears to outperform other screening measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

145,Mental health outcomes among vulnerable residents after Hurricane Sandy: implications for disaster research and planning,"Objective: To evaluate mental health outcomes among New Jersey shore residents with health impairments and disabilities after Hurricane Sandy.; Design and Setting: Six months following Hurricane Sandy, a cross-sectional survey of 200 adults residing in beach communities directly exposed to the storm located in Monmouth County, NJ, was conducted.; Main Outcome Measures: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, mental health service use, and medication use.; Results: The average age of residents surveyed was 59 years (SD = 13.7) and 52.5 percent (95% CI = 45.5-59.4) reported recent hospitalizations, physical limitations, fair to poor health status, multiple chronic health conditions, or physical disabilities. A total of 14.5 percent (95% CI = 10.2-20.1) of residents screened positive for PTSD and 6.0 percent (95% CI = 3.1-10.2) met criteria for depression 6 months after Sandy. In addition, 20.5 percent (95% CI = 15.4-26.7) sought some type of professional counseling after Sandy and 30.5 percent (95% CI = 24.5-37.3) experienced PTSD symptoms, depression, sought professional mental health support, or used psychotropic medications. In multivariate analyses, the best predictors of mental health and service use were having sleep problems, suicidal thoughts, moderate or severe pain, and having high exposure hurricane-related events. Analyses also suggested that noncollege graduates were more likely to receive mental health services (OR = 3.10, p = 0.009), while women were less likely to have depression (OR = 0.12, p = 0.038).; Conclusion: Having physical impairments and health conditions were not directly related to adverse mental health outcomes following Sandy, but having sleep problems, pain, or suicidal thoughts were.

146,Development and validation of a 6-day standard for the identification of frequent mental distress,"Purpose: The goals of the current study were to assess the concurrent validity of a single-item measure of general mental distress with established, multi-item mental health measures used in population-level surveillance and to establish the optimal cutpoint for determining psychological distress (previously identified as frequent mental distress) using recently available data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey.; Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the core questionnaire and two optional modules available as part of the 2006 and 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. Frequent mental distress (FMD) was identified by the number of days of self-reported poor mental health during the last 30 days. Comparisons of the number of days with poor mental health and positive scores for measures of depression and serious mental illness were calculated to identify the most efficient cutpoint for establishing FMD.; Results: Comparisons of results obtained from ROC analyses using the PHQ-8 and K6 reported 0.867 (95% CI 0.861-0.872) and 0.840 (95% CI 0.836-0.845) of the area under the curve, respectively, suggesting good accuracy. Using the Youden index, 6 days of poor mental health in the past 30 days, rather than the existing 14-day standard, was identified as the point at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity was greatest.; Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that a 6-day standard (FMD-6) can be used as a valid and reliable indicator of generalized mental distress with strong associations to both diagnosable depressive symptomology and serious mental illness.; Mental Disorders/*diagnosis, Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Area Under Curve, Ethnic Groups/psychology, Ethnic Groups/statistics & numerical data, Female, Guam, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders/ethnology, Mental Disorders/psychology, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, Population Surveillance/methods, Predictive Value of Tests, Puerto Rico, ROC Curve, Reproducibility of Results, Risk Factors, Self Report, Sensitivity and Specificity, Time Factors, United States, United States Virgin Islands, Young Adult","Bossarte, Robert M.; He, Hua; Claassen, Cynthia A.; Knox, Kerry & Tu, Xin",0,146
147,Differential associations between depressive symptoms and glycaemic control in outpatients with diabetes,"Aims: Depression is common in people with diabetes, and related to higher HbA(1c) levels. Depression, however, is a heterogeneous construct that involves a variety of symptoms. As little is known about the associations of individual depressive symptoms with HbA(1c), we explored these associations in outpatients with diabetes.; Methods: The study was conducted in three tertiary diabetes clinics in the Netherlands. At baseline, the presence of the nine depressive symptoms that are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition was assessed with the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). At baseline and after a 1-year follow-up, HbA(1c) was derived from the medical charts.; Results: A total of 288 out of 646 subjects with diabetes (45%) reported one or more depressive symptom(s). Depressed mood (Î² = 0.11, P = 0.005), sleeping difficulties (Î² = 0.16, P < 0.001), appetite problems (Î² = 0.15, P < 0.001) and suicidal ideation (Î² = 0.14, P = 0.001) were significantly related to higher baseline HbA(1c) values. Furthermore, depressed mood (Î² = 0.09, P = 0.03) sleeping difficulties (Î² = 0.12, P = 0.004), appetite problems (Î² = 0.11, P = 0.01) and psychomotor agitation/retardation (Î² = 0.09, P = 0.04) were significantly related to higher HbA(1c) values at 1-year follow-up. Associations were more pronounced in Type 1 diabetes than in Type 2 diabetes. None of the depressive symptoms were related to change in HbA(1c) over time, except suicidal ideation.; Conclusion: In people with diabetes, several individual depressive symptoms were related to higher HbA(1c) levels.

148,Flunarizine- and topiramate-associated depression responsive to Mirtazapine,"Presents a case report of a 54-year-old woman, who had no psychiatric history until her early 40s, when she underwent unsuccessful in-vitro fertilization (IVF). In that context, she developed an episode of major depression, treated with escitalopram 20 mg/d. Her episode resolved and she continued escitalopram, which was maintained during her perimenopausal years. At age 50 years, she developed a complex seizure and hemiplegic migraine disorder. This required various medications with incomplete relief. At age 54 years, she had a hospitalization for IV valproate and initiation of oral flunarizine 5 mg daily and topiramate 100 mg bid. Her migraine symptoms were thereafter well controlled. However, her migraine symptoms recurred and she restarted flunarizine 4 days later, with subsequent control of her migraine symptoms. Her mood continued to be improved on her new medication regimen and she had no further suicidal ideation. On post-discharge follow-up at 1 week and, subsequently, at 1 month her mood continued to improve, while sleep, appetite and energy normalized. Escitalopram was discontinued and mirtazapine was continued. Under direction of her neurologist, flunarizine and topiramate were continued with close monitoring of symptom (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)flunarizine, topiramate, depression responses, mirtazapine, migraine, suicidal ideation, Drug Therapy, Major Depression, Migraine Headache, Suicidal Ideation, Treatment Outcomes","Bourgeois, James A. & Hategan, Ana",0,148

150,A different depression: Clinical distinctions between bipolar and unipolar depression,"Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis can prolong the suffering of patients with bipolar disorder. Accurate early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, however, particularly because patients often present in the depressive phase, which can easily be mistaken for unipolar depression. Unfortunately, therapy appropriate for unipolar depression can increase the risk of manic switch or cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder, especially in those with a family history of bipolarity and suicide, although some antidepressants may be useful in some bipolar patients. In addition, most currently available mood stabilizers, though effective in managing mania, do not effectively resolve depression. In contrast, lamotrigine has shown activity in bipolar depression and has a very low risk of manic switch. Bipolar depression, compared with unipolar depression, is more likely to be associated with hypersomnia, motor retardation, mood lability, early onset, and a family history of bipolar disorder. Awareness of these distinctions can greatly improve diagnosis of bipolar disorder and provide an opportunity for effective therapeutic intervention.

151,The safety profile of paroxetine,"Side effects remain one of the most important clinical issues in antidepressant therapy. Patients may not be able to take appropriate treatment or may not tolerate their medication in adequate doses or for an adequate length of time to manage their depressive illness. This article reviews the extensive safety data from 6705 patients treated with paroxetine. These data indicate that paroxetine has no significant cardiovascular effects, few significant drug interactions, and no clinically significant effects on the ECG or EEG. Furthermore, paroxetine is relatively safe in overdose and has very little anticholinergic activity. Psychomotor performance is not impaired by paroxetine and there is no evidence of any zimelidine-like hypersensitivity reactions or increase in suicidal ideation. As with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common side effect is gastrointestinal upset, especially nausea. This is usually very well tolerated and rarely leads to drug discontinuation. As with other SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be prescribed concurrently or soon after discontinuing paroxetine because of the risk of a lethal interaction. Paroxetine may be less likely than currently available SSRIs to cause agitation. In general, paroxetine has a very favorable side effect profile and should be an important alternative in the medical treatment of depressive illness.;Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Piperidines/*adverse effects, Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/chemically induced, Cardiovascular System/drug effects, Clinical Trials as Topic, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Drug Interactions, Electrocardiography/drug effects, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neurocognitive Disorders/chemically induced, Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects, Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Paroxetine, Piperidines/therapeutic use, Placebos, Psychomotor Performance/drug effects, Sleep/drug effects","Boyer, W F & Blumhardt, C L",0,151
152,Linking insomnia and suicide ideation in college females: The role of socio-cognitive variables and depressive symptoms in suicide risk,"Background: Although insomnia symptoms are associated with risk of suicide ideation, the means by which insomnia influences ideation, as well as the role depression plays in these relationships, require further study. In this study, we examined whether certain socio-cognitive variables (fatigue, social problem-solving, and hopelessness) in conjunction with depression explained this relationship among female college students. Methods: 483 female students completed measures assessing insomnia and depressive symptoms, fatigue, social problem-solving ability, hopelessness, and suicide ideation. Results: Path analyses indicated that socio-cognitive variables partially explained the insomnia-ideation relationship above the influence of depressive symptoms. Higher depressive symptoms exacerbated relationships between social problem-solving and hopelessness, heightening ideation risk. Conclusions: Our findings expand knowledge of intermediate socio-cognitive variables that may contribute to the insomnia-ideation relationship, and indicate that clinically-severe depressive symptoms compound the contribution of negative self and future appraisals to thoughts of suicide. Suicidal females with insomnia and depressive symptoms may benefit from interventions targeting problem-solving skills and improving sleep.

Roth (see record [rid]2011-14984-002[/rid]) and S. J. Mathew et al. (see record [rid]2011-14984-004[/rid]). These three papers identify opportunities and challenges to translate advances in basic and clinical neuroscience into novel medications to treat mood and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Some common themes emerge from these papers. The authors identify the need to develop novel mechanism of action therapeutics based on validated molecular targets. The authors summarize the variable degree of predictive value that existing preclinical models have in assessing efficacy in the majority of psychiatric disorders. The authors suggest targeting core phenotypic domains of dysfunction within and across psychiatric disorders, such as cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, sleep disturbances in post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide across multiple disorders. The papers cite significant opportunities as well as challenges for system-level approaches to facilitate the translation of basic discoveries into validated drug targets and new models of impaired domains of function. These opportunities have the potential to introduce innovation along the critical path for psychiatric drug discovery.

154,Deployment-related insomnia in military personnel and veterans,"Insomnia is a prevalent disorder that greatly impacts military personnel, especially those deployed in support of combat efforts. Deployment-related stressors like combat exposure, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) irregular sleep-wake schedules, and adjustment to the return home all contribute to insomnia. However, insomnia can also exacerbate the deployment experience and is a risk factor for traumatic stress reactions such as PTSD, depression, and suicide. Military personnel with mTBI are significantly impacted by insomnia; the majority experience sleep disruption and this can impede recovery and rehabilitation. As more service members return home from deployment, treatment is vital to reduce the impact of insomnia. Preliminary outcome data, showing positive results for reduction of sleep disruption, has been found with treatments such as combined cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBTI) and imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), preference-based interventions, as well as efforts to broadly disseminate CBTI.

155,Maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Randomized withdrawal design,"Objective: To evaluate lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: Adults (aged 18-55 years) who had ADHD meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria, baseline ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) with adult prompts total scores of < 22, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) ratings of 1, 2, or 3 were enrolled. After previously receiving commercially available lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) for â‰¥ 6 months with acceptable tolerability and maintaining response during a 3-week open-label phase at a stable lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose, the participants entered a 6-week double-blind randomized withdrawal phase on treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (same dose) or placebo. Data were collected from April 2009 to July 2010. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having symptom relapse (â‰¥ 50% increase in ADHD-RS-IV score and â‰¥ 2 rating-point increase in CGI-S score). Results: A total of 116 participants were randomized (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate n = 56; placebo n = 60). At the randomized withdrawal phase baseline, mean (SD) ADHD-RS-IV scores for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo were 10.6 (4.96) and 10.6 (4.82), respectively. At endpoint, 8.9% (5/56) of adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 75.0% (45/60) taking placebo (P < .0001) showed symptom relapse; most showed relapse after 1 and 2 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase (4 and 0 adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 26 and 10 taking placebo, respectively). During the randomized withdrawal phase, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 48.2% and 30.0% of participants in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events with incidence â‰¥ 5% in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups were headache (14.3% and 5.0%), insomnia (5.4% and 5.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (8.9% and 0%). Conclusion: In adults with ADHD on medium- to long-term treatment, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate demonstrated maintenance of efficacy vs placebo upon randomized withdrawal. A majority of patients given placebo showed symptom relapse by 2 weeks. The safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was generally consistent with previous lisdexamfetamine dimesylate studies.

156,Recent Regulatory Changes in Antidepressant Labels: Implications of Activation (Stimulation) for Clinical Practice,"Recent attention has been given to the risk of suicidality associated with antidepressants. More focus is needed on the risk of activation or stimulation as described in the new class warnings from the Food and Drug Administration, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, and other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation. The medications most commonly associated with activation are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as well as bupropion and venlafaxine. It is important for physicians to identify these relatively common adverse drug reactions as early as possible and to respond when necessary by reducing the dose or withdrawing the medication on a safe schedule. Careful monitoring and patient education can help to prevent activation with the potential for harm to self or others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

158,"Military-Related Exposures, Social Determinants of Health, and Dysbiosis: The United States-Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP)","Significant effort has been put forth to increase understanding regarding the role of the human microbiome in health- and disease-related processes. In turn, the United States (US) Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) was conceptualized as a means by which to serially collect microbiome and health-related data from those seeking care within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In this manuscript, exposures related to military experiences, as well as conditions and health-related factors among patients seen in VHA clinical settings are discussed in relation to common psychological and physical outcomes. Upon enrollment in the study, Veterans complete psychometrically sound (i.e., reliable and valid) measures regarding their past and current medical history. Participants also provide skin, oral, and gut microbiome samples, and permission to track their health status via the VHA electronic medical record. To date, data collection efforts have been cross-diagnostic. Within this manuscript, we describe current data collection practices and procedures, as well as highlight demographic, military, and psychiatric characteristics of the first 188 Veterans enrolled in the study. Based on these findings, we assert that this cohort is unique as compared to those enrolled in recent large-scale studies of the microbiome. To increase understanding regarding disease and health among diverse cohorts, efforts such as the US-VMP are vital. Ongoing barriers and facilitators to data collection are discussed, as well as future research directions, with an emphasis on the importance of shifting current thinking regarding the microbiome from a focus on normalcy and dysbiosis to health promotion and disease prevention",Brenner LA; Hoisington AJ; Stearns-Yoder KA; Stamper CE; Heinze JD; Postolache TT; Hadidi DA; Hoffmire CA; Stanislawski MA; Lowry CA,0,158
159,Psychiatric Sequelae of Concussions,"Purpose Of Review: The purpose of this study was to review the frequency, risk factors, phenomenology, and course of prolonged recovery from concussion and of psychiatric sequelae in pediatric populations.; Recent Findings: Youth with prolonged recovery from concussions have higher initial symptoms, a history of multiple and/or recent concussions, and a tendency to somatization. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, behavioral disorders, and perhaps, suicidal behavior disorder are more common as both short- and longer-term sequelae of concussions. The weight of evidence supports a graduated return to function as compared to prolonged rest, which may actually impede recovery. For those with prolonged recovery, cognitive behavior therapy aimed at education about concussions, improving coping, problem-solving, sleep hygiene, and dealing with anxiety and depression provided in a collaborative care model is superior to usual care. Concussed youth have an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbance that can be prevented or treated with proper management.; Brain Concussion/*psychology, Brain Concussion/complications, Brain Concussion/diagnosis, Brain Concussion/rehabilitation, Child, Depressive Disorder/complications, Depressive Disorder/therapy, Disease Progression, Humans, Risk Factors, Sleep Wake Disorders/complications, Sleep Wake Disorders/therapy, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/complications, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/prevention & control, Suicidal Ideation, Management, Pediatric concussion, Post-concussion syndrome, Psychiatric disorder","Brent, David A. & Max, Jeffrey",0,159
160,Protecting adolescents from self-harm: A critical review of intervention studies,"Objective: To review the studies that test treatments targeting adolescent suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or self-harm, and to make recommendations for future intervention development. Method: The extant randomized clinical trials that aim to reduce the intensity of suicidal ideation or the recurrence of suicide attempts or self-harm were reviewed with respect to treatment components, comparison treatments, sample composition, and outcomes. Results: The majority of studies that showed any effect on suicidal ideation, attempts, or self-harm had some focus on family interactions or nonfamilial sources of support. Two of the most efficacious interventions also provided the greatest number of sessions. Some other treatment elements associated with positive effects include addressing motivation for treatment and having explicit plans for integrating the experimental treatment with treatment as usual. In many studies, suicidal events tend to occur very early in the course of treatment prior to when an effective â€œdoseâ€ of treatment could be delivered. Important factors that might mitigate suicidal risk, such as sobriety, healthy sleep, and promotion of positive affect, were not addressed in most studies. Conclusion: Interventions that can front-load treatment shortly after the suicidal crisis, for example, while adolescent suicide attempters are hospitalized, may avert early suicidal events. Treatments that focus on the augmentation of protective factors, such as parent support and positive affect, as well as the promotion of sobriety and healthy sleep, may be beneficial with regard to the prevention of recurrent suicidal ideation, attempts, or self-harm in adolescents.

161,Sleep disturbance and psychiatric disorders: a longitudinal epidemiological study of young adults,"In a longitudinal epidemiological study of young adults, we estimated the association between sleep disturbance and psychiatric disorders, cross-sectionally and prospectively. A random sample of 1200 was drawn from all 21-30-year-old members of a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in Michigan; 1007 were interviewed in 1989 and 979 were reinterviewed in 1992. Lifetime prevalence of insomnia alone was 16.6%, of hypersomnia alone, 8.2%, and of insomnia plus hypersomnia, 8%. The gender-adjusted relative risk for new onset of major depression during the follow-up period in persons with history of insomnia at baseline was 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-7.0) and in persons with baseline history of hypersomnia, 2.9 (95% CI 1.5-5.6). When history of other prior depressive symptoms (e.g., psychomotor retardation or agitation, suicidal ideation) was controlled for, prior insomnia remained a significant predictor of subsequent major depression. Complaints of 2 weeks or more of insomnia nearly every night might be a useful marker of subsequent onset of major depression.;Mental Disorders/*epidemiology, Sleep Wake Disorders/*epidemiology, Adult, Comorbidity, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/epidemiology, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/diagnosis, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/epidemiology, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/psychology, Female, Humans, Incidence, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Mental Disorders/psychology, Michigan/epidemiology, Prospective Studies, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology","Breslau, N; Roth, T; Rosenthal, L & Andreski, P",1,161

Methods: Within this sample, we compared a group with 1 or more documented psychiatric symptoms (68.5%) to a group with no such symptoms (31.5%). The groups were compared on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, somatic symptoms, and stressors using the Ï‡Â² test and on time to death after the last visit using survival analyses. Results: Veterans with documented psychiatric symptoms were more likely to receive a suicide risk assessment, and have suicidal ideation and a suicide plan, sleep problems, pain, and several stressors. These veterans were also more likely to die in the 60 days after their last visit. Conclusions: Findings indicated presence of 2 large and distinct groups of veterans at risk for suicide in the VHA, underscoring the value of tailored prevention strategies, including approaches suitable for those without identified psychiatric symptoms.

163,Insomnia and risk for suicidal behavior: A test of a mechanistic transdiagnostic model in veterans,"Background: Insomnia has been shown to have direct and indirect associations with suicidal ideation, attempts, and death in U.S. military and veteran populations. However, transdiagnostic models of insomnia and psychopathology have not been used to examine the contribution of psychopathology.; Method: The present study is a secondary analysis examining the associations among insomnia symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms, interpersonal theory of suicide variables, and risk for suicidal behavior in community veterans (nâ€¯=â€¯392). Serial mediation was used to test sequential associations, allowing for examination of direct and indirect associations.; Results: The model with insomnia, PTSD, and depressive symptoms, and thwarted belongingness, accounted for 29% of the variance in risk. Insomnia symptoms had an indirect association through PTSD and depressive symptoms, and thwarted belongingness. The model with insomnia, PTSD, and depressive symptoms, and perceived burdensomeness accounted for 35% of the variance in risk. Insomnia symptoms had an indirect association through PTSD and depressive symptoms, and perceived burdensomeness.; Limitations: Data are cross-sectional, precluding the testing of causal associations.; Conclusions: In veterans, insomnia symptoms may be associated with increased PTSD and depressive symptoms, which may be associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior directly and indirectly through relationship disruptions.; Copyright Â© 2018.

164,Assessment and treatment of insomnia in adult patients with alcohol use disorders,"Insomnia in patients with alcohol dependence has increasingly become a target of treatment due to its prevalence, persistence, and associations with relapse and suicidal thoughts, as well as randomized controlled studies demonstrating efficacy with behavior therapies and non-addictive medications. This article focuses on assessing and treating insomnia that persists despite 4 or more weeks of sobriety in alcohol-dependent adults. Selecting among the various options for treatment follows a comprehensive assessment of insomnia and its multifactorial causes. In addition to chronic, heavy alcohol consumption and its effects on sleep regulatory systems, contributing factors include premorbid insomnia; co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and other sleep disorders; use of other substances and medications; stress; environmental factors; and inadequate sleep hygiene. The assessment makes use of history, rating scales, and sleep diaries as well as physical, mental status, and laboratory examinations to rule out these factors. Polysomnography is indicated when another sleep disorder is suspected, such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder, or when insomnia is resistant to treatment. Sobriety remains a necessary, first-line treatment for insomnia, and most patients will have some improvement. If insomnia-specific treatment is needed, then brief behavioral therapies are the treatment of choice, because they have shown long-lasting benefit without worsening of drinking outcomes. Medications work faster, but they generally work only as long as they are taken. Melatonin agonists; sedating antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics; and benzodiazepine receptor agonists each have their benefits and risks, which must be weighed and monitored to optimize outcomes. Some relapse prevention medications may also have sleep-promoting activity. Although it is assumed that treatment for insomnia will help prevent relapse, this has not been firmly established. Therefore, insomnia and alcohol dependence might be best thought of as co-occurring disorders, each of which requires its own treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

165,"Prescription sleeping pills, insomnia, and suicidality in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication","Background: Sedative-hypnotics have been associated with suicide attempts and completed suicides in a number of toxicologic, epidemiologic, and clinical studies. Most studies, however, inadequately address confounding by insomnia, which not only is a component of many mental health disorders that increase suicidal risk, but also is independently associated with suicidality. Moreover, the association of nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (NBRAs) with suicidality has not been specifically studied in the US general population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the independent contribution of prescription sedative-hypnotic use, particularly the NBRAs, to suicidal ideas, plans, and suicide attempts in the general US population, after adjusting for insomnia and other confounding variables. Method: Secondary analyses of National Comorbidity Survey Replication data for 5,692 household respondents interviewed between 2001 and 2003 assessed the cross-sectional relationships between prescription sedative-hypnotic use and suicidality in the previous 12 months. Multivariate, hierarchical logistic regression analyses controlled for symptoms of insomnia, past-year mental disorders, lifetime chronic physical illnesses, and demographic variables. Results: Prescription sedative-hypnotic use in the past year was significantly associated with suicidal thoughts (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.2; P < .001), suicide plans (AOR = 1.9; P < .01), and suicide attempts (AOR = 3.4; P < .01). It was a stronger predictor than insomnia for both suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts and significantly improved the fit of these regression models (suicidal thoughts, P < .01; suicide attempts, P < .05). Conclusions: Prescription sleeping pills, as exemplified by zolpidem and zaleplon, are associated with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts during the past 12 months, but no evidence of causality was provided by this study. Clinical practitioners should recognize that patients taking similar types of sedative-hypnotics have a marker of increased risk for suicidality.

166,Increased orexin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid the first year after a suicide attempt,"Background: The orexins (hypocretins) and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) are hypothalamic peptides involved in the regulation of sleep and appetite. We have previously shown that levels of both orexin-A and CART in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are related to specific psychiatric symptoms. Methods: Ten patients took part in lumbar punctures and psychiatric evaluations in conjunction to a suicide attempt and after 6 and 12 months. We measured CSF-orexin and CART using radioimmunoassays. Results: Mean CSF-orexin was significantly higher at the first and second follow-up than at the suicide attempt. In contrast, mean CSF-CART did not differ over time. Total SUAS scores, as well as ratings of CPRS item 66 (global illness) were significantly lower at follow-up. At one year, there was a significant negative correlation between the change in CSF-orexin and the change in total SUAS score. Limitations: The number of patients who participated was relatively small. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that orexin is involved in psychiatric symptomatology.

167,Differential improvement in depressive symptoms for tDCS alone and combined with pharmacotherapy: an exploratory analysis from The Sertraline Vs Electrical Current Therapy For Treating Depression Clinical Study,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising therapy for major depression treatment, although little is known of its effects in ameliorating distinct symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important, not only to increase knowledge of its antidepressant mechanisms, but also to guide its potential use in clinical practice. Using data from a recent factorial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial applying tDCS-alone and combined with sertraline to treat 120 depressed outpatients over 6wk (Brunoni et al., 2013), we investigated the pattern of improvement in symptoms of depression from the Montgomery-Asberg depression scale (MADRS). First, we performed one multivariate analysis of variance with the score improvement of the 10 MADRS items as dependent variables. Significant (p < 0.05) results were further explored with follow-up analyses of variance. TDCS (alone and combined with sertraline) improved concentration difficulties and pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. The combined treatment also improved apparent and reported sadness, lassitude and inability to feel. Indeed, tDCS/sertraline significantly ameliorated all but the â€˜vegetativeâ€™ depression symptoms (inner tension, sleep and appetite items). We further discuss whether bifrontal tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could be associated with improvement in cognitive (concentration) and affective (pessimistic/suicidal thoughts) processing, while the combined treatment might have a more widespread antidepressant effect by simultaneously acting on different depression pathways. We also identified patterns of antidepressant improvement for tDCS that might aid in tailoring specific interventions for different subtypes of depressed patients, e.g. particularly those with suicidal ideation.

168,Mortality rate after open Roux-in-Y gastric bypass: a 10-year follow-up,"The prevalence of obesity has increased to epidemic status worldwide. Thousands of morbidly obese individuals undergo bariatric surgery for sustained weight loss; however, mid- and long-term outcomes of this surgery are still uncertain. Our objective was to estimate the 10-year mortality rate, and determine risk factors associated with death in young morbidly obese adults who underwent bariatric surgery. All patients who underwent open Roux-in-Y gastric bypass surgery between 2001 and 2010, covered by an insurance company, were analyzed to determine possible associations between risk factors present at the time of surgery and deaths related and unrelated to the surgery. Among the 4344 patients included in the study, 79% were female with a median age of 34.9 years and median body mass index (BMI) of 42 kg/m(2). The 30-day and 10-year mortality rates were 0.55 and 3.34%, respectively, and 53.7% of deaths were related to early or late complications following bariatric surgery. Among these, 42.7% of the deaths were due to sepsis and 24.3% to cardiovascular complications. Male gender, age â‰¥50 years, BMI â‰¥50 kg/m(2), and hypertension significantly increased the hazard for all deaths (P<0.001). Age â‰¥50 years, BMI â‰¥50 kg/m(2), and surgeon inexperience elevated the hazard of death from causes related to surgery. Male gender and age â‰¥50 years were the factors associated with increased mortality from death not related to surgery. The overall risk of death after bariatric surgery was quite low, and half of the deaths were related to the surgery. Older patients and superobese patients were at greater risk of surgery-related deaths, as were patients operated on by less experienced surgeons.;Gastric Bypass/*mortality, Obesity, Morbid/*surgery, Postoperative Complications/*mortality, Adult, Age Factors, Body Mass Index, Brazil/epidemiology, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Male, Middle Aged, Mortality, Obesity, Morbid/epidemiology, Professional Competence, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, Sepsis/mortality, Sex Factors, Statistics, Nonparametric, Suicide/statistics & numerical data, Survival Rate, Thromboembolism/mortality, Treatment Outcome","Bruschi Kelles, S M; Diniz, M F H S; Machado, C J & Barreto, S M",0,168
169,"Moral injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal behavior among National Guard personnel","Objective: To empirically examine similarities and differences in the signs and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral injury and to determine if the combination of these 2 constructs is associated with increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample of U.S. National Guard personnel. Method: 930 National Guard personnel from the states of Utah and Idaho completed an anonymous online survey. Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was used to test a measurement model of PTSD and moral injury. A structural model was next constructed to test the interactive effects of PTSD and moral injury on history of suicide ideation and attempts. Results: Results of the ESEM confirmed that PTSD and moral injury were distinct constructs characterized by unique symptoms, although depressed mood loaded onto both PTSD and moral injury. The interaction of PTSD and moral injury was associated with significantly increased risk for suicide ideation and attempts. A sensitivity analysis indicated the interaction remained a statistically significant predictor of suicide attempt even among the subgroup of participants with a history of suicide ideation. Conclusion: PTSD and moral injury represent separate constructs with unique signs and symptoms. The combination of PTSD and moral injury confers increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and differentiates between military personnel who have attempted suicide and those who have only thought about suicide.

Setting: Outpatient TBI clinic on a US military base in Iraq. Participants: Military personnel (N = 158) referred to an outpatient TBI clinic for a standardized intake evaluation, 135 (85.4%) who had a diagnosis of mTBI and 23 (14.6%) who did not meet criteria for TBI. Main Measures: Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, Depression subscale of the Behavioral Health Measure-20, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military Version, Insomnia Severity Index, self-report questionnaire, and clinical interview addressing TBI-related symptoms. Results: Among patients with mTBI, increased suicidality was significantly associated with depression and the interaction of depression with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Longer duration of loss of consciousness was associated with decreased likelihood for any suicidality. Conclusion: Assessment after TBI in a combat zone may assist providers in identifying those at risk for suicidality and making treatment recommendations for service members with mTBI.

171,Depression mediates the relation of insomnia severity with suicide risk in three clinical samples of US Military personnel,"Background: A growing body of empirical research suggests insomnia severity is directly related to suicide ideation, attempts, and death in nonmilitary samples, even when controlling for depression and other suicide risk factors. Few studies have explored this relationship in U.S. military personnel. Methods: The present study entailed secondary data analyses examining the associations of insomnia severity with suicide ideation and attempts in three clinical samples: Air Force psychiatric outpatients (n = 158), recently discharged Army psychiatric inpatients (n = 168), and Army psychiatric outpatients (n = 54). Participants completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, the Beck Depression Inventoryâ€II or Patient Health Questionnaireâ€9, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist at baseline; two samples also completed these measures during followâ€up. Results: Sleep disturbance was associated with concurrent (Î²â€™s > 0.21; Pâ€™s < 0.059) and prospective (Î²â€™s > 0.39; Pâ€™s < 0.001) suicide ideation in all three samples. When adjusting for age, gender, depression, and posttraumatic stress, insomnia severity was no longer directly associated with suicide ideation either concurrently (Î²â€™s < 0.19; Pâ€™s > 0.200) or prospectively (Î²â€™s < 0.26; Pâ€™s > 0.063), but depression was (Î²â€™s > 0.22; Pâ€™s < 0.012). Results of a latent difference score mediation model indicated that depression mediated the relation of insomnia severity with suicide ideation. Conclusions: Across three clinical samples of military personnel, depression explained the relationship between insomnia severity and suicide risk.

172,Challenges and considerations for managing suicide risk in combat zones,"As suicide rates in the military rise, increased attention has been placed on the effective management of high-risk service members. Military mental health professionals deployed to combat zones face a number of challenges and barriers for effective risk management that are unique to the deployed setting. To date, there exists no body of literature identifying areas in which suicide risk management differs between garrison and combat settings to guide mental health professionals in improving clinical decision making with respect to managing suicidal service members in combat zones. On the basis of experience gained during deployments to combat zones, the authors outline several key features of the deployed context that can impact suicide risk and its effective management in combat zones and integrate empirical findings relevant to each issue.

Sleep and behaviour questionnaires were completed by 205 people (aged 21-83 yrs) living in health- or social-services-managed community housing. The informants were carers and the individuals themselves where possible. 79 people with sleep problems were compared with 121 individuals without this difficulty; 5 people were excluded from the analysis. Individuals with sleep problems displayed significantly more daytime irritability, stereotypy and hyperactivity than those without sleep problems. Individuals displaying clinically significant aggression/temper, self-injury and screaming were significantly more likely to have a concurrent sleep problem, and these forms of challenging behaviour were significantly more severe in the sleep problem group. Associations between sleep problems and daytime challenging behaviour exist in this population, although the nature of any links remains unclear and should be the attention of future research.

174,"Factors affecting the presence of depression, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation in patients attending primary health care service in Lithuania","Objective: The aim of this study was to establish prevalence, recognition, and risk factors for mental disorders and suicidal ideation in PC patients. Design: A cross-sectional survey based on standard mental health evaluation. Setting: Lithuanian primary care. Subjects: 998 patients from four urban PC clinics. Main outcome measures: Current mental disorders and suicidal ideation assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: According to the MINI, 27% of patients were diagnosed with at least one current mental disorder. The most common mental disorders were generalized anxiety disorder (18%) and major depressive episode (MDE) (15%), followed by social phobia (3%), panic disorder (3%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (2%). Some 6% of patients reported suicidal ideation. About 70% of patients with current mental disorder had no documented psychiatric diagnosis and about 60% received no psychiatric treatment. Greater adjusted odds for current MDE were associated with being widowed or divorced patients (odds ratio, OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8) and with lower education (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3), while greater adjusted odds for any current anxiety disorder were found for women (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.8) and for patients with documented insomnia (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.2). Suicidal ideation was independently associated with use of antidepressants (OR = 5.4, 95% CI 1.7-16.9), with current MDE (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.8), and with excessive alcohol consumption (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.8). Conclusions: Depression, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation are prevalent but poorly recognized among PC patients. The presence of current MDE is independently associated with marital status and with lower education, while current anxiety disorder is associated with female gender and insomnia. Suicidal ideation is associated with current MDE, and with antidepressants and alcohol use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

The use of combinations of markers to improve accuracy and the use of markers during periods of good health are discussed. A literature review suggests some promising candidates as markers of affective illness, including the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, -3H-H-imipramine platelet binding, REM induction using M-1 muscarinic agonist, and melatonin. A strategy using gene mapping techniques as a method of detecting additional markers is also presented.

176,Impact of Non-Suicidal Self-injury Scale: Initial psychometric validation,"The current study examined the psychometric properties of the impact of non-suicidal self-injury scale (INS), a scale developed to assess the social, behavioral, and emotional consequences of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). University students (N=128) who endorsed a history of NSSI were administered the INS, as well as measures of hypothesized convergent and divergent validity. Results suggested that the INS is best conceptualized as a one-factor scale, and internal consistency analyses indicated excellent reliability. The INS was significantly correlated with well-known measures of NSSI severity (i.e., NSSI frequency, NSSI recency), and measures of suicide attempt history and emotional reactivity. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the INS contributed unique variance to the prediction of physical disfigurement (i.e., NSSI scarring) and clinically significant social anxiety, even after taking into account NSSI frequency. Furthermore, the INS demonstrated divergent validity. Implications for research on NSSI disorder and clinical practice are discussed.

177,An organisational response to an increase in suicides: A case study,"Purpose: This paper seeks to describe the development of a real time suicide alert system and to identify how, as a result, organisations were able to respond in a timely way to an increasing trend in suicides within the County Durham and Darlington area. Design/methodology/approach: Between October 2008 and August 2009 an unprecedented concentration of suicides occurred in County Durham, North East England. As a result, an independent review of these deaths was conducted in 2009/2010. Recommendations from the review were implemented and included the development of a real time suicide alert system. Findings: Following implementation of the real time suicide alert system in autumn 2010 a further significant concentration of cases was immediately identified. A total of 24 deaths were identified between September and December 2010. There was a wide geographical spread across County Durham and Darlington. The case profiles revealed a number of risk factors including recent bereavement, relationship difficulties and financial problems. In addition sleeplessness, low mood and problems associated with housing were also identified. Men under the age of 50 years accounted for over 63 per cent of the cases. An organisational response in County Durham and Darlington was triggered by the information provided via the real time alert. The response was framed by the case profiles, evidence from the literature and lessons learned from other areas in the UK that had also experienced an escalation of suicide cases. In January 2011 there were no further potential suicides in County Durham and Darlington and the three-month rolling average number of suicides returned to below expected limits, and this remains the case as of December 2011. No direct correlation between the work of the response team across County Durham and Darlington and rate of suicides resuming within normal limits can be claimed, indeed many of the initiatives are still being evaluated but the organisation now has much better control over the ability to respond, characterised by timely evidence based interventions and improved partnership working. Practical implications: The development of a local real time suicide alert system can reduce the delay in the reporting of potential suicides and can identify trends; it can also provide the basis for a timely organisational response. Originality/value: This paper describes an innovative multiagency approach to the problem of delay in the notification of suicides. This will be of interest to commissioners and providers who may want to develop similar systems so that they can immediately identify an escalation of deaths due to suicide and respond in timely manner.

178,Improving house physicians' assessments of self-poisoning,"Designed and tested a questionnaire for use by house physicians (HPs) in assessing patients who take overdoses. 150 patients admitted after self-poisoning were interviewed by 12 HPs who used the questionnaire and 12 HPs who asked questions they felt appropriate. A research assistant (RA) then interviewed the Ss and compared the 2 assessments. There was greater agreement between the RA and the HPs who used the questionnaire than those who interviewed Ss in an unstructured way. The latter group of HPs often failed to elicit basic information about mood, sleep, and alcohol consumption. A sample questionnaire is appended.

179,Behavioral screening measures delivered with a smartphone app: Psychometric properties and user preference,"The smartphone is an increasingly widespread technological vehicle for general health and psychological health promotion, evaluation, education, and sometimes intervention. However, the psychometric performance of behavioral health screening measures has not been commonly evaluated for the new, small-format, touch-screen medium. Before mobile-based applications for behavioral health screening can be disseminated confidently, the reliability and the validity of measures administered by the smartphone must be evaluated. We compared psychometric properties (i.e., internal consistency and test-retest reliability) of seven behavioral health measures completed on paper, a computer, and an iPhone by 45 army soldiers. The results showed the internal consistencies of the smartphone-delivered measures to be equivalent and very high across all three modalities and the test-retest reliability of the iPhone measures also to be very high. Furthermore, completion of the behavioral screening measures by the iPhone was highly preferred over the other modalities and was reported to be easy and convenient. Our findings help corroborate the use of smartphones and other small mobile devices for behavioral health screening. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

180,Suicide related events and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder treatments in children and adolescents: a meta-analysis of atomoxetine and methylphenidate comparator clinical trials,"Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is becoming an increasingly commonly diagnosed and treated childhood illness. Untreated ADHD is recognised as an independent risk factor for suicide-related events and deliberate self-harm and is reported more commonly in these populations. With the treatment of ADHD it is thus crucial to understand further any associations between pharmacological treatments and suicide-related events. Specific data for suicide-related events with stimulants have not been publically reported. Suicidal tendencies are, however, a contraindication to the treatment of patients with methylphenidate. Clinicians and patients may be helped by a meta-analytic comparison of suicide-related events in comparative randomised double-blind atomoxetine and methylphenidate clinical trials.; Methods: Suicide-related events retrospectively mapped to the suicide-related event assessment instrument recommended by the FDA, the Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), were evaluated in five double-blind placebo controlled comparative studies of atomoxetine and methylphenidate (nâ€‰=â€‰1024) of 6 to 9Â weeks duration. The Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio and Mantel-Haenszel incidence differences have been calculated.; Results: In total there were 5 suicide-related events, atomoxetine (ATX) 3/559 and methylphenidate (MPH) 2/465. There were no suicide attempts nor completed suicides. Meta-analysis finds no difference of a difference in risk between ATX and MPH with a Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio of 0.52 (95% CI; 0.06, 4.54).; Conclusion: In the only reported meta-analysis of comparative suicide-related events between atomoxetine and methylphenidate, no significant evidence of a difference in risk has been found. These data may be informative to clinicians and patients when developing clinical guidelines.; ADHD, Atomoxetine, Methylphenidate, Suicide-related events, Summary of product characteristics, Systematic review","Bushe, Chris J. & Savill, Nicola C.",0,180
181,A pilot study of actigraphy as an objective measure of SSRI activation symptoms: Results from a randomized placebo controlled psychopharmacological treatment study,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are an efficacious and effective treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but have received scrutiny due to a potential side effect constellation called activation syndrome. While recent research introduced a subjective measure of activation syndrome, objective measures have not been tested. This pilot study, using data from a larger randomized-controlled trial, investigated the potential of actigraphy to provide an objective measure of activation symptoms in 44 youths with OCD beginning an SSRI medication regimen. Data were collected over the first four weeks of a multi-site, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled psychopharmacological treatment study and statistical modeling was utilized to test how activation syndrome severity predicts daily and nightly activity levels. Results indicated that youths with higher activation symptoms had lower daytime activity levels when treatment averages were analyzed; in contrast youths who experienced onset of activation symptoms one week were more likely to have higher day-time and night-time activity ratings that week. Results support actigraphy as a potential objective measure of activation symptoms. Subsequent studies are needed to confirm these findings and test clinical applications for use by clinicians to monitor activation syndrome during SSRI treatment.

182,Late-life depression: how to make a difficult diagnosis,"Approximately 15% of persons age 65 and older have major depression. Risk factors include a recent loss (eg, widowhood or mastectomy), living alone, co-morbidities (eg, hypertension, stroke, cognitive deficits), and drug interactions. Warning signs of depression may include weight loss, sleep problems, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, loss of interest in sexual relations, or changes in activities of daily living. The diagnosis of depression is easy to miss if the physician doesn't look for it, because older persons often don't mention feeling depressed. Yet undetected depression can be deadly for older patients, who have the highest rate of suicide among all Americans. Plans for suicide may be direct or covert, as in not eating or not taking heart medication.;Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Age Distribution, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Depressive Disorder/etiology, Diagnosis, Differential, Family Practice, Female, Humans, Incidence, Male, Managed Care Programs, Referral and Consultation, Risk Factors","Butler, R N; Cohen, G; Lewis, M I; Simmons-Clemmons, W & Sunderland, T",0,182

Some chapters give an excellent overview of the area and of recent developments, present clear guidelines on assessment and treatment, and then outline future challenges--most notably, the chapters on cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), insomnia, bereavement, suicide, and continuing psychosocial intervention as a function of memory clinics. Inevitably there is some repetition and overlap between chapters and unfortunately some authors do tend to focus on their own work rather than give an overview of the particular area. These chapters would benefit from expansion to include such an overview and the range of interventions and different modalities of interventions available. Possible shortcomings are that, for a handbook, it was not as comprehensive as it could have been and that some of the repetition and overlap could have been avoided.

184,The complex spectrum of forensic issues arising from obesity,"The increasing numbers of obese and morbidly obese individuals in the community are having a direct effect on forensic facilities. In addition to having to install more robust equipment for handling large bodies, the quality of autopsy examinations may be reduced by the physical difficulties that arise in trying to position bodies correctly so that normal examinations can proceed. Accelerated putrefaction is often an added complication. Metabolic disturbances resulting from obesity increase susceptibility to a range of conditions that are associated with sudden and unexpected death, and surgery may have increased complications. The rates of a number of different malignancies, including lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma and multiple myeloma, and carcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, gallbladder, thyroid, prostate, breast and endometrium, are increased. In addition, obese individuals have higher rates of diabetes mellitus, and sepsis. The unexpected collapse of an obese individual should raise the possibility of a wide range of conditions, many of which may be more difficult to demonstrate at autopsy than in an individual with a normal body mass index. Although sudden cardiac death due to cardiomegaly, pulmonary thromboembolism, or ischemic heart disease may be the most probable diagnosis in an unexpected collapse, the range of possible underlying conditions is extensive and often only determinable after full postmortem examination.;Obesity/*complications, Autopsy, Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology, Diabetes Mellitus/etiology, Digestive System Diseases/etiology, Female, Forensic Pathology, Humans, Hyperlipidemias/etiology, Infection/etiology, Length of Stay, Metabolic Syndrome X/etiology, Mortuary Practice, Neoplasms/etiology, Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome/etiology, Phytotherapy/adverse effects, Postmortem Changes, Postoperative Complications/etiology, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications/etiology, Pressure Ulcer/etiology, Renal Dialysis/mortality, Resuscitation/adverse effects, Skin Diseases/etiology, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/etiology, Specimen Handling, Suicide, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Tracheostomy/adverse effects, Wounds and Injuries/etiology","Byard, Roger W",0,184
185,The psychological symptoms of conjugal bereavement in elderly men over the first 13 months,"Investigated the psychological symptoms experienced by recently widowed older men. It was hypothesized that conjugal bereavement in this group would be characterized by a mixture of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. 57 widowers and 57 married men (all aged 65+ yrs) in Australia were interviewed. Widowers were interviewed approximately 6 mo and 13 mo postbereavement. Instruments included the Self-rating Depression Scale, the State test of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the General Health Questionnaire. Widowers reported more state anxiety and general psychological distress, but not more depression or loneliness, than matched married men over the 1st 13 mo of bereavement. Widowers also reported more sleep disturbance and thoughts of death and suicide than married men. Level of state anxiety was strongly correlated with intensity of grief.

186,The cultural context of loneliness: Risk factors in active duty soldiers,"Loneliness has been shown to predict mental health problems and suicide in active duty soldiers. In the present study, we examined distal (e.g., demographic & socioeconomic characteristics) to proximal factors (e.g., platoon relations, relationship quality) that were associated with loneliness in active duty soldiers in the U.S. Army. Results revealed a set of factors that were associated with loneliness in active duty soldiers, including age, frequency of contact with friends and family by phone, childhood trauma, self-reported overall emotional health, intra-platoon harassment, perceived stress, perceived platoon cohesion and support, organizational citizenship behavior, relationship satisfaction with friends, and relationship satisfaction with platoon members. The association between loneliness and both perceived stress and relationship satisfaction with platoon members reached a moderate effect size in the multivariate models. Although some of predictors overlap with those identified in studies of civilians, most were unique to soldiers. Implications are discussed for understanding loneliness in an organization like the military and for the early identification of and intervention with active duty soldiers who may be at risk for mental and behavioral problems.

187,Psychological aspects of traumatic injury in children and adolescents,"Each year millions of children are exposed to some form of extreme traumatic stressor. These traumatic events include natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, floods, hurricanes), motor vehicle accidents, life-threatening illnesses and associated painful medical procedures (e.g., severe burns, cancer, limb amputations), physical abuse, sexual assault, witnessing domestic or community violence, kidnapping, and sudden death of a parent. During times of war, violent and nonviolent trauma (e.g., lack of fuel and food) may have terrible effects on children's adjustment. The events of September 11, 2001 and the unceasing suicidal attacks in the Middle East underscore the importance of understanding how children and adolescents react to disasters and terrorism. The body of literature related to children and their responses to disasters and trauma is growing. Mental health professionals are increasing their understanding about what factors are associated with increased risk (vulnerability) and affect how children cope with traumatic events. Researchers recognize that children's responses to major stress are similar to adults' (reexperiencing the event, avoidance, and arousal) and that these responses are not transient. A review of the literature indicates that PTSD is the most common psychiatric disorder after traumatic experiences, including physical injuries. There is also evidence for other comorbid conditions, including mood, anxiety, sleep, conduct, learning, and attention problems. In terms of providing treatment, CBT emerges as the best validated therapeutic approach for children and adolescents who experienced trauma-related symptoms, particularly symptoms associated with anxiety or mood disorders. The best approach to the injured child requires injury and pain assessment followed by specific interventions, such as pain management, brief consultation, and crisis intervention immediately after the specific traumatic event. Family support also may be necessary to help the family through this difficult period. The main conclusion that arises from the research on resilience in development is that extraordinary resilience and recovery power of children depend on basic human protective systems operating in their favor. This finding has produced a fundamental change in the framework for understanding and helping children at high risk or already in trouble. This shift is evident in a changing conceptualization of the goals of prevention and intervention that currently address competence and problems. Strategies for fostering resilience described in this article should be tested in future controlled psychotherapy trials to verify their efficacy on children's protective factors.;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*etiology, Stress, Psychological/*etiology, Wounds and Injuries/*psychology, Adolescent, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/complications, Burns, Child, Child Abuse/psychology, Child Abuse/rehabilitation, Disasters, Family/psychology, Humans, Impulsive Behavior/complications, Neoplasms/complications, Pain Management, Prognosis, Rape/psychology, Risk Factors, Sex Offenses/psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diagnosis, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/therapy, Stress, Psychological/epidemiology, Substance-Related Disorders/complications, Suicide/psychology, Violence/psychology, Warfare","Caffo, Ernesto & Belaise, Carlotta",0,187
188,A preliminary benefit-risk assessment of varenicline in smoking cessation,"Varenicline is a recently developed medication for smoking cessation, which has been available on prescription since 2006. It is a selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, and is designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms and to lessen the rewards of continued smoking. Our objective in this article is to assess the efficacy of varenicline as an aid to smoking cessation and to weigh the potential benefits against the possible risks. We identified ten randomized controlled trials and one cohort study with historical controls. In total there were 7999 participants, 5112 of whom received varenicline. Eight of the trials compared varenicline with placebo for cessation, two compared it with nicotine replacement therapy and one tested extended use for relapse prevention. Three of the varenicline/placebo trials also included a bupropion arm. The recommended dosage of varenicline 1 mg twice daily more than doubled the chances of quitting at 6 months or longer, with a relative risk (RR) compared with placebo of 2.38 (95% CI 2.00, 2.84). It also outperformed bupropion (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.22, 1.88]) and nicotine replacement (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.01, 1.71]). A reduced dosage regimen of 1 mg daily also increased cessation (RR 1.88 [95% CI 1.35, 2.60]). In the trials, varenicline significantly reduced craving and other withdrawal symptoms. The most frequent adverse event was nausea, occurring in 30-40% of varenicline users. However, this was generally reported at mild to moderate levels, diminished over time and was associated with attributable discontinuation rates of between 0.6% and 7.6%. Other commonly occurring adverse events included insomnia, abnormal dreams and headache. Serious adverse events were rare, with no treatment-related deaths during the treatment or follow-up phases. Postmarketing surveillance has raised new questions about the safety of varenicline. In February 2008, the US FDA issued a public health advisory note, reporting a possible association between varenicline and an increased risk of behaviour change, agitation, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. They have required the manufacturers to revise the labelling of varenicline and the Summary of Product Characteristics, and to issue a medication guide. It is arguable that much of the reported behavioural and mood changes may be associated with nicotine withdrawal, although some effects occurred in people who continued to smoke while taking the medication. In view of the potential, if unproven, risk that varenicline may be associated with serious neuropsychiatric adverse outcomes, patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline, and their families and caregivers, should be alerted about the need to monitor for neuropsychiatric symptoms, including changes in behaviour, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour, and to report such symptoms immediately to the patient's healthcare provider.;Smoking Cessation*/methods, Benzazepines/*adverse effects, Benzazepines/*therapeutic use, Quinoxalines/*adverse effects, Quinoxalines/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use, Benzazepines/pharmacology, Bupropion/therapeutic use, Humans, Nicotine/therapeutic use, Nicotinic Agonists/therapeutic use, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing, Quinoxalines/pharmacology, Recurrence, Risk Assessment, Smoking/psychology, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/prevention & control, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/psychology, Varenicline","Cahill, Kate; Stead, Lindsay & Lancaster, Tim",0,188

A study of children aged 16 or under was carried out, with all cases of child sexual abuse requiring investigation within 12 mo included. Data were collected on 144 children from police, social services, and pediatricians. Follow-up was by questionnaire and interview with involved professionals at 4 wks, 9 mo, and 2 yrs post investigation. Initially, two-thirds of children showed emotional or behavioral indicators of disturbance, commonly sleep disturbance, temper tantrums, and depression. Over time, there was a substantial increase, with anxiety and depression, suicide attempts, substance abuse, lack of interaction with peers, and sexualized behavior showing increases. Age, gender, abuse, and perpetrator characteristics did not show strong effects initially. Children involved in criminal proceedings were at particular risk. In the absence of clear risk factors other than initial disturbance, process models involving cognitive factors may be helpful in explaining disturbance, and the need for early identification of disturbance and intervention is highlighted.

190,Suicidal ideation in patients with fibromyalgia: A crosssectional study,"Chronic pain, sleep disturbances, and depression, which are relevant symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome, have been demonstrated to be associated with an increased likelihood of suicidal behaviors. Mortality from suicide has been shown to be greater among patients with fibromyalgia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of suicidal ideation among a sample of patients with fibromyalgia and to evaluate its relationship with the clinical symptomatology of fibromyalgia. Baseline data from fibromyalgia patients willing to participate in different clinical studies were collected. Outcome measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the SFâ€12 Health Survey. The scores for these scales were compared between patients with and without suicidal ideation. The presence of suicidal ideation was assessed using the answer provided to item 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory. The results were adjusted by age, sex, total comorbidity, and time since diagnosis with multiple linear regression. The sample comprised 373 patients of whom one hundred and seventyâ€nine (48%) reported suicidal ideation: 148 (39.7%) reported passive suicidal ideation and 31 (8.3%) active suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was markedly associated with depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and global mental health, whereas only weak relationships were observed between suicidal ideation and both pain and general physical health.

191,Suicide attempts and risk of suicide in patients with fibromyalgia: a survey in Spanish patients,"Objectives: Depression, chronic pain and sleep disturbances frequently co-exist in FM and have shown to be independently related with suicidal behaviours. The present survey was performed to evaluate the prevalence of previous suicide attempts in patients with FM and its potential relationship with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the disease.; Methods: A concise survey was sent to patients of seven associations of patients with FM. In addition to the inquiry concerning the number, if any, and characteristics of suicide attempts, the survey included questions about sociodemographic and clinical data of patients as well as the revised FM impact questionnaire (FIQR) and the Plutchik suicide risk scale.; Results: One hundred and eighty patients answered the survey. Thirty (16.7%) of them reported one to three previous suicide attempts. Drug poisoning was the most frequently employed method for suicide attempt (70%). No relevant differences were found between suicide attempters and non-attempters in relation to age, education and marital status, but a significant difference was found in relation to employment status. Plutchik's scale scores, both in suicide attempters and non-attempters, were higher than those found in the literature. FIQR scores were significantly higher in suicide attempters than in non-attempters. A high-positive correlation was found between FIQR and Plutchik suicide risk scale scores. Pain, poor sleep quality, anxiety and depression were positively correlated with suicide risk.; Conclusions: FM is associated with an increased risk of suicide and suicide attempts.

192,Montelukast-induced adverse drug reactions: a review of case reports in the literature,"Background: Montelukast, a leucotriene receptor antagonist, binds the cysteinyl leucotriene type 1 receptor. Montelukast is commonly prescribed to asthma patients as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids. Several clinical trials emphasized that montelukast can be considered a safe drug. However, recent evidence reconsidered the benefit/risk ratio of the use of montelukast for both paediatric and adult patients.; Summary: The present review analyzed the previous published case reports regarding montelukast-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs). They included agitation, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, hallucinations, suicidal thinking and suicidality, tremor, dizziness, drowsiness, neuropathies and seizures. The immune system can be involved, in particular, cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome have been published. Furthermore, it can induce hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and eosinophilic infiltration. In addition, hepatobiliary, pancreatic and uropoietic disorders have been observed. Some of these cases are characterized by severe prognosis (i.e. neurological deficit and fatal hepatotoxicity). Key Message: The use of montelukast can be burdened by several ADRs, of which physicians should be aware in their clinical practice. A better understanding of the mechanisms causing ADRs after using montelukast could help researchers and clinicians in defining a risk-reduction strategy aimed to lessen montelukast toxicity. More accurate epidemiological studies, in order to discover risk factors favouring montelukast-associated ADRs, are demanded.; Â© 2014 S.

193,Association between lifetime headache and history of suicide attempts in the elderly,"Background: Pain-related conditions have been reported to play a key role among risk factors for suicide. Headache in particular has been repeatedly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The aims of this study were: 1) to assess the association between lifetime headache (both non-migrainous headache and migraine) and lifetime suicide attempts (SA); 2) to differentiate, within subjects with lifetime SA, patients with and without lifetime headache in terms of socio-demographic and clinical features. Methods: We studied 1965 subjects from a cohort of community-dwelling persons aged 65 years and over without dementia (the ESPRIT study), divided in two groups: those with (n =75), and those without a lifetime SA (n =1890). Logistic regression analyses were used to compare these groups according to lifetime headache status. Results: After adjusting for gender, living alone, tobacco and alcohol consumption, and depressive, manic/hypomanic and anxiety disorders, lifetime headache frequency was significantly higher in subjects with a lifetime SA compared with controls (OR=1.92 [1.17â€“3.15]). Additionally, different factors were identified as being associated with lifetime SA in participants with lifetime headache (female gender, a lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insomnia, lifetime major depression) versus participants without headache (glycemia and lifetime major depression). Conclusions: Lifetime headache was associated with lifetime SA.

194,Acute onset of xanthopsia associated with risperidone,"Presents the case report of a Patient X, a 28-year-old woman, was admitted to our clinic with complaints of anhedonia, sadness, decreased appetite and sleep, loss of sexual desire and energy, irritability, suicidal thoughts, and apathy. She stated that she had been experiencing these symptoms for 3 months. Mild color blindness was found when patient X was tested with Ishihara pseudoisochromatic charts, and minimal macular pigment epithelium changes were found in the fundus examination. We considered that the xanthopsia was probably associated with the risperidone so we stopped the risperidone but continued venlafaxine and asked the patient to check in periodically. This article describes these and other ocular adverse effects that may be encountered when examining patients who are taking antipsychotic drugs. Judging from this case, risperidone may be associated with ocular adverse effects because of its antagonistic properties on the dopamine receptors, so awareness of the adverse effects of risperidone implies an ophthalmologic follow-up.

195,Restless Leg Syndrome associated with aripiprazole,"Presents the case report of a 55-year-old female who presented to our outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV. Patient who has been receiving venlafaxine and quetiapine with doses of 75 mg/day and 300 mg/day respectively one year, was not being followed-up regularly. The patient had complaints such as suicidal thoughts and insomnia since the onset and gained 10 kg during the treatment. She was using ramipril 5 mg/day and her blood pressure follow-ups were normal. The venlafaxine dose of the patient was elevated to 150 mg/day and dose of quetiapine was remained same at 300 mg/day. Aripiprazol with a dose of 5 mg/day was added to the treatment of the patient due to complaints on the follow-up after a month. In literature, a case of RLS related with the combination of venlafaxine and quetiapine was reported3. RLS symptoms were remitted when aripiprazole was added to treatment4,5. The inflammation of the RLS by D2 receptor antagonists and well response of the symptoms to dopaminergic drugs such as levodopa, suggest that the dopaminergic system acts as central role1. Both improvement and causation of the RLS symptoms by aripiprazole can be explained by the partial agonistic effect on D2 receptors.

196,Prevalence and correlates of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in people prescribed pharmaceutical opioids for chronic pain,"Objectives: The main objectives of the paper were (1) to examine the prevalence of suicidality in a large community-based chronic pain sample taking prescribed opioids for chronic pain; and (2) to examine general and pain-specific factors that predict such ideation, and the transition from ideation to making a suicide attempt (ideation-to-action). Materials and Methods: Baseline data from the Pain and Opioids IN Treatment (POINT) study with a cohort of 1514 community-based people prescribed opioids for chronic noncancer pain across Australia. Results: Past 12-month suicidal ideation was reported by 36.5% of the cohort and 16.4% had made a lifetime suicide attempt (2.5% in the last 12 mo), after the onset of their pain condition. Suicidal ideation in the past 12 months was independently associated with a past suicide attempt [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.82; 95% confidence interval, 2.43-9.56] and past 12-month depression (AOR = 4.07, 95% confidence interval, 1.88-8.78). Only a lower pain self-efficacy score was independently associated with past 12- month ideation-to-action (AOR=0.98, 95%CI0.88-0.99). Notably, only general-suicide risk factors were associated with 12-month suicidal ideation; but for past year ideation-to-action, pain-specific factors also had independent associations. Discussion: The study is one of the first to comprehensively examine general and pain-specific risk factors for suicidality in a large chronic pain sample in which suicidal ideation was common. A low pain self-efficacy score was the only factor independently associated past 12-month ideation-to-action.

197,Safety and tolerability of atomoxetine in treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adult patients: An integrated analysis of 15 clinical trials,"The safety profile of atomoxetine in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has been studied in many clinical trials. We performed an integrated safety analysis of 15 clinical trials in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The analysis pooled patient data into three groups: acute placebo-controlled trials; long-term placebo-controlled trials; all trials. In total, 4829 adults (18-77 years, median: 36 years) were exposed to atomoxetine. Statistically significantly more atomoxetine-treated than placebo-treated patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (81.3% vs. 68.3% acute; 90.6% vs. 76.8% long term) and discontinued due to adverse events (8.9% vs. 4.0% acute; 17.9% vs. 6.3% long term). No statistically significant differences were observed in the proportion of patients experiencing serious adverse events. No previously unknown adverse events were identified. The most common adverse events included nausea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, insomnia and erectile dysfunction. Mean increases in heart rate (+5.2 beats per min) and blood pressure (systolic +2 mmHg, diastolic +1.9 mmHg) were modest. The proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate at any time was statistically significantly higher with atomoxetine (systolic blood pressure 13-17%, diastolic blood pressure 37-40%, heart rate 42-43%) compared to placebo (systolic blood pressure 8-13%, diastolic blood pressure 29-34%, heart rate 21-26%). There was no increased risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour. Our findings confirm atomoxetineâ€™s known safety profile. From a safety perspective, atomoxetine is a useful treatment option for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

199,Narcolepsy-cataplexy and psychosis: a case study,"Aims: To report a challenging patient a girl who developed narcolepsyy with cataplexy (NT1) and a psychosis during adolescence. To discuss diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of the comorbid cases.; Case Report: A 14-year-old girl was referred to Sleep and Epilepsy Unit for excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired nocturnal sleep, binge eating and weight gain, over the last year. After being diagnosed with a NT1 the patient was treated with modafinil and sodium oxybate. She was hospitalized for psychotic symptoms after starting NT1 treatment. Withdrawal of the narcolepsy treatment and initiation of haloperidol 1 mg/day (the only antipsychotic treatment she could tolerate) improved the delusions, hallucinations and dysphoria but worsened the narcolepsy symptoms. Polysomnography showed fragmented nocturnal sleep and five sleep REM onset periods in MSLT. Positive HLA-QB1*06:02 and undetectable level of hypocretine in the cerebrospinal fluid were found. MRI and CT-scan were normal. Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies Adapted for Narcolepsy (DIGSAN) questionnaire confirmed that patient presented a dual diagnostic NT1 and psychotic symptoms. The last sleep follow-up while on psychopharmacological treatment, showed an increased sleep efficiency index. She currently has severe somnolence, obesity, and partial cataplectic attacks along with normal mood, academic failure and social isolation.; Conclusion: The coexistence of narcolepsy with psychoses is a rare clinical entity, more frequent in adolescents than in adults.

200,"Risperidone use in children with Down syndrome, severe intellectual disability, and comorbid autistic spectrum disorders: A naturalistic study","Objective: We report on an open-label, naturalistic study using risperidone to treat disruptive behaviors and self-injury in children with Down syndrome, severe intellectual disability, and comorbid autism spectrum disorders (DS+ASDs). We hypothesized that hyperactivity and disruptive behaviors would improve in response to risperidone treatment consistent with previous studies of children with ASD. Methods: Subjects were children (mean age, 7.8 Â± 2.6 years), consisting of 20 males and three females identified through our outpatient Down Syndrome Clinic between 2000 and 2004. Results: Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist as the primary outcome measure, all five subscales showed significant improvement following risperidone treatment. The mean duration of treatment was 95.8 Â± 16.8 days, and mean total daily dose was 0.66 Â± 0.28 mg/day. The Hyperactivity, Stereotypy, and Lethargy subscale scores showed the most significant reduction (p < .001), followed by Irritability (p < .02), and Inappropriate Speech (p < .04). Children with disruptive behavior and self-injury showed the greatest improvement. Sleep quality improved for 88% of subjects with preexisting sleep disturbance. Subjects for whom a follow-up weight was available showed a mean weight increase of 2.8 Â± 1.5 kg during the treatment period. Conclusions: These findings support our clinical impression of improvement on important target behaviors such as aggression, disruptiveness, self-injury, stereotypy, and social withdrawal. Low-dose risperidone appears to be well tolerated in children with DS+ASD, although concerns about weight gain and metabolic alterations may limit its usefulness over the long term in some children.

201,Suicide risk among male substance users in residential treatment: Evaluation of the depression“distress amplification model,"Suicide is a leading cause of death and is significantly elevated among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). However, specific mechanisms of suicide in this population have been relatively understudied. The depressionâ€“distress amplification model posits that one pathway to increased suicide risk is through the intensification of depressive symptoms by anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. However, this model has not been tested in populations with SUDs. The current study tested the depressionâ€“distress amplification model of suicide risk and examined the relation of anxiety sensitivity to suicide risk in a sample of men in residential SUD treatment. Consistent with prior work, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns were significantly associated with suicide risk. Moreover, and consistent with the depressionâ€“distress amplification model, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns related to elevated suicide risk among those with a current major depressive episode specifically, above and beyond insomnia (another risk factor for suicide) and relevant covariates. The results of this study corroborate the relevance of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and the depressionâ€“distress amplification model to suicide risk in an at-risk clinical sample of SUD patients. Findings suggest the importance of assessing anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and targeting this vulnerability through brief interventions to reduce suicide risk.

202,Reversible lamotrigine-induced neurobehavioral disturbances in children with epilepsy,"A retrospective review was performed in patients who developed neurobehavioral adverse reactions to lamotrigine. Data were obtained from interviews, examinations, and routine medical records. There were 7 male and 2 female patients with epilepsy with a mean age of 5 years. All 9 patients became hyperactive and agitated over a broad range of lamotrigine dosing (0.7-14.0 mg/kg per d). Five patients developed self-injurious and violent behaviors. Two patients developed severe insomnia. The most affected patient was a 6-year-old boy whose mood and affect became extremely volatile. He also experienced threatening visual and auditory hallucinations and insomnia. All 9 patients had dramatic improvement and/or resolution of the adverse neurobehavioral effects following discontinuation or reduction of lamotrigine. Reversible, severe neurobehavioral disturbances associated with lamotrigine therapy have not been reported in the literature. While idiosyncratic and uncommon, this is a potentially significant, clinical side effect. Further studies are necessary to clarify the population at risk.

Latent class analysis identified three groups of adolescents: a low-risk group (57.8%) including pupils with low or very low frequency of risk behaviors; a high-risk group (13.2%) including pupils who scored high on all risk behaviors, and a third group (invisible"" risk 29%) including pupils who were positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames for reasons not related to school or work sedentary behavior and reduced sleep. Pupils in the ""invisible"" risk group compared with the high-risk group had a similar prevalence of suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%) subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%) and depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%). The prevalence of suicide attempts was 5.9% in the ""invisible"" group 10.1% in the high-risk group and 1.7% in the low-risk group. The prevalence of all risk behaviors increased with age and most of them were significantly more frequent among boys. Girls were significantly more likely to experience internalizing (emotional) psychiatric symptoms.

204,Insomnia and suicidal behaviour in prisoners,"Insomnia has been associated with suicidality. Prisoners have an increased risk of both insomnia and suicidal behaviour. Therefore, it was decided to examine for a relationship between insomnia and suicidal behaviour in a large group of 1420 prisoners. Prisoners had a semi-structured psychiatric interview, which included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Spielberg Anger Expression Inventory and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. It was found that 568 (61.2%) of the prisoners scored in the insomnia cluster of the HDRS and that 183 (12.8%) had attempted suicide. Regression analyses showed that insomnia was significantly and independently associated with a lifetime history of attempting suicide. Insomnia was also significantly related to actual suicidality. After controlling for confounders, axis 1 psychiatric disorder, childhood trauma, neuroticism, low resilience, and anger were significantly associated with insomnia in male prisoners. These data suggest the possibility of a relationship between insomnia and suicidality in prisoners. Assessing insomnia may be helpful when evaluating the risk of suicidality in prisoners.

205,Are sedatives and hypnotics associated with increased suicide risk of suicide in the elderly?,"Background: While antidepressant-induced suicidality is a concern in younger age groups, there is mounting evidence that these drugs may reduce suicidality in the elderly. Regarding a possible association between other types of psychoactive drugs and suicide, results are inconclusive. Sedatives and hypnotics are widely prescribed to elderly persons with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. The aim of this case-control study was to determine whether specific types of psychoactive drugs were associated with suicide risk in late life, after controlling for appropriate indications.; Methods: The study area included the city of Gothenburg and two adjacent counties (total 65+ population 210 703 at the start of the study). A case controlled study of elderly (65+) suicides was performed and close informants for 85 suicide cases (46 men, 39 women mean age 75 years) were interviewed by a psychiatrist. A population based comparison group (n = 153) was created and interviewed face-to-face. Primary care and psychiatric records were reviewed for both suicide cases and comparison subjects. All available information was used to determine past-month mental disorders in accordance with DSM-IV.; Results: Antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedatives and hypnotics were associated with increased suicide risk in the crude analysis. After adjustment for affective and anxiety disorders neither antidepressants in general nor SSRIs showed an association with suicide. Antipsychotics had no association with suicide after adjustment for psychotic disorders. Sedative treatment was associated with an almost fourteen-fold increase of suicide risk in the crude analyses and remained an independent risk factor for suicide even after adjustment for any DSM-IV disorder. Having a current prescription for a hypnotic was associated with a four-fold increase in suicide risk in the adjusted model.; Conclusion: Sedatives and hypnotics were both associated with increased risk for suicide after adjustment for appropriate indications. Given the extremely high prescription rates, a careful evaluation of the suicide risk should always precede prescribing a sedative or hypnotic to an elderly individual.;Hypnotics and Sedatives/*adverse effects, Suicide/*psychology, Suicide/*trends, Age Factors, Aged, Case-Control Studies, Drug Prescriptions/statistics & numerical data, Female, Humans, Male, Risk Factors, Suicide/statistics & numerical data, Sweden/epidemiology","Carlsten, Anders & Waern, Margda",0,205

All PHYs who were assigned to scenario 1 recognized DEP, and 49% (38 of 78) of those assigned to scenario 2 diagnosed DEP. Of those recognizing DEP, 72% and 42% queried patients about anhedonia and mood, respectively. DEP was not diagnosed if fewer than 2 DSM-III-R criteria were explored. Management for scenario 1 included antidepressant prescribing (94%), scheduling of follow-up visits within 2 wks (61%), and exploration of suicidal ideation (69.4%). For scenario 2, management included over-the-counter analgesics for the headache (84%), exercise (63%), antidepressant prescribing (53%), recommendation for ongoing counseling (100%), and follow-up within 2 wks (42%). Major DEP is recognized in primary care at a very high rate, with practice guidelines for its recognition and management often followed.

Two researchers selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.; Results: Sixty studies were included. Of 38 studies of depression, 33 observed more depression in breast cancer survivors; this was statistically significant in 19 studies overall, including six of seven where depression was ascertained clinically, three of four studies of antidepressants, and 13 of 31 that quantified depressive symptoms. Of 21 studies of anxiety, 17 observed more anxiety in breast cancer survivors, statistically significant in 11 studies overall, including two of four with clinical/prescription-based outcomes, and in eight of 17 of anxiety symptoms. Breast cancer survivors also had statistically significantly increased symptoms/frequency of neurocognitive dysfunction (18 of 24 studies), sexual dysfunctions (5 of 6 studies), sleep disturbance (5 of 5 studies), stress-related disorders/PTSD (2 of 3 studies), suicide (2 of 2 studies), somatisation (2 of 2 studies), and bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders (1 of 1 study each). Studies were heterogeneous in terms of participants' characteristics, time since diagnosis, ascertainment of outcomes, and measures reported. Approximately one-half of the studies were at high risk of selection bias and confounding by socio-economic status.; Conclusions: There is compelling evidence of an increased risk of anxiety, depression and suicide, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunctions in breast cancer survivors compared with women with no prior cancer. This information can be used to support evidence-based prevention and management strategies. Further population-based and longitudinal research would help to better characterize these associations.; ","Carreira, Helena; Williams, Rachael; MÃ¼ller, Martin; Harewood, Rhea; Stanway, Susannah & Bhaskaran, Krishnan",0,207
208,"The safety, tolerability and risks associated with the use of newer generation antidepressant drugs: A critical review of the literature","Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

209,Phenotypic effects of a bipolar liability gene among individuals with major depressive disorder,"Variations in voltage-dependent calcium channel L-type, alpha 1C subunit (CAC1C) gene have been associated with bipolar disorder in a recent meta- analysis of genome-wide association studies [Ferreira et al., 2008]. The impact of these variations on other psychiatric disorders has not been yet investigated. Caucasian non-Hispanic participants in the STAR*D study of treatment for depression for whom D was available (N = 1213) were genotyped at two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10848635 and rs1006737) in the CAC1C gene. We examined putative phenotypic indicators of bipolarity among patients with major depression and elements of longitudinal course suggestive of latent bipolarity. We also considered remission and depression severity following citalopram treatment. The rs10848635 risk allele was significantly associated with lower levels of baseline agitation (P = 0.03; beta = -0.09). The rs1006737 risk allele was significantly associated with lesser baseline depression severity (P = 0.04; beta = -0.4) and decreased likelihood of insomnia (P = 0.047; beta = -0.22). Both markers were associated with an increased risk of citalopram-emergent suicidality (rs10848635: OR = 1.29, P = 0.04; rs1006737: OR = 1.34, P = 0.02).

The cohort included 204 patients diagnosed as bipolar disorder, mania and 33 diagnosed as bipolar disorder, mixed. Ratings were based on patient interview and observation on the wards.The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic efficiency of each of the 9 DSM-III-R criteria for major depression in this cohort were calculated. As predicted, 4 of the major depression criteria had low diagnostic utility, with PPV's less than 0.3. Those items were: weight change, sleep disturbance, psychomotor change, and diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness. Four symptoms (anhedonia, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation) had acceptable utility for the diagnosis of mixed states.

However, the literature on OUD and opioid-related chemical coping (OrCC) in chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) is heterogeneous, with most studies conducted in the United States. We performed a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study to address OrCC in long-term opioid therapy (LtOT) for CNCP in South Korea. The objectives were to determine the frequency and predictors of OrCC. We included 258 patients. Among them, fifty-five (21%) patients showed OrCC. The sample had high pain catastrophizing (â‰¥30 points; 66%), moderate-severe insomnia (â‰¥15 points; 63%), low resilience (68 points), and high suicidal ideation (67%). OrCC patients had greater pain interference (85.18% vs. 58.28%, p = 0.017) and lower satisfaction with the LtOT (56.4% vs. 78.3%, p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, alcohol abuse (OR = 6.84, p = 0.001), prescription drugs abuse (OR = 19.32, p = 0.016), functional pain (OR = 12.96, p < 0.001), head and neck pain (OR = 2.48, p = 0.039), MEDD (morphine equivalent daily dose) â‰¥ 200 mg/day (OR = 3.48, p = 0.006), and ongoing litigation (OR = 2.33, p = 0.047) were significant predictors of OrCC. In conclusion, the break-out of OrCC in CNCP in South Korea was comparable to those in countries with high opioid consumption, such as the United States, regardless of the country's opioid consumption rate.; chemical coping, chronic noncancer pain, frequency, long-term opioids, opioid use disorder, opioids, risk factors","CastaÃ±eda, Anyela Marcela; Lee, Chang-Soon; Kim, Yong-Chul; Lee, Dasom & Moon, Jee Youn",0,211
212,"Suicide risk, temperament traits, and sleep quality in patients with refractory epilepsy","Objectives: The objective of the study was to access the suicide risk (SR) in patients with refractory epilepsy and its association with temperament and sleep quality. Methods: A total of 50 consecutive patients referred for epilepsy surgery evaluation in the Porto Alegre Epilepsy Surgery Program were included. All patients had a detailed neurologic and psychiatric evaluation, including video-electroencephalogram (VEEG), high-resolution magnetic ressonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychologic assessment. In addition, structured questionnaires were applied: module C of the MINI-plus (International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Brazilian version 5.0.0), Affective and Emotional Composite Temperament Scale (AFECTS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Ten patients (20.0%) showed an increased SR. The most frequent location of the epileptic focus was in the temporal lobe (50%; n=25). Final diagnosis on VEEG comprised epilepsy in 74.0% (n=37), psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) in 8.0% (n=4), and both in 12%. Thirty patients (60.0%) received surgery indication. Mood disorders were the main psychiatric diagnosis, found in 19 subjects (70.4%), with major depressive disorder (MDD) encountered in 15 patients (55.6%). In the group, SR was more frequent in patients with sleep disorders (p=0.001) and elevated scores of high emotional sensitivity (p=0.003). Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with highly refractory epilepsy, there was a significant association between SR, sleep disorders, and high emotional sensitivity. Careful evaluation of these factors should be performed in these patients to fully access SR.

213,Restless legs syndromeassociated MEIS1 risk variant influences iron homeostasis,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep disorder that is linked to disturbed iron homeostasis. Genetic studies identified MEIS1 as an RLS-predisposing gene, where the RLS risk haplotype is associated with decreased MEIS1 mR and protein expression. We show here that R interference treatment of the MEIS1 worm orthologue increases ferritin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the RLS-associated haplotype leads to increased expression of ferritin and DMT1 in RLS brain tissues. Additionally, human cells cultured under iron-deficient conditions show reduced MEIS1 expression. Our data establish a link between the RLS MEIS1 gene and iron metabolism.

214,A direct interaction between two Restless Legs Syndrome predisposing genes: MEIS1 and SKOR1,"Restless Legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder for which the genetic contribution remains poorly explained. In 2007, the first large scale genome wide association study (GWAS) identified three genomic regions associated with RLS. MEIS1, BTBD9 and MAP2K5/SKOR1 are the only known genes located within these loci and their association with RLS was subsequently confirmed in a number of follow up GWAS. Following this finding, our group reported the MEIS1 risk haplotype to be associated with its decreased expression at the mR and protein levels. Here we report the effect of the risk variants of the three other genes strongly associated with RLS. While these variants had no effect on the mR levels of the genes harboring them, we find that the homeobox transcription factor MEIS1 positively regulates the expression of the transcription co-repressor SKOR1. This regulation appears mediated through the binding of MEIS1 at two specific sites located in the SKOR1 promoter region and is modified by an RLS associated SNP in the promoter region of the gene. Our findings directly link MEIS1 and SKOR1, two significantly associated genes with RLS and also prioritize SKOR1 over MAP2K5 in the RLS associated intergenic region of MAP2K5/SKOR1 found by GWAS.; ","Catoire, Helene; Sarayloo, Faezeh; Mourabit Amari, Karim; Apuzzo, Sergio; Grant, Alanna; Rochefort, Daniel; Xiong, Lan; Montplaisir, Jacques; Earley, Christopher J.; Turecki, Gustavo; Dion, Patrick A. & Rouleau, Guy A.",0,214
215,Staying up at night: Overlapping bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in an adolescent with autism spectrum disorder,"Presents a case report of S. a 16-year-old girl with a reported history of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), nonverbal learning disability (NVLD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). S. was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit because of worsening intrusive thoughts and active suicidal ideation (SI) with a plan. S was referred to the ED for poorly controlled anxiety and intrusive thoughts, with a suicidal plan. In S.â€™s case, the final diagnosis was thought to be OCD, and the decision was made for a retrial of fluoxetine to target anxiety, ruminations, obsessions, and compulsions. Although her symptoms could be seen as early manifestations of bipolar disorder, despite her genetic predisposition, it was formulated that these symptoms could all be parsimoniously explained by uncontrolled OCD. S.â€™s insomnia and rumination were not accompanied by grandiosity, pressured speech, increased goal directed activities, or impulsivity, therefore providing less support for a diagnosis of an acute manic or mixed episode. Future research to facilitate understanding of the complicated manifestations of ASD and disentanglement of the comorbidities is certainly warranted.

216,"Annual Research Review: Suicide among youth - epidemiology, (potential) etiology, and treatment","Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death and a complex clinical outcome. Here, we summarize the current state of research pertaining to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth. We review their definitions/measurement and phenomenology, epidemiology, potential etiological mechanisms, and psychological treatment and prevention efforts.; Results: We identify key patterns and gaps in knowledge that should guide future work. Regarding epidemiology, the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth varies across countries and sociodemographic populations. Despite this, studies are rarely conducted cross-nationally and do not uniformly account for high-risk populations. Regarding etiology, the majority of risk factors have been identified within the realm of environmental and psychological factors (notably negative affect-related processes), and most frequently using self-report measures. Little research has spanned across additional units of analyses including behavior, physiology, molecules, cells, and genes. Finally, there has been growing evidence in support of select psychotherapeutic treatment and prevention strategies, and preliminary evidence for technology-based interventions.; Conclusions: There is much work to be done to better understand suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth. We strongly encourage future research to: (1) continue improving the conceptualization and operationalization of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; (2) improve etiological understanding by focusing on individual (preferably malleable) mechanisms; (3) improve etiological understanding also by integrating findings across multiple units of analyses and developing short-term prediction models; (4) demonstrate greater developmental sensitivity overall; and (5) account for diverse high-risk populations via sampling and reporting of sample characteristics. These serve as initial steps to improve the scientific approach, knowledge base, and ultimately prevention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth.; Â© 2017 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.Suicide, correlates, prevention, risk factors, treatment","Cha, Christine B.; Franz, Peter J.; M GuzmÃ¡n, Eleonora; Glenn, Catherine R.; Kleiman, Evan M. & Nock, Matthew K.",0,216
217,Factors affecting the risk of behaviour problems in children with severe intellectual disability,"In order to examine the importance of a range of potential risk factors for behaviour problems in children with severe intellectual disability, a sample was identified by the administration of a screening version of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) to 139 parents of children aged 4â€“11 yrs attending 6 special needs schools in 3 adjacent inner London boroughs. Parents whose children had a VABS standard score of â‰¤50 were interviewed using the Disability Assessment Schedule and both parents and teachers completed the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist. Most behaviour problems were more common in ambulant children, but problems less dependent on the ability to walk, such as sleeping difficulties, screaming, and self-injury, were equally common in ambulant and non-ambulant children. Among ambulant children, there were few significant associations between the severity of the child's behaviour problems and the age or sex of the child, the presence or absence of epilepsy, and various indices of socio-economic disadvantage. Sleeping difficulties, overactivity, self-injury, destructive behaviour, and autistic features, such as social withdrawal and stereotypes, were strongly associated with skills deficits, but aggression, temper tantrums, and general disruptive behaviour were not.

218,Predictors of suicide attempt among those with depression in an Indian sample: A brief report,"Background: Cultural variation may influence the impact of different risk factors of suicide. Indian data about risk factors for suicidal attempt among those with major depressive disorder is lacking. Method: Seventy-five consecutive consenting patients with major depressive disorder of severe intensity according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research participated in this study. They were evaluated by the Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and the Suicidal Ideation Scale. Results: Patients who attempted suicide had significantly more past suicidal attempts, suicidal ideation, early insomnia, middle insomnia, and total Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed severity of suicidal ideation as the most significant predictor of suicidal attempts. Early insomnia and lack of insight to illness approached significance. Conclusion: Presence of severe suicidal ideation, lack of insight and difficulty in falling asleep are important factors to consider for understanding suicidal attempts among those with depression.

219,Insomnia in alcohol dependence: Predictors of symptoms in a sample of veterans referred from primary care,"Objective: Patients with alcohol dependence presenting for treatment may have multiple associated coâ€morbid conditions and limited social supports, which complicate treatment. Each of these factors has been independently associated with complaints of insomnia. In this preliminary study, we investigated the relations between insomnia complaints and socioâ€demographic factors and psychiatric comorbidity in treatmentâ€seeking patients with alcohol dependence. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review on 84 consecutive patients referred to the Behavioral Health Laboratory of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center for evaluation of psychiatric and substance use disorders. Patients met DSMâ€IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence and completed a series of selfâ€assessments of sleep. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine the relations amongst the variables of interest. Results: In multivariable models, Sleep Latency was significantly greater in individuals without partners (p = .01), those with psychiatric disorders (p = .03) and smokers (p = .01), with a non-significant trend for those with pastâ€year suicidal ideation. No significant predictor of Wake Time After Sleep Onset was seen. Poor Sleep Quality was predicted by younger age (OR = .93 [.88, .98], p = .004) and the presence of a psychiatric disorder (OR = 20.80 [4, 102], p = .0002), with a nonâ€significant trend for suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms in treatmentâ€seeking alcohol dependent patients should prompt consideration of the individualsâ€™ psychiatric and psychosocial features.

220,Suicidal ideation in veterans misusing alcohol: Relationships with insomnia symptoms and sleep duration,"Objective: The aim of this investigation was to assess the relationships between suicidal ideation and insomnia symptoms in Veterans misusing alcohol. Method: Data were extracted in this retrospective chart review of Veterans referred from primary care for a behavioral health evaluation (N = 161) based on evidence of heavy drinking, drug use or another behavioral problem. Suicidal ideation (SI) was assessed using the Paykel questionnaire. Insomnia symptoms were assessed with standard diary questions in an interview format and pertained to sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset time (WASO), sleep quality (SQ), and habitual sleep duration (HSD). The relations between suicidal ideation and insomnia symptoms were assessed using ordinal regression analyses adjusted for socio-demographic, psychiatric and addiction-related variables. Results: Suicidal ideation was reported in 62 (39%) of the Veterans interviewed. In a multivariable model, only inadequate SQ was associated with suicidal ideation. Short sleepers were more likely to endorse suicidal ideation and have attempted suicide in the past year. In addition, older age, inadequate financial status, and the presence of a psychiatric disorder were also significantly associated with suicidal ideation in most of the adjusted models. Conclusion: Given their association with suicidal ideation, insomnia symptoms in Veterans misusing alcohol should prompt an assessment of underlying psychiatric and social factors.

221,Sleep Duration and Insomnia Symptoms as Risk Factors for Suicidal Ideation in a Nationally Representative Sample,"Objective: Suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion) has been increasingly linked with difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, and early morning awakenings. However, the relationship between suicidal behavior and sleep duration abnormalities is unclear, especially at the population level. The present study used a nationally representative sample to examine the association of suicidal ideation with extreme sleep durations and insomnia symptoms.; Method: Cross-sectional data from adult respondents (â‰¥ 18 years of age, N = 6,228) were extracted from the 2007-2008 wave of the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship of suicidal ideation with sleep duration, global insomnia, and individual insomnia symptoms in models adjusted for sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health-related covariates.; Results: Suicidal ideation was associated with abnormalities of sleep duration. This relationship ceased to exist once the model was adjusted for depressive symptoms. As expected, an increased level of suicidal ideation was consistently associated with insomnia. Of the insomnia symptoms, difficulty maintaining sleep was found to be the most predictive of suicidal ideation, followed by difficulty initiating sleep (P< .05).; Conclusions: Abnormalities of sleep duration and continuity should prompt a clinical assessment for suicide risk.; ","Chakravorty, Subhajit; Siu, H.

222,"Mood, Personality, and Behavior Changes During Treatment with Statins: A Case Series","Psychiatric adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been reported with statin use, but the literature regarding statin-associated mood/behavioral changes remains limited. We sought to elicit information germane to natural history and characteristics of central nervous system/behavioral changes in apparent connection with statin and/or cholesterol-lowering drug use, and delineate mechanisms that may bear on an association. Participants (and/or proxies) self-referred with behavioral and/or mood changes in apparent association with statins completed a survey eliciting cholesterol-lowering drug history, character and impact of behavioral/mood effect, time-course of onset and recovery in relation to drug use/modification, co-occurrence of recognized statin-associated ADRs, and factors relevant to ADR causality determination. Naranjo presumptive ADR causality criteria were assessed. Participants (nÂ =Â 12) reported mood/behavior change that commenced following statin initiation and persisted or progressed with continued use. Reported problems included violent ideation, irritability, depression, and suicide. Problems resolved with drug discontinuation and recurred with rechallenge where attempted. Eight met presumptive criteria for probable"" or ""definite"" causality; others had additional factors not considered in Naranjo criteria that bear on casual likelihood. (1) Simvastatin 80Â mg was followed in 5Â days by irritability/depression culminating in suicide in a man in his 40s (Naranjo criteria: possible causality). (2) Simvastatin 10Â mg was followed within 2Â weeks by depression in a woman in her 50s (probable causality). (3) Atorvastatin 20Â mg was followed in ~1 month by depression and irritability/aggression in a male in his 50s (probable causality). (4) Atorvastatin 10Â mg was followed in several months by aggression/irritability and depression culminating in suicide in a man in his 40s (possible causality). (5) FenofibrateÂ +Â rosuvastatin (unknown dose) later combined with atorvastatin were followed in 1Â month by aggression/irritability in a male in his 30s (probable causality). (6) Lovastatin (unknown dose and time-course to reaction) was followed by depression dyscontrol of bipolar disorder and suicide attempts in a male in his 40s (possible causality). (7) Atorvastatin 20Â mg was followed within 2Â weeks by cognitive compromise and nightmares depression and anxiety culminating in suicide in a man in his teens (definite causality). (8) Simvastatin 10Â mg was followed (time-course not recalled) by depression aggression/irritability culminating in suicide in a man in his 60s (possible causality). (9) Simvastatin 20Â mg then atorvastatin 10Â mg were followed (time-course not provided) by irritability/aggression in a man in his 60s (definite causality). (10) Atorvastatin 10 then 20 then 40Â mg were followed shortly after the dose increase by violent ideation and anxiety in a man in his 30s (probable causality). (11) Atorvastatin 20Â mg and then simvastatin 20Â mg were followed in 2Â weeks by aggression/irritability in a man in his 50s (definite causality). (12) Lovastatin rosuvastatin atorvastatin and simvastatin at varying doses were followed as quickly as 1Â day by aggression irritability and violent ideation in a man in his 40s (definite causality).

223,Eveningness and insomnia: Independent risk factors of nonremission in major depressive disorder,"Background: It is unclear whether there is an association between chronotype and nonremission of depression, and whether the association is related to the confounding effect of insomnia. Method: A cohort of patients with major depressive disorder were assessed for chronotype (by Morningness-Eveningness Questinnaire [MEQ]), depressive symptoms, insomnia severity and clinical outcomes in a naturalistic follow-up study. Results: Of the 253 recruited subjects (age 50.8 Â± 10.2 y; female: 82.6%; response rate 90.0%), 19.4%, 56.1% and 24.5% patients were classified as eveningness, intermediate, and morningness, respectively. Evening-type subjects had higher insomnia severity, more severe depressive symptoms, and higher suicidality. Eveningness was associated with nonremission of depression with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-8.34, P < 0.01), independent of insomnia severity. In addition, insomnia was an independent significant factor in contributing to nonremission of depression (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05-1.19, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The independent association of eveningness with nonremission of depression suggested a significant underpinning of circadian involvement in major depressive disorder. Our findings support the need for a comprehensive assessment of sleep and circadian disturbances as well as integration of sleep and chronotherapeutic intervention in the management of depression.

224,Irritable bowel syndrome and migraine: bystanders or partners?,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and migraine are distinct clinical disorders. Apart from the characteristics of chronic and recurrent pain in nature, these pain-related disorders apparently share many similarities. For example, IBS is female predominant with community prevalence about 5-10%, whereas that of migraine is 1-3% also showing female predominance. They are often associated with many somatic and psychiatric comorbidities in terms of fibromyaglia, chronic fatigue syndrome, interstitial cystitis, insomnia and depression etc., even the IBS subjects may have coexisted migraine with an estimated odds ratio of 2.66. They similarly reduce the quality of life of victims leading to the social, medical and economic burdens. Their pathogeneses have been somewhat addressed in relation to biopsychosocial dysfunction, heredity, genetic polymorphism, central/visceral hypersensitivity, somatic/cutaneous allodynia, neurolimbic pain network, gonadal hormones and abuses etc. Both disorders are diagnosed according to the symptomatically based criteria. Multidisciplinary managements such as receptor target new drugs, melantonin, antispasmodics, and psychological drugs and measures, complementary and alternatives etc. are recommended to treat them although the used agents may not be necessarily the same. Finally, the prognosis of IBS is pretty good, whereas that of migraine is less fair since suicide attempt and stroke are at risk. In conclusion, both distinct chronic pain disorders to share many similarities among various aspects probably suggest that they may locate within the same spectrum of a pain-centered disorder such as central sensitization syndromes. The true pathogenesis to involve these disorders remains to be clarified in the future.; Biopsychosocial model, Comorbidity, Irritable bowel syndrome, Migraine, Quality of life","Chang, Full-Young & Lu, Ching-Liang",1,224
225,"The role of substance use, smoking, and inflammation in risk for suicidal behavior","Background: Alcohol and substance use disorders are important predictors for suicidal behavior. However, the role of individual substances as proximal risk factors for suicidal behavior and the mechanisms through which substance use affect risk are not entirely clear. We examine whether the frequency of substance use and whether biological markers in the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways are associated with clinical risk factors of suicidal behavior of aggression, impulsivity, hopelessness, and poor sleep. Methods: The sample consisted of psychiatric inpatients, aged 15â€“30 years, admitted for suicide attempt (n = 38), suicidal ideation (n = 40); and healthy controls (n = 37). We measured hair cortisol concentrations, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity, stimulated production of interleukin- or IL-6, C-reactive protein, and mR expression of GR, SKA2, FKBP5, TNF-Î±, and IL-1Î². Results: Smoking was associated with increased aggression [Î² = 2.9, 95% CI (â€“0.03, 6), p = 0.05], impulsivity [Î² = 3.1, 95% CI (1.6, 4.6), p < 0.001], and poor sleep [Î² = 0.5, 95% CI (0.03, 0.95), p = 0.04] even after controlling for demographics and group. Similarly, TNF-Î± mR was associated with impulsivity [Î² = 0.07, 95% CI (0.01, 0.1), p = 0.02] and hopelessness [Î² = 0.03, 95% CI (0.004, 0.05), p = 0.03]. Smoking tobacco (r = 0.32, p < 0.001) was positively associated with TNF-Î± mR. Limitations: Study limitations include the cross-sectional design, retrospective assessment, and relatively small sample size. Conclusions: Future longitudinal studies are needed to test whether inflammatory markers mediate the relationships between smoking, clinical risk factors, and suicidal behavior; and to examine whether smoking cessation could reduce the risk for suicidal behavior in at-risk patients.

227,Insomnia in young men and subsequent depression The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study,"The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study, a long-term prospective study, was used to study the relation between self-reported sleep disturbances and subsequent clinical depression and psychiatric distress. A total of 1,053 men provided information on sleep habits during medical school at The Johns Hopkins University (classes of 1948-1964) and have been followed since graduation. During a median follow-up period of 34 years (range 1-45), 101 men developed clinical depression (cumulative incidence at 40 years, 12.2%), including 13 suicides. In Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted for age at graduation, class year, parental history of clinical depression, coffee drinking, and measures of temperament, the relative risk of clinical depression was greater in those who reported insomnia in medical school (relative risk (RR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.3) compared with those who did not and greater in those with difficulty sleeping under stress in medical school (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) compared with those who did not report difficulty. There were weaker associations for those who reported poor quality of sleep (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.9) and sleep duration of 7 hours or less (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.3) with development of clinical depression. Similar associations were observed between reports of sleep disturbances in medical school and psychiatric distress assessed in 1988 by the General Health Questionnaire.

228,Nonpsychiatric health problems among psychiatric inpatients with intellectual disabilities,"Background: Physical distress resulting from medical problems has been found to cause increased behaviour problems in patients with intellectual disabilities (ID). Despite this fact, little has been documented on the medical problems of individuals with ID admitted for inpatient psychiatric care. We conducted an exploratory investigation based on a retrospective chart review of the medical problems and medications for 198 people with ID who had been admitted to a specialised inpatient psychiatric unit. Most patients were referred for admission because of aggressive, disruptive and selfâ€injurious behaviours. The average length of stay was 17.6 days. Methods: We tallied the total number of medical problems and medications listed in the patients' discharge summaries. Because longer stays are disruptive, costly and associated with greater overall impairment, we examined the relationship between length of stay and frequency of discharge medical diagnoses. We also assessed whether or not the number of psychoactive medications correlated with the number of medical diagnoses. The effects of other demographic and diagnostic variables on rates of medical diagnoses and medications were also evaluated, including gender, age group (16-25, 26-45, 46-60, >60), level of ID (mild, moderate or severe ID) and diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder or Down syndrome (DS). Results: Inpatients with a higher number of medical diagnoses had longer lengths of stay (Spearman r = + 0.32, P < 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between number of psychoactive medications and number of medical problems (Spearman r = +0.32, P < 0.0001). The most frequent medical comorbidity was constipation, reported in 60% of the inpatients (n = 118), while gastroâ€esophageal reflux disease was identified in 38% (n = 75). Older inpatients had an increased number of medical problems, as might be expected, but a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder, gender and level of ID had no detectible effect on rates of either medical diagnoses or medications. There were only 13 inpatients with DS; in this modest sample, it was found that they had higher rates of osteoarthritis, cardiac problems, hearing loss, hypothyroidism and sleep apnoea than peers without DS, as is consistent with previous findings on overrepresented conditions in this trisomy. Conclusions: In the present study, individuals with ID admitted for inpatient psychiatric care exhibited high rates of medical problems, and these were associated with duration of inpatient stay. Based on these findings, further investigation of the effects of medical problems on behaviour among individuals with ID admitted for inpatient psychiatric care is warranted.

229,Preliminary analysis of age of illness onset effects on symptom profiles in major depressive disorder,"Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent across the lifespan, but relatively little is known about how age of illness onset impacts the cognitive and affective presentation of MDD. Method: We explore depressive symptoms and cognition in 70 adults (30-89 years old) with MDD. Participants were divided into three groups on the basis of age of MDD onset: early (< 30 years), midlife (30-49.9 years), and late (> 50 years). Symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; principal component analysis was used to create symptom component scores. Cognitive functions were measured. Results: The late-onset group were significantly older than the early-onset and midlife-onset groups. Analysis controlled for age and hemoglobin A1c levels, as some participants had diabetes. The late-onset group demonstrated greater weight loss and gastrointestinal symptoms compared with the early-onset group. Suicidal thoughts and sleep disturbance were higher in both the early-onset and late-onset groups compared with the midlife-onset group. Correlations between symptom components and cognitive domains varied by age-of-onset group. Discussion: This preliminary analysis demonstrates cognitive and affective profiles that are both unique to age of onset and common across MDD. Symptom profiles may assist in identifying factors influencing depression and enhance the clinical evaluation and care of individuals struggling with the effects of depression across the lifespan.

230,Factors associated With burnout among French digestive surgeons in training: results of a national survey on 328 residents and fellows,"Background: Digestive surgery training is notoriously difficult and medical students chooseÂ this path less and less often leading to a veritable demographic crisis for this specialty in France. The aim of this study was to evaluate the working conditions to measure the prevalence of burnout syndrome (BOS) and to identify potential risk factors to implement preventive measures and appropriate support.; Methods: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. An anonymous questionnaire was sent by e-mail to 500 French digestive surgeons in training (residents and fellows).; Results: The response rate was 65.6%. The mean working week was 75.7Â hours (Â±12) and the mean number of night shifts was 5.3 (Â±1.6)/month. Sixty-seven percent of respondents had trouble sleeping and 12% reported suicidal thoughts. High-emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment low scores wereÂ observed respectively in 24.7%, 44.6%, and 47%, corresponding to a high score of BOS in 52%.; Conclusions: This study showed a high rate of BOS in French digestive surgeons in training and a worrying rate of suicide ideation.; Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

231,"Depression, chronic pain, and suicide by overdose: on the edge","Comorbid conditions that pose risks for suicide, especially depression, are prevalent in people living with chronic pain. The true numbers of failed attempts and successful suicides are unknown and may never be determined. Yet, risk factors for suicidal ideation are so high in this population that it must be assumed that some proportion of those who die of drug overdoses might have intended to end their lives, not just temporarily relieve their pain. The purpose of this manuscript is to highlight to clinicians the important association between chronic pain and intentional self-harm. Contemporary understanding of the epidemiology of depression and suicide and the relationship to chronic pain will be reviewed.

232,Sleep disorders and suicidal ideation in patients with depressive disorder,"An intrinsic association between suicidal ideation and sleep disorders in patients with depressive disorder has been observed in recent studies. This study was conducted in order to examine the relationship between suicidal ideation and sleep disorders, such as insomnia and excessive sleepiness, in outpatients with major depressive disorder. Seventy patients with diagnoses of major depressive disorder were interviewed and assessed with the Sleep Habits Questionnaire and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI). Data analyses were performed through descriptive analysis, Students t-test, Chi-square test and logistic regression model, with a statistical significance of 5%. In this study, depressed patients had high SSI scores (6.12+/-2.67), particularly for active suicidal ideation (1.61+/-0.39) and specific plans for suicide components (1.51+/-0.40). Depressed patients with insomnia had significantly higher SSI scores (7.39+/-2.84), in relation to patients with excessive sleepiness (3.68+/-1.73). Furthermore it was observed that insomniac patients had significantly higher scores on the following components: active suicide ideation, specific plans for suicide and previous suicide attempts. The results of multivariate analysis showed that only insomnia had a significant association with suicidal ideation. Thus, sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, should be considered in the assessment of suicidal risk in outpatients with depressive disorder.;Depressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology, Sleep Wake Disorders/*epidemiology, Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology, Suicide/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires","Chellappa, Sarah Laxhmi & AraÃºjo, John Fontenele",1,232
233,Psychiatric morbidity and post-traumatic symptoms among survivors in the early stage following the 1999 earthquake in Taiwan,"This study reports the clinical psychiatric presentations and post-traumatic symptoms among 525 survivors at Yu-Chyr District in Nantou County who sought psychiatric service in the first month following the devastating earthquake that struck the central area of Taiwan. All subjects received psychiatric interviews and assessments using the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and a checklist for post-traumatic symptoms. The most common psychiatric symptoms reported were insomnia, palpitations, nervousness, and dizziness with headache. Eleven percent of the subjects reported having thought of death or having suicidal ideation. The mean score on the CHQ-12 was 6.43 (S.D.=2.89). The rate of probable psychiatric morbidity as defined by a CHQ-12 score > or =3 was 89.9%. Post-traumatic symptoms were very prevalent, particularly symptoms of re-experiencing the earthquake and hyper-arousal. Factors significantly associated with high psychiatric morbidity were being female, serious destruction of property and house, and personality characteristics of nervousness and obsessiveness. Findings of this study suggest that early psychiatric intervention, including pharmacological treatment for acute stress disorder, is indicated during the early stages following a disastrous earthquake.;Disasters*, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diagnosis, Survivors/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Arousal, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Life Change Events, Male, Middle Aged, Personality Assessment, Risk Factors, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology, Taiwan/epidemiology","Chen, C C; Yeh, T L; Yang, Y K; Chen, S J; Lee, I H; Fu, L S; Yeh, C Y; Hsu, H C; Tsai, W L; Cheng, S H; Chen, L Y & Si, Y C",0,233
234,Clinically significant non-major depression in a community-dwelling elderly population: Epidemiological findings,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the 1-month prevalence, symptom profiles and demographic correlates in late-life clinically significant non-major depression (CSNMD) among a community-dwelling elderly population. Methods: One thousand five hundred subjects aged 65 years and older, who were randomly selected from three communities in Taiwan, received comprehensive psychiatric assessment by trained psychiatrists. Two categorical diagnoses of depressive disorder, including major depression and CSNMD, were made. The 1-month prevalence was calculated. Frequencies of depressive symptoms across CSNMD and major depression were compared. The risks of CSNMD based on demographic characteristics were estimated using multinominal logistic regression. Results: The 1-month prevalence of CSNMD among the community-dwelling elderly was 8.8%. Symptoms of diminished interest, appetite changes, sleep disturbance, worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, trouble in concentrating or indecisiveness, and suicidal thoughts or acts were less frequent in CSNMD than in major depression, but symptoms of depressed mood, psychomotor changes, and fatigue or loss of energy were as frequent in both categories of illness. CSNMD shares similar demographic risks, such as living in an urban area, female gender and low educational status, with major depression. Conclusions: CSNMD is common among community-dwelling elders in Taiwan, and with its identical demographic characteristics, but qualitatively different presentation, we suggest CSNMD may be considered part of a spectrum of severe late life depressions with a distinct manifestation. Major depression and CSNMD may share common demographic characteristics with different manifestation. We conclude that late-life depression is a dimensional disease.

235,Role and attitude of companions on geriatric psychiatry outpatient visits in Taiwan,"The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the role and attitude of people who accompanied geriatric patients to an outpatient psychiatric clinic. The study was conducted at a large university hospital in Taiwan. Participants included 108 patients aged 65 years and older who were seen for their initial psychiatric visit; 81 patients were accompanied. All accompanying people were interviewed to obtain their assumed role and attitude during the visit. Data were gathered prospectively; statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-PC. Accompanied patients (75% of participants) were older than those in the unaccompanied group. Most patients (53.1%) were accompanied by adult children who lived with them. Of the accompanying spouses, 48% were described as a supporter, and 60% showed a positive attitude. Most of the accompanying children acted as critics and speakers. Accompanying people whose responsible patients reported insomnia and suicide attempts showed a significantly positive attitude, whereas people who accompanied alcoholic patients were more negative and assumed a critic role. Many accompanying people requested further examination and drug treatment and expressed concern that the patient may be mentally ill. The role and attitude of accompanying people on the geriatric patient encounter are important factors in promoting patient-doctor communication and trust.

236,Sleep Problems in Relation to Smoking and Alcohol Use in Chinese Adolescents,"This study examined sleep patterns and sleep problems in relation to smoking and alcohol use in Chinese adolescents. A questionnaire survey of 2090 adolescent students was conducted in Lijin County, Shandong, China. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. After adjustment for demographics and internalizing and externalizing problems, poor sleep quality was associated with increased risk of smoking (odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-5.40), alcohol use (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.81-3.89), and getting drunk (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.72-4.57); sleeping 7 hours (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.20-2.43) and sleeping 6 hours or less per night on weekdays (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.25-3.10) were significantly associated with increased risk for alcohol use, and sleeping 6 hours or less per night on weekends (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.18-3.70) were significantly associated with increased risk for getting drunk; and hypnotic medication use was significantly associated with ever smoking (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08-2.99).

237,Trazodoneinduced severe headache,"Presents the case report of a 43-year old male Taiwanese patient who was admitted to the psychiatric acute ward under the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The patient presented the symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia, psychomotor retardation, feelings of guilt, and suicidal ideation. After admission, he received paroxetine 20 mg/day as well as trazodone 100 mg/day and flurazepam 30 mg/day before bedtime for his severe insomnia. Of these medications, he had been treated with paroxetine and flurazepam for more than 1 year and had never taken trazodone before this. A new onset of headache, located throughout the occipital area, occurred after awakening on the second day of admission. We intensively monitored vital signs and symptoms. There was no fever, hypertension, tachycardia, spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus, ocular clonus, agitation, diaphoresis, tremor, hyperreflexia, or hypertonia. The patient received standing acetaminophen 500 mg/day for 5 days, but this brought no improvement. Trazodone was decreased from 100 mg/day to 50 mg/day on the sixth day of admission, but the severe headache remained. Trazodone was then discontinued on the seventh day of admission. The headache sharply disappeared the next morning and he was discharged 2 days later.

238,Sexual abuse and lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: To systematically assess the evidence for an association between sexual abuse and a lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorders.; Patients and Methods: We performed a comprehensive search (from January 1980-December 2008, all age groups, any language, any population) of 9 databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CIHL, Current Contents, PsycINFO, ACP Journal Club, CCTR, CDSR, and DARE. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to define the concept areas of sexual abuse and psychiatric disorders and was limited to epidemiological studies. Six independent reviewers extracted descriptive, quality, and outcome data from eligible longitudinal studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled across studies by using the random-effects model. The I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity.; Results: The search yielded 37 eligible studies, 17 case-control and 20 cohort, with 3,162,318 participants. There was a statistically significant association between sexual abuse and a lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorder (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 2.43-3.94), depression (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.14-3.30), eating disorders (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 2.04-3.63), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.59-3.43), sleep disorders (OR, 16.17; 95% CI, 2.06-126.76), and suicide attempts (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 2.98-5.76). Associations persisted regardless of the victim's sex or the age at which abuse occurred. There was no statistically significant association between sexual abuse and a diagnosis of schizophrenia or somatoform disorders. No longitudinal studies that assessed bipolar disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder were found. Associations between sexual abuse and depression, eating disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder were strengthened by a history of rape.; Conclusion: A history of sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of a lifetime diagnosis of multiple psychiatric disorders.;Mental Disorders/*epidemiology, Mental Disorders/*etiology, Sex Offenses/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology, Case-Control Studies, Child, Depression/epidemiology, Epidemiologic Research Design, Feeding and Eating Disorders/epidemiology, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology, Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Odds Ratio, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Sex Offenses/psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology, Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data","Chen, Laura P; Murad, M Hassan; Paras, Molly L; Colbenson, Kristina M; Sattler, Amelia L; Goranson, Erin N; Elamin, Mohamed B; Seime, Richard J; Shinozaki, Gen; Prokop, Larry J & Zirakzadeh, Ali",0,238
239,"Aripiprazole-associated acute dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism in a patient with bipolar I disorder","Presents a case report of Mrs Y was a 32-year-old hairstylist with bipolar I disorder and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her first major depressive episode occurred at age 20 years with depressed mood, loss of interest, insomnia, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, and ideas of death. During the following 10 years, she continued to suffer from dysthymia and attempted suicide several times by drug overdose. Several psychotropic medications (ie, paroxetine, bupropion, and quetiapine) had been prescribed. However, she did not have a regular follow-up and had poor drug compliance because she said the prescribed medication increased her appetite and body weight. In September 2010 (age 32 years), she developed a labile mood, pressured speech, hyperactivity, a decreased need for sleep, a flight of ideas, referential delusions, and auditory hallucination for approximately 2 weeks. She became very busy and had many plans. She said people were observing her in the street and she could hear voices condemning her. Her diagnosis was revised to bipolar I disorder, manic episode with psychotic features and she was admitted to our psychiatric ward. Under another 3-week treatment, her manic and psychotic symptoms improved significantly without any extrapyramidal symptom (EPS). She was discharged with a stable mood and appropriate behaviors. At the outpatient follow-up 2 weeks later, she exhibited a euthymic mood and denied any restlessness, body rigidity, hand tremor, or limb stiffness. We have obtained the written inform consent before preparing the report. In conclusion, a young bipolar patient developed acute dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia after a 1-week treatment with aripiprazole 20 mg/d. Interaction between aripiprazole and individual risk factors contributed to this phenomenon. Prompt discontinuation of antipsychotics and augmentation of anticholinergic agents are considered a beneficial method to relieve the patient's suffering. Further study may be required to clarify the exact pathophysiology of aripiprazole-associated acute dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia.

240,Phone-Based Interventions in Adolescent Psychiatry: A Perspective and Proof of Concept Pilot Study With a Focus on Depression and Autism,"Background: Telemedicine has emerged as an innovative platform to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders in a cost-effective fashion. Previous studies have laid the functional framework for monitoring and treating child psychiatric disorders electronically using videoconferencing, mobile phones (smartphones), and Web-based apps. However, phone call and text message (short message service, SMS) interventions in adolescent psychiatry are less studied than other electronic platforms. Further investigations on the development of these interventions are needed.; Objective: The aim of this paper was to explore the utility of text message interventions in adolescent psychiatry and describe a user feedback-driven iterative design process for text message systems.; Methods: We developed automated text message interventions using a platform for both depression (EpxDepression) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; EpxAutism) and conducted 2 pilot studies for each intervention (N=3 and N=6, respectively). The interventions were prescribed by and accessible to the patients' healthcare providers. EpxDepression and EpxAutism utilized an automated system to triage patients into 1 of 3 risk categories based on their text responses and alerted providers directly via phone and an online interface when patients met provider-specified risk criteria. Rapid text-based feedback from participants and interviews with providers allowed for quick iterative cycles to improve interventions.; Results: Patients using EpxDepression had high weekly response rates (100% over 2 to 4 months), but exhibited message fatigue with daily prompts with mean (SD) overall response rates of 66.3% (21.6%) and 64.7% (8.2%) for mood and sleep questionnaires, respectively. In contrast, parents using EpxAutism displayed both high weekly and overall response rates (100% and 85%, respectively, over 1 to 4 months) that did not decay significantly with time. Monthly participant feedback surveys for EpxDepression (7 surveys) and EpxAutism (18 surveys) preliminarily indicated that for both interventions, daily messages constituted the perfect amount"" of contact and that EpxAutism but not EpxDepression improved patient communication with providers. Notably EpxDepression detected thoughts of self-harm in patients before their case managers or caregivers were aware of such ideation.; Conclusions: Text-message interventions in adolescent psychiatry can provide a cost-effective and engaging method to track symptoms behavior and ideation over time. Following the collection of pilot data and feedback from providers and patients larger studies are already underway to validate the clinical utility of EpxDepression and EpxAutism.; Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03002311; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03002311 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6qQtlCIS0).; Â©Robert Yuzen Chen Jordan Robert Feltes William Shun Tzeng Zoe Yunzhu Lu Michael Pan Nan Zhao Rebecca Talkin Kavon Javaherian Anne Glowinski Will Ross.

241,Factor structure of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression Scale in Taiwanese adolescents,"Background: The original study of Radloff (Appl Psychol Meas. 1977. 1:385-401) on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) indicated a 4-factor model in the adult population. However, the factor structure of the CES-D in Asian adolescents has not been extensively validated. The aim of this study was to examine the factor structure of the Chinese version of the CES-D in a large representative Taiwanese adolescent population. Method: A total of 10 116 adolescents completed the Chinese version of the CES-D. We used confirmatory factor analysis to examine the adequacy of 5 models of the factor structure in adolescents who were divided into 4 groups by sex and age. We also enrolled the variables of suicide tendency, insomnia, and peer relationships into the confirmatory factor analysis to examine the factor structure of the CES-D and examined the correlations between the CES-D factors and these variables. Results: The results of this study indicated that the four-factor model (depressed affect, somatic symptoms, interpersonal problems, and positive affect) had the highest validity in Taiwanese adolescents. We also found that although the 4 factors of the CES-D were correlated with each other, their correlations with suicide tendency, insomnia, and peer relationships were different. Conclusions: This study supported the usefulness of the Chinese version of the CES-D as a tool to understand the concept of depression in Taiwanese adolescents.

242,Developing a screening instrument and at-risk profile for nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior in college women and men,"Archival data (N = 1,048 women, 1,136 men) from a mental health survey of college students were used to investigate incidence of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), including cutting. Significant levels (defined as 4-5 lifetime incidents) were found in 9.3% of women and 5.3% of men. The Counseling Center Assessment for Psychological Symptoms (a global symptom inventory) and an assessment of trauma had been field tested with this sample. We randomly partitioned half of these data into a holdout sample and used the remainder to develop an NSSI screening inventory that included (a) 5 womenâ€™s screening items, including 1 item to assess trauma experienced; (b) 11 menâ€™s screening items; and (c) 12 items common to men and women, including depression, dissociation, anger, unwanted thoughts, nightmares or flashbacks, and having witnessed trauma. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis suggested the inventory significantly discriminated NSSI men and women in the holdout sample, p < .001. Cutoff scores were identified to correctly classify about 48% of the true positive male and female NSSI cases, with false positive rates of 13.2% and 8.4% for women and men, respectively.

243,Factors related to selfreported social anxiety symptoms among incoming university students,"Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the lifestyle/social, personality trait and mental factors among incoming university students with higher self-reported social anxiety symptoms (SAS). Methods: A total of 5126 incoming university students were recruited. The test battery included a self-administered questionnaire that examined personal lifestyle, the Measurement of Support Functions, the Chinese Internet Addiction Scale-Revision, the Organizational Citizenship Behaviour Scale, the Social Phobia Inventory, the suicide ideation from the Brief Symptoms Rating Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire. Results: SAS (23.7%) were prevalent. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that the significant predictors of higher levels of SAS were being an undergraduate student and a nonsmoker, having lower Measurement of Support Functions score (poorer social support), having higher Chinese Internet Addiction Scale- Revision score (Internet addiction), having lower Organizational Citizenship Behaviour Scale score (less altruistic behaviour), having suicide ideation and having higher Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire score (poorer sleeper). Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of SAS among university students, it is necessary to build a better strategy to detect students with potential social anxiety-related problems/disorders or other mental problems early on.

This study examines the weighted prevalence and associated risk factors of depression, anxiety and stress among Hong Kong nurses. A total of 850 nurses were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 and multiple logistic regression was used to determine significant relationships between variables. Chronic past-year illness and poor self-perceived mental health were significant correlates of past-week depression, anxiety and stress. It confirmed further positive correlations between depression and divorce, widowhood and separation, job dissatisfaction, disturbance with colleagues, low physical activity levels and sleep problems. Marital status; general medicine; sleep problems, and a lack of leisure significantly correlated with anxiety. Stress was significantly associated with younger age, clinical inexperience, past-year disturbance with colleagues, low physical activity, no leisure and drinking alcohol. Nurses were more depressed, anxious and stressed than the local general population, with over one-third of our respondents classified as subject to these disorders.; Anxiety Disorders/*epidemiology, Depressive Disorder/*epidemiology, Nurses/*psychology, Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Hong Kong/epidemiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Young Adult, anxiety, depression, epidemiology, mental health, nurses, prevalence, stress","Cheung, Teris & Yip, Paul S.

245,Lifestyle and Depression among Hong Kong Nurses,"Recent longitudinal data suggest a close association between depression and lifestyle. Little work to date has estimated the prevalence of depression in the nursing workforce in China, nor considered what lifestyle factors might be correlated with it-a gap filled by the present study. The study's web-based cross-sectional survey solicited data from qualified nurses aged between 21 and 65 registered with the Hong Kong Nursing Council. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 was used to measure 850 nurses for depression, anxiety and symptoms of stress; a generalized linear regression model examined associations between lifestyle factors and depression. Mean depression symptom scores show a downward linear trend for male and female participants. Gender and age, however, did not emerge as significant predictors of depression. Three lifestyles factors (sleep, entertainment and hobbies) showed a significant association with depression.

246,Neurologic treatment strategies in autism: an overview of medical intervention strategies,"Child neurologists are likely to be caring for an increasing number of patients with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD may occur in as many as 1/100 to 1/200 births. It appears to be a multifactorial disease, with many phenotypes or subgroups. No simple treatment is currently approved for curing or managing core symptoms of autism. We rationally propose a symptom-based review of what treatments may offer relief to specific subtypes of clinical behaviors seen in autism.

247,Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in older adults in rural China: A preliminary study,"Background: One purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of conducting epidemiological survey on suicidal thoughts and behaviors (hereafter â€œsuicidal thoughts/behaviorsâ€; i.e., any suicidal ideation, serious ideation, planning, and attempts) among older adults in rural China. Another purpose was to investigate among older people in rural China the prevalence of suicidal thoughts/behaviors, as well as their sociodemographic and clinical correlates. Methods: A randomly selected sample of 263 subjects, 50 years or older, was recruited in a remote rural area of Southwestern China (Mianyang Region, Sichuan Province) and interviewed using structured instruments. Basic sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Results: There was no refusal among approached subjects, and subjects were willing to answer questions on suicidal thoughts/behaviors. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, serious ideation, planning, and attempt was 28.9% (23.4%-34.4%), 19.7% (14.9%-24.6%), 11.4% (7.5%-15.3%), and 5.3% (2.6%-8.1%), respectively. The corresponding 12-month prevalence was 8.8% (5.3%-12.2%), 5.3% (2.6%-8.1%), 2.7% (0.7%-4.6%), and 0%, respectively. The 2-week prevalence was 3.4% (1.2%-5.6%), 2.3% (0.5%-4.1%), 2.3% (0.5%-4.1%), and 0%, respectively. Correlates of suicidal thoughts/behaviors of this group are similar to findings from other community studies, such as female gender, unmarried status, major medical conditions, insomnia, financial difficulties and lower education, depressive symptoms, recent stressful life events, greater life dissatisfaction. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that larger scale epidemiological survey of suicidal thoughts/behaviors on older adults in rural China would be feasible. Suicidal thoughts/behaviors are common among older people in rural China, as seen in this preliminary study, which points to the need for further larger scale investigations.

248,Associations between sleep duration and suicidality in adolescents: A systematic review and dose“response meta-analysis,"Sleep duration has received considerable attention as a potential risk factor of suicidality in youths; however, evidence on the doseâ€“response association between sleep duration and suicidality has not been synthesized. This meta-analysis examined linear and nonlinear doseâ€“response relationships between sleep duration and the risk of suicidality in adolescents and explored potential moderators of the associations. Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I Wanfang Data (Chinese database), and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, were searched from their inception to April 18, 2017. Studies examining the association between sleep duration and suicidality in adolescents were included. A random-effects doseâ€“response model was used to estimate the linear and nonlinear doseâ€“response relationships. We identified 13 reports that included a total of 598,281 participants for a systematic review, and 12 reports were further used for a doseâ€“response meta-analysis. Strong curvilinear doseâ€“response associations were obtained for both suicidal ideation and attempts, with the lowest suicidal ideation and attempt risks at sleep durations of 8 h and 8â€“9 h per day (all Pnonlinearity < 0.001). A linear doseâ€“response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plans (pooled OR = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88â€“0.90) was obtained, indicating that the risk of suicide plans statistically decreased by 11% for every 1-h increase in sleep duration. Depression did not moderate the association between sleep duration and suicidality in youths. Our findings suggest curvilinear doseâ€“response associations between sleep duration and the risks of suicidal ideation and attempts and a linear doseâ€“response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plan risk. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causality.

249,Association between DSM-IV Anxiety Disorders and Suicidal Behaviors in a Community Sample of South Korean Adults,"Objective: There are conflicting reports about whether individual anxiety disorders are independently associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. We examined whether anxiety disorders are related to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a community sample of South Korean adults.; Methods: In-person interviews based on the South Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were conducted to diagnose mental disorders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine whether anxiety disorders were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Each regression model treated lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorders as independent variables. Sociodemographic characteristics, cohabitation status, lifetime history of mood disorders, alcohol use disorders, and psychotic disorders were included as covariates.; Results: Nationally representative sample of 6,510 South Korean adults aged 18-64 years was recruited. Multivariate analysis adjusted for psychiatric comorbidity and sociodemographic variables revealed that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) [2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.27, 4.33)], post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (3.50, 95% CI: 2.16, 5.68), specific phobia (1.55, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.11), social phobia (2.97, 95% CI: 1.27, 6.94), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (5.58, 95% CI: 2.70, 11.6) were associated with suicidal ideation, whereas only social phobia (3.78, 95% CI: 1.41, 10.1) and PTSD (5.13, 95% CI: 2.81, 9.37) were associated with suicide attempts.; Conclusion: Individual anxiety disorders are independently associated with suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts.

250,Psychological and genetic risk factors associated with suicidal behavior in Korean patients with mood disorders,"Introduction: To prevent suicide, a nationwide important issue in Korea, understanding its etiology is essential. This study aimed to delineate the risk factors for suicidal behavior in mood disorder patients in Korea.; Methods: 216 patients with mood disorders were recruited. We measured suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) history and the association of six gene polymorphisms with SB: COMT (rs4680), HTR1A (rs6295), TPH1 (rs1800532), BDNF (rs6265), SLC1A3 (rs2269272), and SLC1A2 (rs4755404).; Results: Patients in the high-SI and SA groups reported more severe depressive, hopelessness, and anxiety symptoms and lower resilience and used less social support-seeking coping than those in the non-significant SI and non-SA groups. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that depressive disorder, depressive symptoms, poor social support, and less social support-seeking coping were significant independent predictors of suicidal ideation. After adjustment for covariates, age, alcohol consumption, and the rs4680 AA genotype in the COMT gene were associated with suicide attempt.; Limitations: The modest sample size and a relatively few candidate genes are limitations of the study. In addition, there is no normal control group and the retrospective evaluation of SA limits the interpretation of the causal relationship with factors affecting SA.; Conclusions: Suicidal behavior in Korean patients with mood disorders may be associated with younger age, alcohol consumption, depressive symptoms, poor social support, less social support-seeking coping, and the COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

251,Suicidal ideation and insomnia symptoms in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Objective: Insomnia symptoms are prevalent in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and are important risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI). However, the significance of SI has not been clearly demonstrated in persons with both OSA and insomnia. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of SI and its relationship with insomnia symptoms, mood, and other relevant factors. Methods: A total of 117 consecutive subjects with untreated OSA (apnea-hypopnea index â‰¥5/h) participated in the study. They completed questionnaires regarding SI ([BDI-II], item 9), insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), depressive mood (modified BDI-II [mBDI-II], which excluded items on SI and sleep disturbances), dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep (DBAS), social support, and quality of life. Results: The overall prevalence of SI was 20.5% in subjects with OSA. A total of 32 subjects (27.4%) reported significant insomnia symptoms (ISI â‰¥ 15). Higher SI was associated with higher scores on ISI, DBAS, and mBDI-II and lower scores on social support and quality of life questionnaires. The severity of insomnia was positively correlated with depressive mood. The relationship between SI and insomnia severity was insignificant after adjusting for depressive symptom severity. Conclusion: Patients with OSA may have SI and insomnia symptoms. Collinearity was observed between sleep and mood disturbances. Yet, it is remarkable to find a significant association between OSA and SI, which are additional contributions to insomnia. This study suggests the necessity of integrated approaches to SI and related factors for the comprehensive treatment of OSA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

252,The Canadian STOP-PAIN project - Part 1: Who are the patients on the waitlists of multidisciplinary pain treatment facilities?,"Purpose: The Canadian STOP-PAIN Project assessed the human and economic burden of chronic pain in individuals on waitlists of Multidisciplinary Pain Treatment Facilities (MPTF). This article presents the patients' bio-psycho-social profile.; Methods: A sample of 728 patients was recruited from waitlists of eight university-affiliated MPTFs across Canada. Subjects completed validated questionnaires to: 1) assess the characteristics and impact of their pain; and 2) evaluate their emotional functioning and quality of life (QoL). Follow-up questionnaires were completed by a subgroup of 271 patients three months later.; Results: Close to 2/3 of the participants reported severe pain (> or = 7/10) that interfered substantially with various aspects of their daily living and QoL. Severe or extremely severe levels of depression were common (50.0%) along with suicidal ideation (34.6%). Patients aged > 60 yr were twice as likely to experience severe pain (> or = 7/10) as their younger counterparts (P = 0.002). Patients with frequent sleep problems were more at risk of reporting severe pain (P < or = 0.003). Intense pain was also associated with a greater tendency to catastrophize (P < 0.0001) severe depressive symptoms (P = 0.003) and higher anger levels (P = 0.016). Small but statistically significant changes in pain intensity and emotional distress were observed over a three-month wait time (all P < 0.05).; Conclusion: This study highlights the severe impairment that patients experience waiting for treatment in MPTFs. Knowing that current facilities cannot meet the clinical demand, it is clear that effective prevention/treatment strategies are needed earlier in primary and secondary care settings to minimize suffering and chronicity.;Waiting Lists*, Pain/*psychology, Pain Clinics/*statistics & numerical data, Activities of Daily Living/psychology, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Canada, Chronic Disease, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depression/etiology, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/physiopathology, Pain Management, Prospective Studies, Quality of Life, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology, Suicide/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires, Time Factors, Young Adult","ChoiniÃ¨re, Manon; Dion, Dominique; Peng, Philip; Banner, Robert; Barton, Pamela M; Boulanger, Aline; Clark, Alexander J; Gordon, Allan S; Guerriere, Denise N; Guertin, Marie-Claude; Intrater, Howard M; Lefort, Sandra M; Lynch, Mary E; Moulin, Dwight E; Ong-Lam, May; Racine, MÃ©lanie; Rashiq, Saifee; Shir, Yoram; Taenzer, Paul & Ware, Mark",1,252

Medical records of suicide attempters who were admitted to a teaching hospital in January 2004--December 2006 were studied. Cluster analysis revealed hidden patterns for repeated and single attempters (n = 418). Repeated attempters had a more complex clinical picture. Symptoms of psychotic illness, borderline personality disorder, and psychosomatic complaints of insomnia and headaches, reports of adverse life events such as unemployment, divorce and quarrels, experience of negative feelings, and usage of alcohol were associated with risk of repeated overdoses with benzodiazepines and paracetamol. The findings have implications for suicide assessments and interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Weiss et al.â€™s Critical Incident History Questionnaire (CIHQ; 2010) measures these variables among law enforcement officers; they reported findings using a sample of officers from large urban departments. We noted the need for replication studies utilizing samples from smaller and rural police agencies. The purpose of this study was to replicate the CIHQ findings from Weiss et al. using a sample (N = 193) of officers from small and midsize police departments and officers whose duties include policing rural and isolated jurisdictions. Frequency and severity findings were similar to those reported by Weiss et al. (2010). Regarding frequency, the present study found the critical incident exposure mean score was 188.5, compared to 168.5 from Weiss et al. (2010). Making a mistake that kills or injures a colleague had the highest mean nomothetic severity rating in both studies. Among the various variables examined in this study, PTSD symptoms demonstrated the strongest association with the exposure indices, based on Spearman rank correlations (r = .26-.46).

We report the case of an 8-year-old boy with SMS. Down syndrome was initially suspected in infancy based on the findings of generalized hypotonia, flat midface, and upslanting palpebral fissures. His sleep had been disturbed since infancy, and self-injurious behavior developed at 2 years. When he was 8 years old, these unusual neurobehavioral features led to suspicion of SMS, and chromosome analysis showed the 17p deletion, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the SMS region. Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux, grade IV, was found at the same time, and he underwent bilateral ureteroplasty. The postoperative course was smooth and he was discharged with antibiotic prophylaxis. His sleep disturbance improved after treatment with melatonin. A high index of suspicion is needed for the timely diagnosis of SMS.

257,The Relationship between Personality Traits with Depressive Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation among Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study at One Medical School in Germany,"Medical students are at increased risk of experiencing mental health problems. Certain personality traits may be associated with elevated vulnerability to study-related stress and poor mental health. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between such personality traits and mental health outcomes among medical students. We drew on cross-sectional data from 251 medical students who had been enrolled for one-year at a medical school in Germany. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) and suicidal ideation was assessed by item 9 from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Personality traits were captured using the Business-Focused Inventory of Personality 6 Factors (BIP-6F). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to quantify the associations between work-related personality factors and mental health outcomes, controlling for demographic and social factors. Odds ratios (ORs) as outcome measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used. After controlling for important confounders, medical students who scored highly on Stability had lower odds of depressive symptoms (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09⁻0.42, p < 0.001) and suicidality (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16⁻0.87, p < 0.05) than those with high scores in other work-related personality factors. Findings also showed that those who scored highly on Dominance had greater odds of depressive symptoms (OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22⁻4.97), p < 0.01).

258,A follow-up study of longterm effects of unemployment on children: Loss of self-esteem and self-destructive behavior among adolescents,"A sample of children of longterm unemployed parents were interviewed as 25-yr olds. Their present living conditions and their experiences during childhood were compared with a simple random sample of the same cohort born in 1967. Results revealed that violence, separation from parents (in care according to files), and parents' addiction problems during childhood were significantly more common in the risk group than in the control group. Their present situation also differed decisively in vocational training, unemployment and psychological problems (lack of self-confidence, sleeping problems, anxiety, and considerations of suicide). The logistic regression model revealed that the factors which statistically could explain the loss of self-esteem were partly due to experiences during childhood and partly to their present situation. Parental unemployment, violence in the home, being bullied in school seems to drain self-esteem. Present unemployment and no vocational training have a statistical effect on their self-esteem, as well as lack of support from a spouse.

Participants (n = 61) were randomized to either an 8-week MBRT course or a no intervention control group. Self-report and physiological data were collected at baseline, post-training, and three months following intervention completion. Attendance, adherence, post-training participant feedback, and interventionist fidelity to protocol all demonstrated feasibility of MBRT for law enforcement officers. Compared to no intervention controls, MBRT participants experienced greater reductions in salivary cortisol, self-reported aggression, organizational stress, burnout, sleep disturbance, and reported increases in psychological flexibility and non-reactivity at post-training; however, group differences were not maintained at three-month follow-up. This initial randomized trial suggests MBRT is a feasible intervention. Outcome data suggest MBRT targets key physiological, psychological, and health risk factors in law enforcement officers, consistent with the potential to improve officer health and public safety. However, follow-up training or ""booster"" sessions may be needed to maintain training gains.

260,"Deployment, Mental Health Problems, Suicidality, and Use of Mental Health Services Among Military Personnel","Following deployment, soldiers may struggle to cope with the after-effects of combat service and experience increased suicidality. Therefore, connection to mental health services is vital. Research regarding the relationship between deployment, suicidality, and mental health connections has been equivocal, with some studies finding a link between deployment history and mental health outcomes, and others not. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of military deployment on mental health and service utilization outcomes using a longitudinal design. Deployment history, mental health visits, symptoms of suicidality, and various mental health outcomes were assessed in a sample of 1,566 Army recruiters at study entry and 18-months follow-up. Deployment history was positively associated with mental health visits, number of major depressive episodes, and acquired capability for suicide at baseline; however, no significant relationship between deployment, mental health visits, and any other suicide or mental health-related outcomes emerged at baseline or follow-up. Findings suggest a disconnection from mental health services among military personnel.

261,The interpersonal theory of suicide: A systematic review and meta-analysis of a decade of cross-national research,"Over the past decade, the interpersonal theory of suicide has contributed to substantial advances in the scientific and clinical understanding of suicide and related conditions. The interpersonal theory of suicide posits that suicidal desire emerges when individuals experience intractable feelings of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness and near-lethal or lethal suicidal behavior occurs in the presence of suicidal desire and capability for suicide. A growing number of studies have tested these posited pathways in various samples; however, these findings have yet to be evaluated meta-analytically. This paper aimed to (a) conduct a systematic review of the unpublished and published, peer-reviewed literature examining the relationship between interpersonal theory constructs and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, (b) conduct meta-analyses testing the interpersonal theory hypotheses, and (c) evaluate the influence of various moderators on these relationships. Four electronic bibliographic databases were searched through the end of March, 2016: PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Hypothesis-driven meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted using 122 distinct unpublished and published samples. Findings supported the interpersonal theory: the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness was significantly associated with suicidal ideation; and the interaction between thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide was significantly related to a greater number of prior suicide attempts. However, effect sizes for these interactions were modest. Alternative configurations of theory variables were similarly useful for predicting suicide risk as theory-consistent pathways. We conclude with limitations and recommendations for the interpersonal theory as a framework for understanding the suicidal spectrum.

262,Insomnia predicts increased perceived burdensomeness and decreased desire for emotional support following an in-laboratory social exclusion paradigm,"Background: Research suggests that insomnia is associated with elevated perceptions of loneliness and social disconnection; however, few quasi-experimental studies have tested the relationship between these constructs. This study examined whether insomnia symptom severity predicts changes in perceptions of interpersonal connectedness and desire for emotional support following in-laboratory participation in a social exclusion paradigm.; Methods: Young adults (Nâ€¯=â€¯70) completed self-report measures assessing constructs of interest before and after engaging in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate whether baseline insomnia symptom severity predicted perceived burdensomeness, desire for emotional support, and thwarted belongingness after playing Cyberball; analyses controlled for baseline perceived burdensomeness, desire for emotional support, and thwarted belongingness, respectively, as well as baseline social anxiety and depression symptoms.; Results: Greater insomnia symptom severity significantly predicted greater feelings of perceived burdensomeness following Cyberball participation, beyond baseline perceived burdensomeness, social anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms (Î²=â€¯.24, pâ€¯=â€¯.001). More severe insomnia symptoms also significantly predicted lower desire for emotional support after playing Cyberball, beyond baseline desire for emotional support and social anxiety symptoms (Î²=â€¯-.14, pâ€¯=â€¯.03) but not beyond baseline depression symptoms (Î²=â€¯-.16, pâ€¯=â€¯.07). Insomnia symptoms were not significantly associated with thwarted belongingness after Cyberball (Î²=â€¯-.05-.08, pâ€¯=â€¯.27-.57).; Limitations: Replication in larger samples and using other sleep disturbance indices is needed.; Conclusions: Findings suggest that individuals with more severe insomnia symptoms in the past two weeks experience greater perceptions of being a burden on others and less desire for emotional support in response to social exclusion.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

According to the interpersonal theory of suicide, thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB) may explain the link between sleep problems and suicide risk. This study examined these relationships among 331 community-dwelling adults identifying as sexual and/or gender minorities. Self-report measures of sleep problems, TB, PB, suicide risk, and anxiety were completed. Bootstrap mediation analyses were conducted to test TB and PB as interacting, individual, and parallel explanatory factors linking sleep problems and suicide risk. Sleep problems were associated with greater TB, PB, and suicide risk. TB and PB, in parallel and individually, accounted for the relationship between sleep problems and suicide risk, beyond age and anxiety. In contrast to the interpersonal theory, the indirect effect of PB was stronger at lower levels of TB and the indirect effect of TB was stronger at lower levels of PB.

264,Is Insomnia Lonely? Exploring Thwarted Belongingness as an Explanatory Link between Insomnia and Suicidal Ideation in a Sample of South Korean University Students,"Study Objectives: Suicide is a serious public health problem, and suicide rates are particularly high in South Korea. Insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation; however, little is known about the mechanisms accounting for this relationship in this population. Based on the premise that insomnia can be lonely (e.g., being awake when everyone else is asleep), the purpose of this study was to examine whether greater insomnia severity would be associated with higher levels of thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation, and whether thwarted belongingness would mediate the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation.; Methods: Predictions were tested in a sample of 552 South Korean young adults who completed self-report measures of insomnia severity, suicidal ideation, and thwarted belongingness.; Results: Greater insomnia symptom severity was significantly and positively associated with thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation. Mediation analyses revealed that thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the relationship between insomnia severity and suicidal ideation.; Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential importance of monitoring and therapeutically impacting insomnia and thwarted belongingness to help reduce suicide risk.; Â© 2016 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.Interpersonal Relations*, Suicidal Ideation*, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*psychology, Social Isolation/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Republic of Korea, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Students/psychology, Universities, Young Adult, South Korea*, insomnia*, interpersonal theory of suicide*, suicidal ideation*, thwarted belongingness*","Chu, Carol; Hom, Melanie A.; Rogers, Megan L.; Ringer, Fallon B.; Hames, Jennifer L.; Suh, Sooyeon & Joiner, Thomas E.",1,264
265,Insomnia and suicide-related behaviors: A multi-study investigation of thwarted belongingness as a distinct explanatory factor,"Background: Insomnia is a robust correlate of suicidal ideation and behavior. Preliminary research has identified thwarted belongingness (c.f. social disconnection) as an explanatory link between insomnia and suicidal ideation. Objectives: This study replicates and extends previous findings using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs in four demographically diverse samples. Additionally, the specificity of thwarted belongingness was evaluated by testing anxiety as a rival mediator. Method: Self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, thwarted belongingness, suicidal ideation and behavior, and anxiety were administered in four adult samples: 469 undergraduate students, 352 psychiatric outpatients, 858 firefighters, and 217 primary care patients. Results: More severe insomnia was associated with more severe thwarted belongingness and suicidality. Thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the association between insomnia and suicidality, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, beyond anxiety. Notably, findings supported the specificity of thwarted belongingness: anxiety did not significantly mediate the association between insomnia and suicidality, and insomnia did not mediate the relation between thwarted belongingness and suicidality. Limitations: This study relied solely on self-report measures. Future studies incorporating objective sleep measurements are needed. Conclusion: Findings underscore the utility of assessing and addressing sleep disturbances and social disconnection to reduce suicide risk.

266,Non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal thoughts and behaviors: A study of the explanatory roles of the interpersonal theory variables among military service members and veterans,"Objective: Research has identified non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) as a robust correlate of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; however, little is known regarding why these constructs may be related. Consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide, this study investigated thwarted belongingness (TB), perceived burdensomeness (PB), and capability for suicide (CS) as explanatory links in the association between NSSI, ideation, and suicide attempt history. Method: Military service members and veterans (N = 973; agemean = 29.9 years, 78.8% male, 63.8% Caucasian/White) completed measures of lifetime NSSI and suicide attempts; current suicidal ideation; TB, PB, and CS; and related psychiatric symptoms. Bootstrap moderated mediation analyses were employed to examine whether (a) TB moderated the mediating effect of PB on NSSI and ideation, (b) PB moderated the mediating effect of TB on NSSI and ideation, and (c) CS moderated the mediating effect of TB and PB on NSSI and attempts.

267,Routinized assessment of suicide risk in clinical practice: An empirically informed update,"Objective: Empirically informed suicide risk assessment frameworks are useful in guiding the evaluation and treatment of individuals presenting with suicidal symptoms. Joiner et al. (1999) formulated one such framework, which has provided a concise heuristic for the assessment of suicide risk. The purpose of this review is to ensure compatibility of this suicide risk assessment framework with the growing literature on suicide-related behaviors. Methods: This review integrates recent literature on suicide risk factors and clinical applications into the existing model. Further, we present a review of risk factors not previously included in the Joiner et al. (1999) framework, such as the interpersonal theory of suicide variables of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and capability for suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010) and acute symptoms of suicidality (i.e., agitation, irritability, weight loss, sleep disturbances, severe affective states, and social withdrawal). Results: These additional indicators of suicide risk further facilitate the classification of patients into standardized categories of suicide risk severity and the critical clinical decision making needed for the management of such risk. Conclusions: To increase the accessibility of empirically informed risk assessment protocols for suicide prevention and treatment, an updated suicide risk assessment form and decision tree are provided.

268,"Pathways among sleep onset latency, relationship functioning, and negative affect differentiate patients with suicide attempt history from patients with suicidal ideation","Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and poor relationship functioning often co-occur with the confluence of these factors contributing to greater suicide risk. This study investigated whether the pathways between depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and relationship functioning differentiated patients with suicide attempt history from those with suicidal ideation history. Patients seeking partial hospital treatment for severe psychiatric symptoms (N = 180) completed interviews assessing psychiatric and suicidal symptom histories, and self-report measures of sleep behaviors, anxiety, depression, and relationship functioning. Multiple sleep behaviors were examined: duration, sleep onset latency, and bedtime. Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation and moderated mediation analyses with suicide attempt as the moderator were used to evaluate pathways between variables. Among patients with ideation and attempt history, (1) sleep onset latency significantly mediated the association between depression and relationship functioning and that between anxiety and relationship functioning; (2) relationship functioning significantly mediated the association between depression and sleep onset latency and that between anxiety and sleep onset latency. These pathways were not significant among patients with suicidal ideation only. No other sleep behaviors were related to study variables. The reciprocal relationship between disrupted sleep onset latency and poor relationship functioning was specifically linked to more severe psychiatric symptoms among acute patients with suicide attempt histories","Chu, Carol; Nota, Jacob A.; Silverman, Alexandra L.; Beard, Courtney; Björgvinsson, Thröstur",1,268
269,The interactive effects of the capability for suicide and major depressive episodes on suicidal behavior in a military sample,"Major depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation and behavior. Suicide is fearsome; as such, the interpersonal theory of suicide proposes that individuals who engage in suicidal behavior possess not only the desire to die, but also the acquired capability (AC) for suicide. This study examined whether major depressive episodes (MDEs) may be particularly relevant to suicidal behavior when considered in the context of AC. History of MDEs, AC, and suicide attempt history were examined in a large (n = 3377) sample of military members. Data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression. Results indicated that among individuals with high AC, the number of MDEs was significantly, positively associated with number of previous suicide attempts; MDEs were not significantly related to suicide attempt history among individuals with low AC. Findings held in the presence of robust covariates associated with suicidal behavior. Findings suggest that a history of MDEs alone may not indicate severe suicide risk--increased AC for suicide appears necessary for increased suicide risk. Implications for suicide treatment and prevention in military personnel are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

270,Coping skills help explain how future-oriented adolescents accrue greater well-being over time,"Adolescents who endorse greater levels of future orientation report greater well-being over time, but we do not know the mechanism by which this happens. The present longitudinal study examined whether both adaptive as well as maladaptive coping strategies might explain how future orientation leads to ill-being and well-being over time in young New Zealanders. A sample of 1,774 preadolescents and early adolescents (51.9 % female) aged 10-15 years at Time 1 completed a self-report survey three times with 1 year intervals in between. Longitudinal mediation path models were constructed to determine whether and how maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies at Time 2 functioned as mediators between future orientation at Time 1 and ill-being and well-being at Time 3. Results showed that future orientation predicted lower maladaptive coping, which in turn predicted lower substance use and self-harming behavior. All three well-being outcomes (i.e., happiness with weight, vitality, and sleep) were consistently predicted by future orientation, and all three pathways were mediated by both lower maladaptive and higher adaptive coping strategies (with the exception of happiness with weight, which was mediated only by lower maladaptive coping). The results suggest that several pathways by which future orientation leads to greater well-being occurs through an increased use of adaptive coping, a decreased use of maladaptive coping, or both.

271,A rapid screening test for depression in junior high school children,"Background: Depression generates a remarkable disease burden. Early onset of depression in young people is associated with a poor prognosis. This has precipitated developing a screening instrument for early detection of depression in Taiwan adolescents.; Methods: We recruited 662 junior high school students who completed the Screening Test for Depression (STD) designed using diagnostic and statistical manual-IV diagnostic criteria of major depressive disorder for assessing depressive symptoms. The students were then interviewed by psychiatrists who used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Kid to verify the validity of the soon-to-be-developed Rapid STD (RSTD). Multiple logistic regression analysis of the STD results was used to extract items for the RSTD.; Results: We extracted four items for the RSTD: insomnia or hypersomnia"" ""recurrent thoughts of death or recurrent suicidal ideation"" ""feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt"" and ""psychomotor agitation or retardation"". Any two of the first three yielded the best-balanced algorithm for major depressive disorder which had a sensitivity of 75.0% specificity of 92.9% positive predictive value of 28.6% and negative predictive value of 99.0%. Any two of the four yielded the best-balanced algorithm for depressive disorders which had a sensitivity of 71.4% specificity of 92.0% the positive predictive value of 33.3% and the negative predictive value of 98.3%.; Conclusion: The RSTD a 4-item tool for junior high school children can be easily used to assess fluctuating risks of major depressive disorder and depressive disorders at any time.; Copyright Â© 2011.

Psychiatrists then used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Kid to interview these students to assess their suicidal ideation and psychiatric diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression with forward conditionals was used to find the risk factors for multivariate analysis.; Results: Female, age, depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, and poor sleep all contributed to adolescent suicidal ideation in univariate analysis. However, poor sleep became non-significant under the control of depressive disorder and adjustment disorder.; Discussion: We found that both depressive disorder and adjustment disorder play important roles in sleep and adolescent suicidal ideation.

273,Risk of first-generation H(1)-antihistamines: a GA(2)LEN position paper,"Background: First-generation H(1)-antihistamines obtained without prescription are the most frequent form of self-medication for allergic diseases, coughs and colds and insomnia even though they have potentially dangerous unwanted effects which are not recognized by the general public.; Aims: To increase consumer protection by bringing to the attention of regulatory authorities, physicians and the general public the potential dangers of the indiscriminate use first-generation H(1)-antihistamines purchased over-the counter in the absence of appropriate medical supervision.; Methods: A GA(2)LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network) task force assessed the unwanted side-effects and potential dangers of first-generation H1-antihistamines by reviewing the literature (Medline and Embase) and performing a media audit of US coverage from 1996 to 2008 of accidents and fatal adverse events in which these drugs were implicated.; Results: First-generation H(1)-antihistamines, all of which are sedating, are generally regarded as safe by laypersons and healthcare professionals because of their long-standing use. However, they reduce rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep, impair learning and reduce work efficiency. They are implicated in civil aviation, motor vehicle and boating accidents, deaths as a result of accidental or intentional overdosing in infants and young children and suicide in teenagers and adults. Some exhibit cardiotoxicity in overdose.; Conclusions: This review raises the issue of better consumer protection by recommending that older first-generation H(1)-antihistamines should no longer be available over-the-counter as prescription- free drugs for self-medication of allergic and other diseases now that newer second- generation nonsedating H(1)-antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios are widely available at competitive prices.;Histamine H1 Antagonists/*adverse effects, Nonprescription Drugs/*adverse effects, Brain/drug effects, Cognition/drug effects, Drug Approval/legislation & jurisprudence, Humans, Hypersensitivity/drug therapy, United States","Church, M K; Maurer, M; Simons, F E R; Bindslev-Jensen, C; van Cauwenberge, P; Bousquet, J; Holgate, S T & Zuberbier, T",0,273
274,Young people: Understanding the links between satisfaction with services and their health outcomes in primary care,"Comments on an article by A. A. Yassaee et al. (see record [rid]2017-13591-005[/rid]). Yassaee et al. report the findings from a large school-based cross-sectional survey of young people aged between 11 and 15 years in England in 2014. This was part of the larger international World Health Organization Health Behaviors of School-Aged Children study but included additional questions relevant to individual national health care services. The results reported in this article are based on four questions about patient experience in relation to the respondentâ€™s last GP visit (feeling respected, feeling at ease, satisfied with explanations, and feeling able to talk about personal things) and five questions about health concerns (headaches, sleep disturbance, low mood, self-harm, and overall health status). The study population was based on a random sample of school attenders in accordance with the overall study protocol and is therefore likely to be relatively representative of the general population. The authors found that approximately 80% of young people had consulted their GP within the previous 12 months and, of those who did, the majority reported a positive experience. While Yassaee et al. propose future population based surveys that include more variables to allow further understanding of the trends and associations identified, there is also an urgent need for in-depth exploration of the young person-clinician encounter.

275,The complex role of sleep in adolescent depression,"Unipolar depression is one of the most common disorders in adolescence, with point prevalence estimated at 3% to 8%, and episodes typically last 6 to 8 months. It has a chronic, episodic course marked by frequent recurrence and considerable impairment. An estimated 20% of adolescents will have had a depressive episode by age 18, with as many as 75% experiencing a second episode within 5 years. Depression is associated with substantial impairment in school, interpersonal relationships, and occupational adjustment; tobacco and substance abuse; suicide attempts; and a 30-fold increased risk of completed suicide. Given the unsatisfactory outcomes of conventional treatments for youth depression, various strategies are being pursued to improve outcomes (eg, improving the adherence-fidelity-duration of existing depression treatments; developing novel depression treatments; combining multiple depression-focused treatments--eg, antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]). Here, we describe the reason we are pursuing another strategy: we hypothesize that the concurrent treatment of depression and insomnia in depressed youth will improve both sleep and depression outcomes, even beyond the effects of traditional depression treatment. We next review the specific evidence pointing to the promise of this program of research. Our current work is focusing on youth insomnia rather than the broad span of all sleep disorder in youth (eg, delayed sleep phase syndrome [DSPS] and hypersomnia). Our rationale is 2-fold. This line of research is also motivated by the research priorities developed at the National Institutes of Health state-of-the-science conference on insomnia--that insomnia is not just a symptom or byproduct of depression but rather, in many patients, insomnia contributes to depression onset and/or maintenance, complicates and attenuates the effectiveness of depression treatment, and is the most common residual symptom when depression is incompletely remitted. In this discussion, we had 2 related goals. First, it is clear that insomnia is a significant problem in adolescence. Successful treatment of insomnia is an important goal in its own right. Overall, our approach is also consistent with the primary prevention of secondary disorders model advocated by several researchers in other clinical contexts and specifically in the case of insomnia and mood disorder.

276,Pediatric pharmacoepidemiology - safety and effectiveness of medicines for ADHD,"Introduction: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder in children and adolescents that comprises core symptoms of developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. Stimulant (methylphenidate, amphetamines) and non stimulant (atomoxetine, clonidine and guanfacine) are the treatment usually prescribed for ADHD. Area covered: This review covers the safety of ADHD medications in children and adolescents. MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched with the aim to retrieve prospective studies that monitored the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in children receiving drug therapy for ADHD. Many of the studies investigated the risk of specific AEs. In particular, the cardiovascular safety, the impact on growth and on sleep pattern, the risk of substance use disorders and of suicidal ideation are among the topics more studied. Expert opinion: Effective drugs for ADHD appears to be safe and well tolerated. Most of the adverse events reported in the randomised controlled trials are mild and transient. Decreased appetite, growth decrease and the impact on sleep (insomnia for stimulants and somnolence for alpha2-agonists) are among the most common events. Concerns exist about cardiovascular and psychiatric AEs, even if the available evidence does not support an association with medications.; Pharmacoepidemiology*, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy, Central Nervous System Stimulants/*administration & dosage, Adolescent, Central Nervous System Stimulants/adverse effects, Child, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology, Humans, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Amphetamines, atomoxetine, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug-related side effects and adverse reactions, methylphenidate, pediatrics","Clavenna, Antonio & Bonati, Maurizio",0,276
277,"Safety of flibanserin in women treated with antidepressants: A randomized, placebo-controlled study","Background: Depression is often associated with sexual dysfunction, and pharmacologic treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder can be considered in women receiving treatment for depression. Aim: To evaluate the safety of flibanserin in women treated for depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Methods: In this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, women with remitted or mild depression treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors who were not postmenopausal and were experiencing symptoms of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (ie, decreased sexual desire and related distress) received flibanserin 50 mg at bedtime (qhs) for 2 weeks and up-titrated to 100 mg qhs, flibanserin 100 mg qhs for the entire treatment period, or placebo for up to 12 weeks. Outcomes: Safety assessment included adverse events and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: 73 patients were randomly assigned to flibanserin (both dose groups combined) and 38 to placebo. The sponsor terminated the study early at discontinuation of the development of flibanserin. Treatment duration was at least 8 weeks for 84.9% and 94.7% of patients in the flibanserin and placebo groups, respectively. The most common adverse events (incidence â‰¥ 2% in the flibanserin group and higher than that in the placebo group) included dry mouth (5.5% for flibanserin vs 2.6% for placebo), insomnia (5.5% vs 2.6%), back pain (4.1% vs 2.6%), and dizziness (4.1% vs 0.0%). There were no serious adverse events and no instances of suicidal ideation or behavior. The proportions of patients with symptom worsening in the flibanserin and placebo groups, respectively, were 6.9% and 21.6% for depression and 1.4% and 2.7% for anxiety. Remission of depression at study end point, as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatologyâ€“Self Report, was experienced by 19.4% of flibanserin-treated patients and 10.8% of patients receiving placebo; remission of anxiety based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory was noted in 16.4% and 2.7% of patients, respectively. Clinical Implications: The results of this study support the safety of flibanserin in premenopausal women being treated with a serotonergic antidepressant. No increased risks were observed when adding flibanserin to a stable selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor treatment regimen. Strengths and Limitations: This was a well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The primary limitation was the early study discontinuation by the sponsor, which decreased the sample size and duration of treatment. Conclusion: In this small trial, flibanserin 100 mg qhs was generally safe and well tolerated in premenopausal women with mild or remitted depression taking a serotonergic antidepressant.

278,Suicide in panic disorder and depression,"Major depressive disorder is the most common diagnosis in patients who complete suicide. Researchers have attempted to identify factors predictive of suicidal risk in depressed patients. A principal source of information is the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Program on the Psychobiology of Depression. This 10-yr study, which included 954 patients with major affective disorder, found that panic attacks, severe psychic anxiety, global insomnia, moderate alcohol abuse, loss of pleasure or interest in life, and diminished concentration were predictive of suicide risk within the 1st yr after entry into the study. Hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and a previous suicide attempt were predictors of suicide after the 1st yr. Because of the particularly high risk of suicide associated with depression and symptoms of anxiety, the recognition and treatment of anxiety during the depressive episode is a particular challenge.

279,Self-harm in bipolar disorder: findings from a prospective clinical database,"Background: People with bipolar disorder may be at increased risk of suicidal behaviour but there are few prospective studies of self-harm in this group. Our aim was to describe the characteristics and outcome (in terms of repetition) for individuals with bipolar disorder who presented to hospital following self-harm.; Method: A nested case-control study was carried out using a large prospective self-harm database (1997-2010) in Manchester, UK. Characteristics of bipolar cases and non-bipolar controls were compared using conditional logistic regression, and outcomes were assessed via survival analyses.; Results: Bipolar cases (n=103) were more likely to repeat self-harm than controls (n=515): proportion with at least one repeat episode 58% vs. 25%, HR 3.08 (95% CI; 2.2-4.18). Previous self-harm, unemployment, contact with psychiatric services and sleep disturbance were all more common in cases than controls. Even after adjustment for known risk factors, the risk of repetition remained higher in the bipolar group (adjusted HR 1.68; 95% CI; 1.10-2.56).; Limitations: The study covers cases from hospital sites in Manchester, UK, and therefore only includes self-harm that was serious enough to present at hospital emergency departments.; Conclusion: People with bipolar disorder who self-harm have a higher risk of repetition than people who self-harm more generally.

280,Atypical antipsychotic medication poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management,"The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected acute ingestions of atypical antipsychotic medications by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of an atypical antipsychotic medication might be evaluated, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of atypical antipsychotic medication ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of atypical antipsychotic medications alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or the recipient of a potentially malicious administration of an atypical antipsychotic medication should be referred to an emergency department immediately. This activity should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) Patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation, including determination of the precise dose ingested, presence of signs or symptoms of toxicity, history of other medical conditions, and the presence of co-ingestants (Grade C). 3) Asymptomatic patients without evidence of attempted self-harm are unlikely to develop symptoms if the interval between the ingestion and the call is greater than 6 hours. These patients do not need referral and should receive follow-up based on local poison center protocols (Grade C). 4) All patients less than 12 years of age who are naÃ¯ve to atypical antipsychotic medications and are experiencing no more than mild drowsiness (lightly sedated and can be aroused with speaking voice or light touch) can be observed at home unless they have ingested more than four times the initial adult dose for the implicated antipsychotic medication or a dose that is equal to or more than the lowest reported acute dose that resulted in at least moderate toxicity, whichever dose is smaller (i.e., aripiprazole 15 mg, clozapine 50 mg, olanzapine 10 mg, quetiapine 100 mg, risperidone 1 mg, ziprasidone 80 mg) (Grade D). 5) All patients 12 years of age or older who are naÃ¯ve to atypical antipsychotic medications and are experiencing no more than mild drowsiness can be observed at home unless they have ingested more than five times the initial adult dose for the implicated antipsychotic medication (i.e., aripiprazole 50 mg, clozapine 62.5 mg, olanzapine 25 mg, quetiapine 125 mg, risperidone 5 mg, ziprasidone 100 mg) (Grade D). 6) Patients who use atypical antipsychotic medications on a chronic basis can be observed at home unless they have acutely ingested more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of the implicated antipsychotic medication (Grade C). 7) Patients who have ingested less than a threshold dose (see Recommendations 4-6) and are exhibiting no more than mild drowsiness can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center if symptoms develop or worsen. If mild drowsiness is present at the time of the initial call, the poison center should make follow-up calls until at least 6 hours after ingestion. Consideration should be given to the time of day that home observation will take place. Observation during normal sleep hours might not be reliable. Depending on local poison center policy, patients could be referred to an emergency department if the observation would take place during normal sleeping hours of the patient or caretaker (Grade D). 8) Any patient already experiencing any signs or symptoms, other than mild drowsiness, thought to be related to atypical antipsychotic medication toxicity should be transported to an emergency department. Transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 9) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 10) There are no specific data to suggest benefit from out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal in patients exposed to atypical antipsychotic medications. Poison centers should follow local protocols and experience with the out-of-hospital use of activated charcoal in this context. Do not delay transportation in order to administer charcoal (Grade D). 11) For patients who merit evaluation in an emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be implemented given reports of conduction disturbances associated with this class of medications. Provide usual supportive care en route to the hospital, including airway management and intravenous fluids for hypotension (Grade D). 12) Depending on the specific circumstances, follow-up calls should be made to determine outcome at appropriate intervals based on the clinical judgment of the poison center staff (Grade D).;Evidence-Based Medicine*, Ambulatory Care/*standards, Antipsychotic Agents/*poisoning, Poison Control Centers/*standards, Poisoning/*therapy, Humans, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Triage","Cobaugh, Daniel J; Erdman, Andrew R; Booze, Lisa L; Scharman, Elizabeth J; Christianson, Gwenn; Manoguerra, Anthony S; Caravati, E Martin; Chyka, Peter A; Woolf, Alan D; Nelson, Lewis S & Troutman, William G",0,280

Efficacy was assessed as a secondary objective using the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV), the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and the CGI-Severity (CGI-S) scale.; Results: Of 314 participants enrolled, 191 completed the study. TEAEs were reported in 89.8% of participants, led to discontinuation in 12.4%, and were reported as serious in 8.9%. TEAEs that were reported by â‰¥5% of participants and considered by investigators as related to LDX were decreased appetite (49.4%), weight decrease (18.2%), insomnia (13.1%), initial insomnia (8.9%), irritability (8.6%), nausea (6.7%), headache (5.7%), and tic (5.1%). The median time to first onset and duration, respectively, of TEAEs of special interest were as follows: decreased appetite, 13.5 and 169.0Â days; weight decrease, 29.0 and 225.0Â days; insomnia, 17.0 and 42.8Â days; and headache, 22.0 and 2.0Â days. Reports of decreased appetite, weight decrease, insomnia, and headache were highest in the first 4-12Â weeks. Psychiatric TEAEs were infrequent: psychosis and mania (nÂ =Â 1), suicidal events (suicidal ideation, nÂ =Â 2; suicide attempt, nÂ =Â 1), and aggression events (aggression, nÂ =Â 14; anger, nÂ =Â 2; hostility, nÂ =Â 1). At the last on-treatment assessment (LOTA), mean increases from baseline in vital signs were as follows: pulse rate, 7.0Â bpm (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.7-8.2); systolic blood pressure (SBP), 3.4Â mmHgÂ (95% CI 2.2-4.5); and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 3.2Â mmHg (95% CI 2.2-4.2). Pre-defined thresholds for a potentially clinically important (PCI) high pulse rate were met at one or more visits by 22 participants (7.0%), for PCI high SBP were met by 45 children (22.4%) and 17 adolescents (15.2%), and for PCI high DBP were met by 78 children (38.8%) and 24 adolescents (21.4%). The mean QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) decreased from baseline to LOTA (-0.6Â ms [95% CI -2.3 to 1.2]; range -50 to +53). Mean changes in growth from baseline to LOTA were weight, 2.1Â kg (95% CI 1.5-2.8); height, 6.1Â cm (95% CI 5.6-6.7); and body mass index (BMI), -0.5Â kg/m2 (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3). There was a general shift to lower z score categories for height, weight, and BMI from baseline to LOTA. The mean change in ADHD-RS-IV from baseline to LOTA was -25.8 (95% CI -27.0 to -24.5) for total score, -12.6 (95% CI -13.4 to -11.9) for the hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale score, and -13.1 (95% CI -13.8 to -12.4) for the inattention subscale score. At LOTA, 77.9% of participants had a CGI-I score of 1 or 2. In addition, 77.3 and 69.2% of participants were classified as treatment responders, based on a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 and a â‰¥30% or â‰¥50% reduction from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total score, respectively.; Conclusions: The safety profile of LDX in this longer-term study was similar to that reported in previous studies. The efficacy of LDX was maintained throughout the 2-year study period.

282,Sleep patterns predictive of daytime challenging behavior in individuals with lowfunctioning autism,"Increased severity of problematic daytime behavior has been associated with poorer sleep quality in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. In this work, we investigate whether this relationship holds in a real-time setting, such that an individualâ€™s prior sleep can be used to predict their subsequent daytime behavior. We analyzed an extensive real-world dataset containing over 20,000 nightly sleep observations matched to subsequent challenging daytime behaviors (aggression, self-injury, tantrums, property destruction and a challenging behavior index) across 67 individuals with low-functioning autism living in two U.S. residential facilities. Using support vector machine classifiers, a statistically significant predictive relationship was found in 81% of individuals studied (P < 0.05). For all five behaviors examined, prediction accuracy increased up to approximately eight nights of prior sleep used to make the prediction, indicating that the behavioral effects of sleep may manifest on extended timescales. Accurate prediction was most strongly driven by sleep variability measures, highlighting the importance of regular sleep patterns. Our findings constitute an initial step towards the development of a real-time monitoring tool to pre-empt behavioral episodes and guide prophylactic treatment for individuals with autism.

283,DEPRESSION--A FELLOW TRAVELER WITH SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder that occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, immunologic abnormalities being a prominent feature of the disease. Psychiatric disorders frequently coexist, depression being the most common mood disorder in neuropsychiatric lupus. This literature review was performed through searching MEDLINE database for full-text English-language articles--original research, systematic review and updates published in the last five years (2010-2015), using the keywords depression and systemic lupus erythematosus"". The main outcomes identified were prevalence and predictors of depression in various cultural and ethnic groups depression-related clinical issues (suicidal ideation cognitive impairment altered body image sleep and sexual disturbances influence of SLE treatment) and influence on quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach that takes into account the polymorphism and individual variability of the SLE clinical manifestations helps to improve early detection of depression which is responsible for the increased risk of comorbidities suicidal attempts decreased treatment adherence and impaired quality of life.

284,Rating scale item assessment of self-harm in postpartum women: A cross-sectional analysis,"We examined the utility of screening instruments to identify risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) in a population of women with neuropsychiatric illnesses at high risk for postpartum depression. Pregnant women with neuropsychiatric illness enrolled prior to 20 weeks of gestation. Follow-up visits at 4â€“8-week intervals through 13 weeks postpartum included assessment of depressive symptoms with both clinician and self-rated scales. A total of 842 women were included in the study. Up to 22.3% of postpartum women admitted SI on rating scales, despite the majority (79%) receiving active pharmacological treatment for psychiatric illness. Postpartum women admitting self-harm/SI were more likely to meet criteria for current major depressive episode (MDE), less than college education, an unplanned pregnancy, a history of past suicide attempt, and a higher score on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. In women with a history of neuropsychiatric illness, over 20% admitted SI during the postpartum period despite ongoing psychiatric treatment. Patient-rated depression scales are more sensitive screening tools than a clinician-rated depression scale for +SI in the postpartum period.

285,Risk factors for suicide among older adults with cancer,"Objective: To determine whether the increased risk of suicide for individuals with cancer may be explained by functional limitations, lack of social support, or other factors. Method: In this population-based case-control study, interviews of primary informants for suicides in the state of North Carolina were compared to interviews with participants in the Piedmont Health Study of the Elderly to estimate adjusted odds ratios for suicide and self-reported, physician diagnosed cancer, heart attack, stroke, and hip fracture. Results: Adjusting for all other factors, there was a statistically significant association of suicide and cancer (odds ratio [OR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 1.84-3.73), but not heart attack, hip fracture, or stroke. The risk of suicide was also elevated for men vs. women (OR 17.15, CI 10.88-27.02), whites vs. blacks (OR 9.70, CI 6.07-15.50), and individuals with stressful life events (OR 2.75, CI 1.97-3.86) or limitations of instrumental (OR 2.93, CI 2.03-4.22) but not physical activities of daily living. Suicide cases were not more likely to be short of breath or poor sleep quality. Suicide was statistically significantly less likely for study participants who were married with spouse living vs. other (OR 0.61, CI 0.43-0.88) or who had one or more indicators of social support (OR 0.27, CI 0.19-0.39). Conclusion: After adjustment for other risk factors, suicide was strongly associated with cancer but not with other disabling, potentially fatal conditions.

286,"Factors associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic and hypnotic use over 17 years in a national cohort","Background: In the general population, most individuals with mental disorders are not treated with psychotropic medications. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with psychotropic medication use over a 17 year period in a birth cohort. Method: Members of the 1946 British birth cohort (n = 2928 in 1999) reported psychotropic medication use in 1982 at age 36, in 1989 at age 43, and in 1999 at age 53. At each of the three time points, several factors were investigated for their association with antidepressant, anxiolytic or hypnotic medication use. Results: After adjusting for severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, clinical factors such as suicidal ideation, sleep difficulty and poor physical health were strongly associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic or hypnotic medication use in 1982 and 1989, but not in 1999. Non-clinical factors were infrequently associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic or hypnotic medication use in 1982 and 1989 after adjusting for severity of symptoms, however several non-clinical factors were associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic or hypnotic medication use in 1999 including being female (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.9), unemployment (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 2.1, 4.1), living alone (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.7, 3.9), and being divorced, separated or widowed (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.3). Limitations: Data were not available on help-seeking behaviour. Conclusions: Treatment of mental disorder with psychotropic medications is strongly associated with clinical factors. However, non-clinical factors continue to be significant, and may influence both treatment-seeking and prescribing behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

287,Psychiatric Adverse Effects Of Interferon Therapy,"A number of data support the involvement of immunological mechanisms in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. The nervous and immune systems are physiologically integrated and influence each other's functioning. Clinical studies have reported a larger number of psychiatric symptoms consecutive to immunomodulating interferon therapy. The most frequent are depression, suicidal behavior, manic syndrome, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders and delirium associated with an array of unspecific psychiatric symptoms: fatigue, irritability, psycho-motor retardation, decreased libido, insomnia, concentration difficulties and attention deficit. Another undesired consequence of interferon therapy is the worsening of a preexistent psychiatric disorder. Thus, a history of psychiatric disorder is currently one of the contraindications of interferon therapy. Psychiatric adverse events may occur either shortly after the initiation of therapy, or as a result of ongoing treatment, but most adverse events occur after 3 weeks of treatment. Although there are relatively few studies on statistically significant patient samples, current data underline the importance of managing these effects and also the most indicated treatment strategies. Therefore, an improved psychiatric management of these adverse effects may change the gastroenterologist's decision to exclude from treatment high - risk patient categories such as those with mood disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, or other addiction.; depression, interferon, neurotoxicity","Coman, Horia George; HerÅ£a, Dana-Cristina & NemeÅŸ, Bogdan",0,287
288,The treatment of bipolar depression,"Background: The treatment of bipolar depression represents a relatively understudied area in clinical psychiatry. The depressive phases of bipolar disorder can be very disabling, with significant associated comorbidity and suicide risk, impairment in functioning, and infringement on quality of life. We review the current evidence for the management of bipolar depression.; Method: References for this review were obtained through MEDLINE searches of the medical literature on subjects pertaining to the treatment of bipolar depression. Search terms included bipolar depression, antidepressants, and bipolar disorder. Only publications in English are reviewed here.; Results: Lithium is currently the gold standard and most appropriate initial treatment for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Other mood stabilizers have demonstrated preliminary efficacy. Of the antidepressants, bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be associated with less risk of inducing hypomania, mania, and rapid cycling compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be considered for patients with anergic bipolar depression. Electroconvulsive therapy has been shown to be highly efficacious. Other treatment modalities, including psychotherapy, sleep deprivation, phototherapy, and newer medications, require further research.; Conclusions: Although the treatment of bipolar depression can be a complicated clinical task, the treatment armamentarium is expanding. Further research, especially in the form of randomized controlled trials, is warranted. Clinicians should be familiar with general guidelines for the use of psychopharmacologic agents for treating bipolar depression.;Bipolar Disorder/*therapy, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy, Bipolar Disorder/psychology, Bupropion/therapeutic use, Combined Modality Therapy, Electroconvulsive Therapy, Humans, Lithium/therapeutic use, Phototherapy, Psychotherapy, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Sleep Deprivation, Treatment Outcome","Compton, M T & Nemeroff, C B",0,288
289,"Symptom profiles of DSM-IV defined remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence of depression: The role of the core symptoms","Background: Depression outcomes in research and clinical practice are commonly defined by the concepts of remission, recovery, relapse, and recurrence. Despite their widespread use, there has been little empirical examination of these concepts. Therefore, we investigated profiles of individual symptoms during each of these phases of depression. Methods: In a 3-year prospective study of 267 depressed primary care patients, we established the presence or absence of the individual DSM-IV depressive symptoms week-by-week during DSM-IV-defined remissions, recoveries, relapses, and recurrences. We measured symptoms in 12 quarterly assessments using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Remissions were characterized by double the proportion of time that the core symptoms were present compared to the initial phase of recoveries after a major depressive episode (MDE; 59 versus 32%; Z = âˆ’3.03; P = .002). Before a relapse, remissions again showed elevated levels of core symptoms in comparison to the final phase of recoveries before a recurrence (58 versus 26%; Z = âˆ’2.99; P = .003). Conclusions: Compared with the initial and final phases of recoveries, remissions showed a consistently higher level of core symptoms. Clinically, this means that unresolved core symptoms in the direct aftermath of a MDE seem to constitute a risk for relapse and should be the target of preventive or augmented interventions.

290,Novel Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Predict Suicidal Ideation and Psychiatric Symptoms in a Text-Based Mental Health Intervention in Madrid,"Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning were used to predict suicidal ideation and heightened psychiatric symptoms among adults recently discharged from psychiatric inpatient or emergency room settings in Madrid, Spain. Participants responded to structured mental and physical health instruments at multiple follow-up points. Outcome variables of interest were suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Predictor variables included structured items (e.g., relating to sleep and well-being) and responses to one unstructured question, how do you feel today?"" We compared NLP-based models using the unstructured question with logistic regression prediction models using structured data. The PPV sensitivity and specificity for NLP-based models of suicidal ideation were 0.610.56 and 0.57 respectively compared to 0.730.76 and 0.62 of structured data-based models.

291,Utility of the Fitbit Flex to evaluate sleep in major depressive disorder: A comparison against polysomnography and wrist-worn actigraphy,"Background: Sleep disturbance is a common and important component of affective illness. Fitness activity trackers are emerging as alternative means to estimate sleep in psychiatric patients; however, their ability to quantify sleep in mood disorders has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, this study sought to evaluate the utility of the Fitbit Flex (FBF) to estimate sleep in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) relative to gold standard polysomnography (PSG) and a widely-used actigraph (Actiwatch-2; AW-2).; Methods: Twenty-one patients with unipolar MDD wore the FBF and AW-2 during in-laboratory PSG. Bland-Altman analysis compared sleep variables among devices. Epoch-by-epoch analysis further evaluated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the FBF and AW-2 relative to PSG.; Results: The FBF demonstrated significant limitations in quantifying sleep and wake, relative to PSG. In the normal setting, the FBF significantly overestimated sleep time and efficiency, and displayed poor ability to correctly identify wake epochs (i.e. low specificity). In the sensitive setting, the FBF significantly underestimated sleep time and efficiency relative to PSG. Performance characteristics of the FBF were more similar to the AW-2 in the normal compared to sensitive setting.; Limitations: Participants were young to middle aged and predominantly female, which may limit generalizability of findings. Study design also precluded ability to assess longitudinal performance of FBF.; Conclusions: The FBF is not an adequate substitute for PSG when quantifying sleep in MDD, and the settings of the device sizably impact its performance relative to PSG and other standard actigraphs. The limitations and capabilities of the FBF should be carefully considered prior to clinical and research implementation.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

292,Identifying suicidal ideation in general medical patients,"Objectives: To describe characteristics of general medical patients with suicidal ideation and to develop an efficient clinical strategy for identifying these patients.; Design: Cross-sectional analysis of data without intervention.; Setting: A representative sample of community respondents interviewed as part of the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area surveys.; Subjects: A total of 6041 individuals who reported receiving care in general medical settings in the 6 months preceding the baseline interview.; Main Outcome Measure: Suicidal ideation within the year preceding the baseline interview.; Results: A total of 154 patients (2.6%) had experienced suicidal thoughts within the previous year. In multivariate analyses, the following sociodemographic factors were significantly associated with having suicidal ideation: being white (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; P < .001) relative to African American, separated or divorced (OR, 1.8; P = .03) relative to married, and aged 18 to 30 years (OR, 2.3; P = .02) or aged 31 to 50 years (OR, 2.1; P = .03) relative to those older than 65 years. Gender, educational level, and socioeconomic status were not statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Psychiatric disorders significantly associated with suicidal ideation were major depression (OR, 10.3; P < .001), panic disorder (OR, 5.2; P < .001), alcohol disorder (OR, 2.0; P = .04), and phobic disorder (OR, 1.6; P = .02) within the previous year. However, only 34% of respondents with suicidal ideation met criteria for major depression. With the aid of stepwise logistic regression, a four-item screening questionnaire, the Suicidal Ideation Screening Questionnaire, was developed to predict patients with suicidal ideation. Likelihood ratios for suicidal ideation increased from 0.21 to 32.8 with more positive responses to questions concerning symptoms of hopelessness, guilt, depressed mood, and sleep disturbances.; Conclusions: If the results from the four-item screen are reproduced in a clinical setting, general medical patients with a high likelihood for suicidal ideation may be identified with a brief screening questionnaire. This screen would have greater sensitivity than would be achieved by assessing suicidal ideation only in those patients who meet criteria for a distinct psychiatric disorder.;Family Practice/*statistics & numerical data, Mental Disorders/*diagnosis, Suicide/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Likelihood Functions, Logistic Models, Male, Mental Disorders/epidemiology, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Socioeconomic Factors, Suicide/statistics & numerical data","Cooper-Patrick, L; Crum, R M & Ford, D E",1,292
293,Nocturnal growth hormone secretion studies in adolescents with or without major depression re-examined: Integration of adult clinical follow-up data,"34 depressed and 43 control adolescents (mean age 14.4 yrs) were followed-up in young adulthood. Blood samples had been collected for growth hormone (GH) every 20 min during the 24-hr period coinciding with the 3rd consecutive night of sleep EEG. Ss were blindly reinterviewed at follow-up using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (lifetime version). The original adolescent nocturnal GH data were analyzed in light of the information obtained regarding clinical course into adulthood. A substantial proportion of the controls developed at least one episode of major depression or dysthymia during follow-up. Latent depressive Ss exhibited a significantly more rapid increase of adolescent nocturnal GH secretion following sleep onset than controls. Of the Ss with at least one lifetime major depressive episode during follow-up, the subgroup who would go on to make suicide attempts secreted significantly more GH during the 1st 4 hrs of sleep. Adults with lifetime depression exhibited significantly reduced levels of GH in the 100 min preceding sleep onset during adolescence. Sleep-related GH secretion has predictive value for future depressive episodes and suicide attempts, and dysfunction of complex sleep-onset mechanisms may be a premorbid marker.

Moreover, low-grade immune activation and dopaminergic overstimulation, which are consequences of T. gondii infection, could alter sleep patterns and duration.Methods: Sleep data on 833 Amish participants [mean age (SD) = 44.28 (16.99) years; 59.06% women] were obtained via self-reported questionnaires that assessed sleep problems, duration and timing. T. gondii IgG was measured with ELISA. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regressions and linear mixed models, with adjustment for age, sex and family structure.Results: T. gondii seropositives reported less sleep problems (p < 0.005) and less daytime problems due to poor sleep (p < 0.005). Higher T. gondii titers were associated with longer sleep duration (p < 0.05), earlier bedtime (p< 0.005) earlier mid-sleep time (p < 0.05).Conclusions: It seems unlikely that sleep mediates the previously reported associations between T. gondii and mental illness.

295,How to improve the risk-benefit ratio of antidepressants,"Suggests that to improve the risk associated with present antidepressant drugs, it is necessary to choose drugs that are selective and well tolerated in overdose, to look for contraindications, to adapt the dose progressively, to inform and supervise patients adequately, and to deal with risks due to the main pharmacological effects (anxiety, nervousness, sleep disturbances, suicide). With new drugs, risk improvement will probably be the result of greater selectivity. Optimal dosages, duration of treatment, co-medication, strategies for nonresponders and for compliance, decreases in the onset of action, and targeting of patients may help improve the efficacy of present antidepressant drugs.

Patients who received quetiapine for at least 4 weeks and who were not concurrently treated with another antipsychotic or mood stabilizer were included. Improvement was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), with response determined by ratings of much improved"" or ""very much improved."" Data were collected from May 15 2003 through November 30 2003.; Results: Of 857 records reviewed 20 patients (16 male 4 female) (mean +/- SD age = 12.1 +/- 6.7 years; range 5-28 years) received a quetiapine trial (mean +/- SD dosage = 248.7 +/- 198.4 mg/day; range 25-600 mg/day) over a mean duration of 59.8 +/- 55.1 weeks (range 4-180 weeks). Eight (40%) of 20 patients were judged ""responders"" to quetiapine; the mean CGI-I score for the entire group was 3.0 +/- 1.1 (minimally improved). A statistically significant improvement (p = .002) was found between a mean pretrial CGI-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score of 5.1 +/- 0.6 (markedly ill) and a posttrial CGI-S score of 4.2 +/- 1.1 (moderately ill). Adverse effects occurred in 50% (N = 10) of patients and led to drug discontinuation in 15% (N = 3) of patients.; Conclusion: Quetiapine was modestly effective for maladaptive behavior in patients with a PDD.

297,Practitioner review: Current best practice in the management of adverse events during treatment with ADHD medications in children and adolescents,"Background: Medication is an important element of therapeutic strategies for ADHD. While medications for ADHD are generally wellâ€tolerated, there are common, although less severe, as well as rare but severe adverse events AEs during treatment with ADHD drugs. The aim of this review is to provide evidenceâ€ and expertâ€based guidance concerning the management of (AEs) with medications for ADHD. Methods: For ease of use by practitioners and clinicians, the article is organized in a simple question and answer format regarding the prevalence and management of the most common AEs. Answers were based on empirical evidence from studies (preferably metaâ€analyses or systematic reviews) retrieved in PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge through 30 June 2012. When no empirical evidence was available, expert consensus of the members of the European ADHD Guidelines Group is provided. The evidenceâ€level of the management recommendations was based on the SIGN grading system. Results: The review covers monitoring and management strategies of loss of appetite and growth delay, cardiovascular risks, sleep disturbance, tics, substance misuse/abuse, seizures, suicidal thoughts/behaviours and psychotic symptoms. Conclusion: Most AEs during treatment with drugs for ADHD are manageable and most of the times it is not necessary to stop medication, so that patients with ADHD may continue to benefit from the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment.

298,Depression in young people A growing challenge for primary care,"Background: Recent research indicates that 27% of young people aged 18-24 have a mental health problem involving mood, anxiety, personality and/or substance abuse disorders and 15-40% report depressive symptomatology. A proportion of these young people will suicide. The morbidity associated with depressive illness in this age group is high, with those experiencing a depressive episode having reduced vocational and life prospects and being highly vulnerable to further episodes in later life.; Objective: To outline the clinical features of depression in young people and to provide strategies for appropriate management.; Discussion: Presentation of depression in young people is likely to vary from accepted diagnostic criteria with non specific symptoms such as boredom, anxiety, failing adjustment and sleep disturbance predominating. Management includes attending to key social problems, ensuring a safe environment and counselling, which may be supportive counselling or more specific treatments of cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy. Medication is indicated for more severe depression or with failure of response to psychological strategies. Early case identification and intensive treatment of first episodes of depression is important in reducing prevalence, cost and morbidity.;Psychotherapy*, Depression/*therapy, Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Depression/complications, Depression/diagnosis, Humans, Prevalence, Suicide","Cosgrave, E; McGorry, P; Allen, N & Jackson, H",0,298
299,Time Course and Predictors of Suicidal Ideation During Citalopram Treatment in the STAR*D Trial,"Objective: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), but their impact on suicidal ideation is equivocal. Our goal is to examine the time course and clinical predictors of citalopram-induced suicidal ideation during phase 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial.; Methods: Of the 4,041 subjects with DSM-IV nonpsychotic MDD in the STAR*D trial phase 1 (2001-2006), we included in our analysis 3,577 subjects who reported side-effect data and had received citalopram (20-60 mg/d) for 8-14 weeks. Suicidal ideation was reported on item 12 of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to assess baseline characteristics associated with emergence and worsening of suicidal ideation.; Results: Suicidal ideation was more likely to occur early in citalopram treatment, with few subjects showing emergence or worsening occurring after 6 weeks of treatment. Clinical variables explained very little of the variance in worsening or emergence of suicidal ideation with citalopram treatment (generalized RÂ² â‰¤ 2% in survival analysis). Being Hispanic, taking sedative medications, increased depression severity, absence of hypersomnia, and cardiac comorbidity were significantly (P â‰¤ .04) associated with greater likelihood of emergence of suicidal ideation in patients without suicidal ideation at baseline. Being widowed, better work performance, weight loss at baseline, and the presence of vascular or neurologic comorbidities were associated with a greater likelihood of worsening of suicidal ideation.; Conclusions: Baseline clinical variables were poor predictors of emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation. As such, increased research focusing on clinical correlates rather than clinical predictors of suicidal ideation may be useful, as intervening events may be crucial in bringing about increased suicidality.; Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00021528.; Â© Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Suicidal Ideation*, Citalopram/*adverse effects, Citalopram/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Adult, Disease Progression, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical data, Psychometrics/statistics & numerical data, Risk Factors, Time Factors","Coughlin, Catherine G.; Jakubovski, Ewgeni & Bloch, Michael H.",1,299
300,Nineteen and Up study (19Up): understanding pathways to mental health disorders in young Australian twins,"Purpose: The Nineteen and Up study (19Up) assessed a range of mental health and behavioural problems and associated risk factors in a genetically informative Australian cohort of young adult twins and their non-twin siblings. As such, 19Up enables detailed investigation of genetic and environmental pathways to mental illness and substance misuse within the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Sample (BLTS).; Participants: Twins and their non-twin siblings from Queensland, Australia; mostly from European ancestry. Data were collected between 2009 and 2016 on 2773 participants (age range 18-38, 57.8% female, 372 complete monozygotic pairs, 493 dizygotic pairs, 640 non-twin siblings, 403 singleton twins).; Findings To Date: A structured clinical assessment (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) was used to collect lifetime prevalence of diagnostic statistical manual (4th edition) (DSM-IV) diagnoses of major depressive disorder, (hypo)mania, social anxiety, cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, panic disorder and psychotic symptoms. Here, we further describe the comorbidities and ages of onset for these mental disorders. Notably, two-thirds of the sample reported one or more lifetime mental disorder.In addition, the 19Up study assessed general health, drug use, work activity, education level, personality, migraine/headaches, suicidal thoughts, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology, sleep-wake patterns, romantic preferences, friendships, familial environment, stress, anorexia and bulimia as well as baldness, acne, asthma, endometriosis, joint flexibility and internet use.The overlap with previous waves of the BLTS means that 84% of the 19Up participants are genotyped, 36% imaged using multimodal MRI and most have been assessed for psychological symptoms at up to four time points. Furthermore, IQ is available for 57%, parental report of ADHD symptomatology for 100% and electroencephalography for 30%.; Future Plans: The 19Up study complements a phenotypically rich, longitudinal collection of environmental and psychological risk factors. Future publications will explore hypotheses related to disease onset and development across the waves of the cohort.

301,Volatile Chemistry: Children And Antidepressants,"The article discusses about the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on patients suffering with obsessive compulsive disorder. SSRIs have been viewed as lifesaving and have been widely prescribed for depression, experts face an unsettling possibility that in a small number of young people, some of these drugs may trigger suicidal thinking or behavior. Recently released clinical trial data, moreover, reveal flaws in the evidence that SSRIs ease depression in children and adolescents. In contrast, many psychiatric researchers credit SSRIs for a drop in youth suicides in the last decade. Companies that make SSRIs and the doctors who prescribe them are now on the defensive. Prozac was the first SSRI to hit the market, in 1988. Child psychiatrists began prescribing it. Researchers have sought a biological explanation for the adverse effects in children, but so far with little success. SSRIs boost serotonin levels, but how this affects the developing brain isn't well understood. Serotonin facilitates nerve signal transmission, modulating mood, sleep, appetite, and a variety of brain functions. Depression may occur when too little serotonin is available in nerve synapses. In April 2004, a set of experts commissioned to advise the U.K. government found that four of five SSRIs were unlikely to benefit children.

302,Sleep Disturbance in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Epiphenomenon or Causal Factor?,"Purpose Of Review: The goal of this review is to integrate recent findings on sleep disturbance and PTSD, examine sleep disturbance as a causal factor in the development of PTSD, and identify future directions for research, treatment, and prevention.; Recent Findings: Recent research highlights a relationship between both objective and subjective sleep disturbance and PTSD across diverse samples. Sleep disturbance also predicts PTSD over time. Finally, treatments targeting sleep disturbance lead to decreased PTSD symptoms, while standard PTSD treatments conclude with residual sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance may be more than a mere epiphenomenon of PTSD. Future research examining the causal role of sleep disturbance in the development of PTSD, as well as the utility of targeting sleep disturbance in prevention and treatment, is necessary to fully understand the likely bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbance and PTSD.; Sleep Wake Disorders*/epidemiology, Sleep Wake Disorders*/psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic*/epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic*/physiopathology, Causality, Humans, Psychopathology, Insomnia, PTSD, Posttraumatic stress disorder, Sleep, Trauma","Cox, Rebecca C.; Tuck, Breanna M. & Olatunji, Bunmi O.",0,302
303,Differences in well-being between sexual minority and heterosexual college students,"This study examines differences in well-being between sexual minority and heterosexual college students and identifies factors associated with well-being among sexual minority college students. A secondary analysis of cross-sectional web-based survey data was conducted. Using propensity score matching, 43 sexual minority students were matched to 43 heterosexual students on age, race, sex, and year in school. Sexual minorities had significantly lower well-being scores compared to heterosexual college students. Among sexual minorities, physical activity, depression, thoughts of suicide, and sleep quality were all predictive of well-being. Understanding issues related to well-being among sexual minorities is important and strategies need to be developed to improve well-being.

304,The health status of adults on the autism spectrum,"Compared to the general pediatric population, children with autism have higher rates of co-occurring medical and psychiatric illnesses, yet very little is known about the general health status of adults with autism. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of psychiatric and medical conditions among a large, diverse, insured population of adults with autism in the United States. Participants were adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California enrolled from 2008 to 2012. Autism spectrum disorder cases (N = 1507) were adults with autism spectrum disorder diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modification codes 299.0, 299.8, 299.9) recorded in medical records on at least two separate occasions. Controls (N = 15,070) were adults without any autism spectrum disorder diagnoses sampled at a 10:1 ratio and frequency matched to cases on sex and age. Adults with autism had significantly increased rates of all major psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and suicide attempts. Nearly all medical conditions were significantly more common in adults with autism, including immune conditions, gastrointestinal and sleep disorders, seizure, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Rarer conditions, such as stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, were also significantly more common among adults with autism. Future research is needed to understand the social, healthcare access, and biological factors underlying these observations.

305,Noteworthy briefs from the field,"This brief presents current research related to psychiatry. In the first study, the role of anticholinergic burden in non-degenerative mild cognitive impairment is examined. In the second study, led by Dan J. Stein, MD, PhD, chair in the department of psychiatry at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, found selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be first-line agents in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD. In the third study, Tammie Giles, MD, at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, and colleagues, performed a literature search and studied randomized trials comparing nocturnal CPAP with controls or oral appliances in adults with OSA (an apnea and hypopnea index > 5/hour) in trials that had a minimum intervention period of 2 weeks. And in the fourth study, a 3-year experimental program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, which recently completed its first year, offers a model for identifying and treating homebound elderly patients who are depressed or suicidal.

306,Suicidality and antidepressants in the elderly,"Suicide has reached epidemic proportions in the elderly, particularly in non-Hispanic white men. Unfortunately, the risk is underappreciated in this population. Known risk correlates for suicide in this population fall into three interrelated categories. Sociologic factors include such considerations as living alone and having few social interactions. Physical health factors include having more medical comorbidity and being a current smoker. The mental health risk factors include the presence of mood and anxiety disorders with a focus on the greater severity of symptoms, especially hypersomnia, hopelessness, and a history of suicide attempts. Suicide is a spectrum comprising ideation, intent, and plan. Clinical depression is never a normal part of aging and warrants aggressive treatment. Recent warnings linking antidepressants and suicide may have special relevance in the elderly. Based on preliminary studies with antipsychotic drugs, a subgroup of patients who experience akathisia may be particularly vulnerable to suicide. Upon initiation of antidepressants, it is recommended that adults be seen in follow-up three times within the first 12 weeks of treatment; if medically indicated, the first contact should be during the first week.; ","Crumpacker, David W.",0,306

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of sleep disturbances and insomnia on depression and suicidality in a nontreatment seeking sample of college students. Results indicated that insomnia and nightmares were significant predictors of symptoms of depression, while only nightmares significantly predicted suicidal ideation. Further analysis indicated that participants with elevated scores on insomnia, nightmares, or both experienced differing levels of depression and suicidal ideation. Future directions and treatment implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

309,The moderation of an early intervention program for anxiety and depression by specific psychological symptoms,"The current study examined the influence of a number of psychological factors on the effectiveness of an early intervention program targeting anxiety and depression in a non-clinical sample of college students. The early intervention program comprised elements of the cognitive-behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (McCullough, 2000) delivered in a 2-hour computer-based educational program. Participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, and general distress prior to the intervention program and then again 8 weeks later. Additionally, participants were assessed for past major depression, sleep related difficulties, a number of anxiety disorders, and suicide ideation. Moderation of the effectiveness of the early intervention program by these factors depended on the dependent variable of interest, specifically: the effectiveness of the intervention program on symptoms of depression was moderated by insomnia; symptoms of anxiety by past post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobia as well as sleep problems related to nightmares; and symptoms of general negative affect by social phobia and suicide ideation. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

310,Assessing prescribing practices of clozapine before and after the implementation of an updated risk evaluation and mitigation strategy,"Introduction: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication approved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and suicidal behavior in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. Despite its therapeutic efficacy, clozapine is associated with several adverse effects, including agranulocytosis. In late 2015, the Food and Drug Administration updated the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for clozapine with new requirements for monitoring, prescribing, and dispensing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clozapine prescribing practices at a Kentucky state psychiatric hospital before and after the implementation of the updated REMS program.; Methods: The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate clozapine prescribing practices by identifying the number of patients on clozapine therapy in the 6 months pre and post updated REMS implementation. Included in the study were patients at a Kentucky state psychiatric hospital on clozapine therapy for the 24 months before the updated REMS implementation and in the 6-month study period after the implementation. The secondary objective of this study examined psychiatrist comfort level of prescribing clozapine.; Results: Since the implementation of the updated REMS program, there has been an increased percentage of patients that were prescribed clozapine at a Kentucky state psychiatric hospital. This increase was not statistically significant (Pâ€‰=â€‰.2610).; Discussion: The prescribing practices of clozapine within this facility did not differ significantly comparing pre- and post-REMS change in terms of number of patients prescribed clozapine, patient's dose, and therapy duration. Data from this study contributes to the body of knowledge evaluating this new standard of practice under the updated REMS.; Kentucky, REMS, clozapine, prescribing practices, state psychiatric hospital","Curry, Brent; Palmer, Emma; Mounce, Crystal; Smith, Gilbert & Shah, Vital",0,310
311,Treatment of subjective total insomnia after suicide attempt with olanzapine and electroconvulsive therapy,"Presents case report of a 64-year-old man was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit after suicide attempt by opiate overdose causing a short period of respiratory depression and hypoxia. Thorough physical examination, medical history, and laboratory studies were unrevealing except for chronic insomnia disorder. The patient demonstrated excellent response to a combination of olanzapine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as monitored by psychiatric evaluation, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), polysomnography (PSG), and 6-month follow-up interview. Regardless of proposed mechanism, cases exhibiting features of subjective insomnia may benefit from a multidimensional approach in treating both primary sleep disturbance and its comorbid disorders, with the previously illustrated treatments considered in more resistant cases.

312,The health and well-being of Australia's future medical doctors: protocol for a 5-year observational cohort study of medical trainees,"Introduction: Clinical training in the undergraduate medical course places multiple stressors on trainees, which have been held to lead to heightened distress, depression, suicide, substance misuse/abuse and poor mental health outcomes. To date, evidence for morbidity in trainees is largely derived from cross-sectional survey-based research. This limits the accuracy of estimates and the extent to which predispositional vulnerabilities (biological and/or psychological), contextual triggers and longer-term consequences can be validly identified. Longitudinal clinical assessments embedded within a biopsychosocial framework are needed before effective preventative and treatment strategies can be put in place.; Methods and Analysis: This study is an observational longitudinal cohort study of 330 students enrolled in the undergraduate medicine course at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney, Australia. Students will be recruited in their fourth year of study and undergo annual assessments for 4 consecutive years as they progress through increasingly demanding clinical training, including internship. Assessments will include clinical interviews for psychiatric morbidity, and self-report questionnaires to obtain health, psychosocial, performance and functioning information. Objective measures of cognitive performance, sleep/activity patterns as well as autonomic and immune function (via peripheral blood samples) will be obtained. These data will be used to determine the prevalence, incidence and severity of mental disorder, elucidate contextual and biological triggers and mechanisms underpinning psychopathology and examine the impact of psychopathology on performance and professional functioning.; Ethics and Dissemination: Ethics approval has been granted by the UNSW human research ethics committee (reference HC16340). The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and distributed to key stakeholders within the medical education sector. The outcomes will also inform targeted preventative and treatment strategies to enhance stress resilience in trainee doctors.; Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

313,Cyproheptadine for prevention of neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz: A randomized clinical trial,"Cyproheptadine prevention of the neuropsychiatric adverse effects of an antiretroviral regimen including efavirenz has been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Twenty-five patients (16 males and 9 females with mean Â± SD ages of 36 Â± 9 years) in a cyproheptadine group, and 26 patients (17 males and 9 females with mean Â± SD ages of 34 Â± 7 years) in a control group completed the trial. Sexual contact and injection drug use were the main routs of HIV infection in both groups. The patientsâ€™ neuropsychiatric adverse effects were evaluated based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation, and Somatization Subscale of Symptom Checklist 90 at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment. Cyproheptadine significantly decreased the scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation of the patients after 4 weeks in comparison with control group. All of the scores increased in control group following antiretroviral therapy. Although short duration of the patientsâ€™ follow-up was a major limitation of the study, the results of the study showed that cyprohepradine is effective in prevention of depression, anxiety, hallucination, aggressive behaviors, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, poor impulse control, active social avoidance, suicidal ideation, and improved sleep quality of HIV-positive patients after initiation of antiretroviral therapy including efavirenz.

314,"Sleep duration, mental health, and substance use among rural adolescents: Developmental correlates","Numerous studies have demonstrated that most adolescents do not get adequate amounts of sleep. Furthermore, insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk for depression and suicide attempts as well as substance abuse in adolescence. However, extant studies have relied primarily on national samples or suburban adolescents, with a paucity of research examining the associations between sleep duration and mental health and substance abuse risk in rural adolescents. Additionally, these associations rarely have been examined within a developmental context. The present study attempted to address these gaps by using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to examine the associations between sleep duration and risk factors in the lower and upper grade levels for high school students attending schools in rural areas. YRBS data were obtained from 2 rural school districts located in the Appalachian region of North Carolina (n = 987). For the full sample, approximately 40% of students reported receiving 6 or fewer hours of sleep on a typical school night. High school students in the lower grades (9th and 10th) who reported short sleep duration were more likely to have endorsed each of the mental health, suicidal behavior, and substance use items. Significant differences emerged between sleep groups on suicide attempts and alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use for students in the upper grade levels. We conclude that short sleep duration is problematic in rural high school students, especially for those students recently transitioning from middle school to high school. These findings can inform identification, prevention, and intervention strategies to encourage and promote healthy sleep habits among rural adolescents.

315,The emergence of devastating impulse control disorders during dopamine agonist therapy of the Restless Legs Syndrome,"Introduction: The Restless Legs Syndrome is a common sensorimotor disorder, typically amenable to treatment with dopamine agonist therapy. Dopamine agonists have been associated with emergent impulse control disorders (ICDs) when used in patients with Parkinson disease, and ICDs have now been reported in individuals with RLS on dopamine agonist therapy. Our aim was to characterize cases of emergent ICDs in Australian patients with focus on the dopamine agonists implicated and the social significance of ICDs. Method: A series of RLS patients on dopamine agonist therapy were identified with ICDs over a 2-year period. Additional cases of ICDs were found using a mailout questionnaire designed to capture those with high impulsivity. These patients were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Version 11, and a modified Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview. Case records and medication schedules were evaluated. Results: Twelve cases of patients with de novo ICDs were found with a range of impulsive behaviors including pathological gambling, kleptomania, compulsive shopping, and hypersexuality. Criminality, suicidality, and marital discord also were featured. These occurred over a wide range of latencies and l-dopa exposures. Discussion: This group of Australian RLS patients with ICDs display high levels of impulsivity and is the first to use the BIS-11 questionnaire in this setting. Impulse control disorders can occur over a wide range of dopamine agonist therapy types and dose exposures. Impulse control disorder tendencies may persist, despite withdrawal of dopamine agonists. The emergence of ICDs needs careful consideration in light of their potentially devastating financial, social, and marital consequences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

316,Paroxetine in panic disorder: clinical management and long-term follow-up,"Panic disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders and has a lifetime prevalence of 3-5%. Panic attacks can begin at any age, but commonly have their onset in early adulthood between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Naturalistic data has shown that panic disorder has a chronic and relapsing course. Panic disorder is reported to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses such as depression and substance abuse. Currently, recommended treatment modalities for panic disorder include the use of antidepressant pharmacotherapy and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. Paroxetine is unique among the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors since, in addition to its effect on the CNS serotonergic neurotransmission, it also has mild noradrenergic properties demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression. Paroxetine treatment has the potential to cause weight gain and sexual dysfunction, primarily anorgasmia and ejaculatory dysfunction for the long term. In the short-term, treatment causes nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, irritability, headaches and eating and sleeping difficulties. Paroxetine is an example of an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor agent, which has been well studied in the treatment of panic disorder and is efficacious and well-tolerated.

317,A rhesus monkey model of self-injury: effects of relocation stress on behavior and neuroendocrine function,"Background: Self-injurious behavior (SIB), a disorder that afflicts many individuals within both clinical and nonclinical populations, has been linked to states of heightened stress and arousal. However, there are no published longitudinal data on the relationship between increases in stress and changes in the incidence of SIB. This study investigated the short- and long-term behavioral and neuroendocrine responses of SIB and control monkeys to the stress of relocation.; Methods: Twenty adult male rhesus macaques were exposed to the stress of relocation to a new housing arrangement in a newly constructed facility. Daytime behavior, sleep, and multiple measures of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis function were investigated before and after the move.; Results: Relocation induced a complex pattern of short- and long-term effects in the animals. The SIB animals showed a long-lasting increase in self-biting behavior, as well as evidence of sleep disturbance. Both groups exhibited elevated cortisol levels in saliva, serum, and hair, and also an unexpected delayed increase in circulating concentrations of corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG).; Conclusions: Our results indicate that relocation is a significant stressor for rhesus macaques and that this stressor triggers an increase in self-biting behavior as well as sleep disturbance in monkeys previously identified as suffering from SIB. These findings suggest that life stresses may similarly exacerbate SIB in humans with this disorder. The HPA axis results underscore the potential role of CBG in regulating long-term neuroendocrine responses to major stressors.; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*metabolism, Locomotion/*physiology, Pituitary-Adrenal System/*metabolism, Self-Injurious Behavior/*etiology, Self-Injurious Behavior/*metabolism, Stress, Psychological/*complications, Analysis of Variance, Animals, Behavior, Animal, Disease Models, Animal, Hair/metabolism, Hydrocortisone/metabolism, Macaca mulatta, Male, Saliva/metabolism, Self-Injurious Behavior/psychology, Stress, Psychological/etiology, Time Factors, Transcortin/metabolism","Davenport, Matthew D.; Lutz, Corrine K.; Tiefenbacher, Stefan; Novak, Melinda A. & Meyer, Jerrold S.",0,317
318,"The impact of exercise on suicide risk: examining pathways through depression, PTSD, and sleep in an inpatient sample of veterans","Suicide has a large public health impact. Although effective interventions exist, the many people at risk for suicide cannot access these interventions. Exercise interventions hold promise in terms of reducing suicide because of their ease of implementation. While exercise reduces depression, and reductions in depressive symptoms are linked to reduced suicidal ideation, no studies have directly linked exercise and suicide risk. The current study examined this association, including potential mediators (i.e., sleep disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and depression), in a sample of Veterans. SEM analyses revealed that exercise was directly and indirectly associated with suicide risk. Additionally, exercise was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and better sleep patterns, each of which was, in turn, related to lower suicide risk.;Depression/*psychology, Exercise/*psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology, Suicide/*prevention & control, Veterans/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Depression/complications, Female, Humans, Inpatients/psychology, Male, Middle Aged, Risk, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/complications, Suicidal Ideation, Suicide/psychology, Suicide, Attempted/psychology","Davidson, Collin L; Babson, Kimberly A; Bonn-Miller, Marcel O; Souter, Tasha & Vannoy, Steven",1,318
319,A systematic review of the nature and correlates of sleep disturbance in early psychosis,"Sleep disturbances are common in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and have been associated with increased symptom severity, neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life. Despite a significant body of literature in this field, there has been limited investigation of sleep disturbance in the early course of the illness. This systematic review aims to synthesise and evaluate the available data exploring sleep in early psychosis, with two key research questions: 1) What is the nature of sleep disturbance in early psychosis? and 2) What are the correlates of sleep disturbance in early psychosis? From an initial search, 16,675 papers were identified, of which 21 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The preliminary evidence suggests that self-reported sleep disturbances are prevalent in early psychosis and may be associated with symptom severity, as well as elevated rates of both help-seeking and suicidality. Abnormalities in sleep architecture and sleep spindles are also commonly observed and may correlate with symptom severity and neurocognitive deficits. However, due to significant methodological limitations and considerable heterogeneity across studies, evidence to support the reliability of these associations is limited. We outline a research agenda, emphasising the prospective use of gold-standard sleep measurement to investigate the prevalence and nature of sleep disturbances in early psychosis, as well as how these may be related to the onset and persistence of psychotic symptoms.

320,Targeting the Noradrenergic System in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prazosin Trials,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder that may develop after exposure to a life-threatening trauma. As veterans and armed forces may deal with diverse health problems compared with civilians, they have a greater risk for psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, than civilians, even if the disorder may be also frequent in the general population. PTSD is associated with significant comorbidity, especially with mood disorders and substance abuse. Moreover, the suicide risk is higher in PTSD patients than in the general population. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are commonly employed in the management of PTSD, but often these treatments fail or are discontinued due to adverse effects. It has been demonstrated that high noradrenergic activity may be associated with hyperarousal, trauma nightmares and sleep disturbances in PTSD subjects, probably through the stimulation of Î± -1 adrenergic receptors in the brain prefrontal cortex. The Î± -1 adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin decreases noradrenaline effects at brain Î±-1 adrenoreceptors and may be a promising agent in the treatment of PTSD, as some studies have found it effective and well tolerated. Therefore, the present review is aimed to examine the role of noradrenergic system in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Moreover, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of prazosin in PTSD patients. Meta-analysis was used to combine data from multiple studies and better estimate the effect of prazosin on specific outcomes. We found prazosin to be significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing distressing dreams in PTSD patients, even though our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies included in our quantitative synthesis.; Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Norepinephrine/*metabolism, Prazosin/*therapeutic use, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*drug therapy, Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosage, Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists/adverse effects, Humans, Neuroimaging, Prazosin/administration & dosage, Prazosin/adverse effects, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sleep Wake Disorders/metabolism, Sleep Wake Disorders/prevention & control, Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/metabolism, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology, Treatment Outcome","De Berardis, Domenico; Marini, Stefano; Serroni, Nicola; Iasevoli, Felice; Tomasetti, Carmine; de Bartolomeis, Andrea; Mazza, Monica; Tempesta, Daniela; Valchera, Alessandro; Fornaro, Michele; Pompili, Maurizio; Sepede, Gianna; Vellante, Federica; Orsolini, Laura; Martinotti, Giovanni & Di Giannantonio, Massimo",0,320
321,Long-term relief of intractable hiccups with vagal nerve stimulation,"This article presents the case of a 59-year-old woman who was referred in 2008 with a 3-year history of unexplained singultus. The hiccupping frequency had progressively increased to 20 per minute. She had accompanying insomnia, wasting, and exhaustion. Given the severity and impact of her symptoms, she actively considered suicide. She had unsuccessfully trialed several medications including amitriptyline, baclofen, gabapentin, haloperidol, metoclopramide, domperidone and pantoprazole. Her medical history included a pre-existent depression. This case demonstrates that left-sided vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can induce complete long-term relief of medically refractory singultus. VNS may modulate afferent, central or efferent pathways of the hiccup reflex. Although this is a single case and correct patient blinding is very difficult with VNS, the fact that all three episodes of hiccups recurrence occurred during VNS off argues against a placebo effect.When evaluating a patient for possible VNS therapy, we propose obtaining a respiratory muscle EMG, a polysomnography and a psychiatric assessment to rule out psychogenic singultus. Our results as well as other's suggest that successful vagal nerve blockade may predict VNS benefit. The acute mood deterioration upon battery depletion could be entirely reactive to recurrence of hiccups, although a direct antidepressant effect of VNS cannot be excluded.

322,Physical conditions and challenging behaviour in people with intellectual disability: A systematic review,"Background: Challenging behaviour is a major problem among people with intellectual disabilities. Physical factors may be an important cause. The aim of the present systematic review was to determine the physical conditions associated with challenging behaviour. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane systematic review database for empirical studies published between 1990 and 2008. The quality of all the studies that met the inclusion criteria was assessed using the SIGN-50 methodology checklists. Results: The search identified 45 studies, which looked at general medical conditions, motor impairment, epilepsy, sensory impairment, gastrointestinal disease, sleep disorders, dementia and others. There were four high-quality observational studies, seven well-conducted observational studies, 21 observational studies of low methodological quality and 13 non-analytical studies. There were significant and independent associations between challenging behaviours and urinary incontinence, pain related to cerebral palsy and chronic sleep problems, and between self-injurious behaviour and visual impairment. No association was found with hearing impairment, bowel incontinence, mobility impairment or epilepsy. Many other physical conditions were not addressed at all. Conclusion: Medical conditions can play a role in challenging behaviour, and this should be evaluated in the clinical setting. So far, the level of evidence is generally low, and longitudinal studies are completely lacking. We recommend a systematic approach to research examining the role of physical conditions in challenging behaviour, the ultimate aim being to establish a basis for the development of clinical guidelines.

323,"Insomnia disorder in adolescence: Diagnosis, impact, and treatment","Insomnia disorder is very common in adolescents; it is particularly manifest in older adolescents and girls, with a prevalence comparable to that of other major psychiatric disorders (e.g., depressive disorders). However, insomnia disorder in adolescence is poorly characterized, under-recognized, under-diagnosed, and under-treated, and the reason for the female preponderance for insomnia that emerges after puberty is largely unknown. Insomnia disorder goes beyond an individual complaint of poor sleep or a sleep state misperception, and there is emerging evidence supporting the association of insomnia symptoms in adolescents with alterations in several bio-systems including functional cortical alterations and systemic inflammation. Insomnia disorder is associated with depression and other psychiatric disorders, and is an independent risk factor for suicidality and substance use in adolescents, raising the possibility that treating insomnia symptoms in early adolescence may reduce risk for these adverse outcomes. Cognitive behavioral treatments have proven efficacy for adolescent insomnia and online methods seem to offer promising cost-effective options. Current evidence indicates that insomnia in adolescence is an independent entity that warrants attention as a public health concern in its own right.

324,"Traumatic brain injury, sleep quality, and suicidal ideation in Iraq/Afghanistan era veterans","The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep quality mediates the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) history and current suicidal ideation. Measures of TBI history, sleep quality, and suicidal ideation were administered to 130 Iraq/Afghanistan veterans. As expected, sleep quality mediated the effect of TBI history on current suicidal ideation (indirect effect, 0.0082; 95% confidence interval, 0.0019â€“0.0196), such that history of TBI was associated with worse sleep quality, which was, in turn, associated with increased suicidal ideation. These findings highlight the importance of assessing TBI history and sleep quality during suicide risk assessments for veterans.

325,Predicting Suicide Risk in Trauma Exposed Veterans: The Role of Health Promoting Behaviors,"Introduction: Returning veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan experience high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation is among the strongest risk factors for completed suicide. Some research suggests an association between PTSD and suicidal ideation, and that health-promoting behaviors-behaviors that sustain or increase well-being-play a role in this association. The current study examined whether health-promoting behaviors moderate the association between PTSD severity and suicidal ideation.; Methods: Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF; N = 108) completed measures of PTSD symptoms, trauma exposure, suicidal ideation, and health-promoting behaviors.; Results: Moderated regression was used to test the hypothesis. Results indicated that health promoting behaviors, Î² = -.06, p = .001, and PTSD symptoms, Î² = .36, p < .001, were significantly related to suicidal ideation. Consistent with our main hypothesis, the health promoting behaviors x PTSD interaction term was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, Î² = -.09, p = .001. The overall model accounted for 13% of the variance in suicidal ideation. Among individuals with high PTSD symptom severity, those who engaged in more health promoting behaviors reported less suicidal ideation than those who engaged in fewer health promoting behaviors.; Conclusions: Health-promoting behaviors could be important for reducing suicidal ideation among veterans with high levels of PTSD symptoms. It is recommended that future research examine health promotion interventions as a means of reducing suicidal ideation.; Health Promotion*, Suicidal Ideation*, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*diagnosis, Adult, Afghan Campaign 2001-, Female, Health Behavior, Humans, Iraq War, 2003-2011, Male, Regression Analysis, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/pathology, Veterans","DeBeer, Bryann B.; Kittel, Julie A.; Cook, Andrew; Davidson, Dena; Kimbrel, Nathan A.; Meyer, Eric C.; Gulliver, Suzy B. & Morissette, Sandra B.",1,325
326,Use of adjunctive stimulants in adult bipolar depression,"Bipolar depression represents a high priority research field, due to its pervasiveness, and high economic and personal (suicidality, impaired function, quality of life) costs, and the limited evidence base to inform therapeutics. Mood stabilizers and second-generation antipsychotics for bipolar depression are commonly only partially effective, and their side-effects may overlap with depressive symptoms such as hypersomnia, daytime drowsiness, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and weight gain. Moreover, the use of antidepressants in bipolar depression is controversial due to concerns regarding the risks of inefficacy or switching to mood elevation. Stimulants and related compounds such as modafinil and armodafinil have on occasion been used as adjuncts in bipolar depressed patients with encouraging results, but their use is limited by the paucity of systematic evidence of efficacy and safety. The present review aims to provide an updated perspective on the use of stimulants and stimulant-like medications in adult bipolar depression, considering not only recent randomized controlled trials, but also open naturalistic studies, in order to clarify the strengths and limitations of using these agents.

327,Bridging the gap between education and appropriate use of benzodiazepines in psychiatric clinical practice,"More than half a century after their discovery, benzodiazepines (BDZs) still represent one of the largest and most widely prescribed groups of psychotropic compounds, not only in clinical psychiatry but also in the entire medical field. Over the last two decades, however, there has been an increased focus on the development of antidepressants and antipsychotics on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and researchers, with a reduced interest in BDZs, in spite of their widespread clinical use. As a consequence, many psychiatric residents, medical students, nurses, and other mental health professionals might receive poor academic teaching and training regarding these agents, and have the false impression that BDZs represent an outdated chapter in clinical psychopharmacology. However, recent advances in the field, including findings concerning epidemiology, addiction risk, and drug interactions, as well as the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition with related diagnostic changes, strongly encourage an updated appraisal of the use of BDZs in clinical practice. During a recent thematic event convened with the aim of approaching this topic in a critical manner, a group of young Italian psychiatrists attempted to highlight possible flaws in current teaching pathways, identify the main clinical pros and cons regarding current use of BDZs in clinical practice, and provide an updated overview of their use across specific clinical areas and patient populations.

328,Augmentative dopaminergic interventions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression: A focus on dopamine agonists and stimulants,"Bipolar depression is the most difficult-to-treat phase of bipolar disorder, in relation to its significant disruption of every-day life functioning and high suicidality risk. Despite the availability of several treatment options, the management of bipolar depression is still particularly challenging, with limited approved therapies. Mood stabilizers and second-generation antipsychotics may not be as effective in ameliorating depressive compared to mood elevation symptoms, and entail substantial somatic tolerability limitations. In contrast, antidepressants are widely used off-label in bipolar depression (perhaps in part due to their better somatic tolerability), but such use is controversial, as they may be associated with a higher risk of manlc/hypomanic switch and rapid cycling. Among pharmacological augmentation strategies, compounds with pro-dopaminergic activity such as stimulants and stimulant-like agents (e.g., methylphenidate, modafinil and armodafinil) and dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole and ropinirole), have shown potential antidepressant effects, even though their use in clinical practice is still limited by the paucity of systematic evidence of efficacy and safety. The present review sought to summarize available evidence about such augmentative dopaminergic interventions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression, considering results of recent randomized controlled trials, as well as open studies, systematic reviews and guidelines indications.

329,Using Neural Networks with Routine Health Records to Identify Suicide Risk: Feasibility Study,"Background: Each year, approximately 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide, accounting for 1-2 in every 100 deaths. It is always a tragic event with a huge impact on family, friends, the community and health professionals. Unfortunately, suicide prevention and the development of risk assessment tools have been hindered by the complexity of the underlying mechanisms and the dynamic nature of a person's motivation and intent. Many of those who die by suicide had contact with health services in the preceding year but identifying those most at risk remains a challenge.; Objective: To explore the feasibility of using artificial neural networks with routinely collected electronic health records to support the identification of those at high risk of suicide when in contact with health services.; Methods: Using the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank UK, we extracted the data of those who died by suicide between 2001 and 2015 and paired controls. Looking at primary (general practice) and secondary (hospital admissions) electronic health records, we built a binary feature vector coding the presence of risk factors at different times prior to death. Risk factors included: general practice contact and hospital admission; diagnosis of mental health issues; injury and poisoning; substance misuse; maltreatment; sleep disorders; and the prescription of opiates and psychotropics. Basic artificial neural networks were trained to differentiate between the suicide cases and paired controls. We interpreted the output score as the estimated suicide risk. System performance was assessed with 10x10-fold repeated cross-validation, and its behavior was studied by representing the distribution of estimated risk across the cases and controls, and the distribution of factors across estimated risks.; Results: We extracted a total of 2604 suicide cases and 20 paired controls per case. Our best system attained a mean error rate of 26.78% (SD 1.46; 64.57% of sensitivity and 81.86% of specificity). While the distribution of controls was concentrated around estimated risks < 0.5, cases were almost uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Prescription of psychotropics, depression and anxiety, and self-harm increased the estimated risk by ~0.4. At least 95% of those presenting these factors were identified as suicide cases.; Conclusions: Despite the simplicity of the implemented system, the proposed methodology obtained an accuracy like other published methods based on specialized questionnaire generated data. Most of the errors came from the heterogeneity of patterns shown by suicide cases, some of which were identical to those of the paired controls. Prescription of psychotropics, depression and anxiety, and self-harm were strongly linked with higher estimated risk scores, followed by hospital admission and long-term drug and alcohol misuse. Other risk factors like sleep disorders and maltreatment had more complex effects.; Â©Marcos DelPozo-Banos, Ann John, Nicolai Petkov, Damon Mark Berridge, Kate Southern, Keith LLoyd, Caroline Jones, Sarah Spencer, Carlos Manuel Travieso.

Control group consisted of 33 healthy voluntary participants without any known psychiatric disorders. Patients and volunteers who participated in the study were assessed with the Inventory of Statements About Self-injury (ISAS), Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia severity index (ISI), and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).; Results: In our study, PSQI scores, DERS total scores and DEBQ emotional eating subscores were significantly higher in the CSA victims (In orderly; pÂ =Â 0,034, pÂ <Â 0.001, pÂ =Â 0,023). 55.7% of the CSA victims reported self-injurious behavior, while 15.5% of healthy voluntary participants reporting self-injurious behavior. The CSA victims reporting NSSI had higher DERS scores than CSA victims without NSSI. (pÂ =Â 0.024). The CSA victims with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and CSA victims without PTSD had a positive correlation between DEBQ emotional eating subscores and DERS total scores (In orderly: rÂ =Â 0.762, pÂ =Â 0.031; rÂ =Â 0.872, pÂ <Â 0.001).

331,Curiosity improves coping efficacy and reduces suicidal ideation severity among military veterans at risk for suicide,"Curiosity, the tendency to engage in novel and challenging opportunities, may be an important source of resilience for those at risk for suicide. We hypothesized that curiosity would have a buffering effect against risk conferred by multiple sources of distress, whereby curiosity would be associated with reduced suicidal ideation and increased coping efficacy. As part of a larger intervention trial designed to improve coping skills and reduce suicidal ideation, 117 military veterans with suicidal ideation completed measures of curiosity and distress (perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances) at baseline, and completed measures of suicidal ideation and coping efficacy (to stop negative thoughts, to enlist support from friends and family) at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-week follow up. Growth curve models showed that curiosity moderated the association between distress and suicidal ideation at baseline and that curiosity moderated the association between distress and increased coping efficacy to stop negative thoughts over time. Findings suggest that curiosity may buffer against the effect of heightened levels of distress on suicidal ideation and help facilitate stronger gains in coping efficacy over time. Additional work should further examine the role of curiosity as a protective factor for veterans with suicidal ideation.

332,Borderline personality disorder traits and suicide risk: The mediating role of insomnia and nightmares,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with high rates of suicide risk and problems related to sleep, including insomnia and nightmares. The purpose of the current study was to assess the potential indirect effect of BPD traits on suicide risk through both/either insomnia and nightmares.; Methods: Participants (Nâ€¯=â€¯281) were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to complete the study remotely online. Participants completed measures of BPD traits and symptoms, suicide risk (history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors), insomnia symptoms, and distress and impairment related to nightmares.; Results: BPD traits and symptoms were moderately to highly correlated to suicide risk, insomnia, and nightmares. In parallel mediation models, BPD traits had a significant indirect effect on suicide risk through insomnia symptoms but not nightmares.; Limitations: The current study assessed problems within the general population and not in a clinical sample. Second, the study relied solely on self-report measures. Futures studies would benefit from investigating these relations in clinical samples utilizing observer-report and interview methods.; Conclusions: BPD traits appear to relate to increased risk for suicide through the relation with sleep concerns, particularly insomnia symptoms. Therefore, assessing and treating sleep problems within individuals with BPD may result in a lower risk for suicide.; Copyright Â© 2018.

333,Clinical significance of psychotic experiences in the context of sleep disturbance or substance use,"Background: Psychotic experiences (PE) are commonly reported in the general population, where they are associated with elevated clinical need and functional impairment. Research studies typically exclude PE that occur in the context of sleep or substance use (PE-SS), based on the assumption that they are normative within these contexts. This is the first study to formally test clinical and functional outcomes associated with PE that occur in the context of sleep or substance use. Method: Data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (n = 11 776) were used to assess the associations between both PE and PE-SS and a broad range of outcomes, including psychiatric co-morbidity, suicidal behavior, mental health treatment utilization and World Health Organization (WHO) domains of function, using logistic regression analyses. Lifetime PE and PE-SS were mutually exclusive categories, assessed using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview psychosis screen. Results: PE were associated with all 10 clinical and functional outcomes. Similarly, respondents reporting PE-SS had greater clinical need and impaired function relative to controls, which was significant for seven of the 10 outcome variables. When directly compared, the PE and PE-SS groups differed only in their associations with role function (greater impairment for PE) and self-care (greater impairment for PE-SS). Conclusions: PE-SS were associated with a broad range of clinical and functional outcomes in this large general population sample. These associations were similar to those found for PE. Future studies should investigate relative differences between sleep- and substance-induced PE.

334,Design of a treatment pathway for insomnia in prison settings in England: a modified Delphi study,"Objective: Insomnia is highly prevalent in prisoners and is a risk factor for poor mental well-being, depression, suicidality and aggression, all common concerns in this vulnerable population. Improving sleep management options in prison offers the potential to impact positively on a number of these common risk factors. The study aim was to design a treatment pathway for insomnia in prisons informed by stakeholders with professional or lived experience of insomnia and prison-based interventions.; Design: A modified Delphi technique, adapted to the stakeholder (either receiving controlled feedback online or face to face on a series of statements), was used over three rounds to gain consensus on a final treatment pathway design.; Participants: Academic sleep researchers, prison staff and prisoners were invited to develop the treatment pathway.; Results: Fifteen stakeholders took part in round 1 and thirteen in round 2. There were six statements of contention that comprised concerns over the inclusion of sleep observations, sleep restriction therapy and promethazine. Consensus was high (>80%). Thirteen stakeholders agreed the final pathway in round 3. The final treatment pathway comprised a standardised stepped-care approach for insomnia in prison populations. The pathway resulted in five main stages: (1) transition from community; (2) detection and assessment; (3) treatment for short-term insomnia; (4) treatment for long-term insomnia and (5) transition from prison to community or another establishment.; Conclusions: The treatment pathway is designed to promote early detection of insomnia, potentially reducing unnecessary prescriptions and medication trading, misuse and diversion in the prison setting. It should make a substantial difference in reducing the large number of sleep complaints and positively impact on prisoners, staff and the prison environment. Specifically, improving sleep should have a positive impact on prisoners' mental and physical well-being and aid smooth running of the prison.; Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

335,Trouble sleeping inside: A cross-sectional study of the prevalence and associated risk factors of insomnia in adult prison populations in England,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence of insomnia and identify associated demographic, clinical and forensic risk factors in adult prisoners in England. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 237 prisoners aged 18â€“72 years, across two male prisons and one female prison in North England. We used the Sleep Condition Indicator to measure probable DSM-V insomnia disorder (ID) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to examine sleep quality. Multiple demographic, sleep, clinical and forensic self-reported measures were recorded to identify any associations with insomnia. Results: Overall, the prevalence of possible DSM-V ID was 61.6% (95% CI, 55.5%â€“67.8%). Subjective poor sleep quality was reported by 88.2% (95% CI, 84.1%â€“92.3%). Seven in ten (70.6%) female prisoners had possible DSM-V ID (95% CI, 64.8%â€“76.4%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for gender and age, indicated odds of having possible ID in prison were increased for the following factors: history of physical ill-health (OR = 3.62, 95% CI, 1.31â€“9.98); suicidality (OR = 2.79, 95% CI, 1.01.7.66), previously asked for help for insomnia (OR = 2.58, 95% CI, 1.21â€“5.47), depression (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.31â€“3.24), greater endorsement of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (OR = 1.50, 95% CI, 1.21â€“1.87), poor sleep hygiene (OR = 1.11, 95% CI, 1.04â€“1.19), and problematic prison environment (eg, noise, light or temperature) (OR = 1.07, 95% CI, 1.02â€“1.12). Conclusions: For the first time we have established the prevalence and associated factors of insomnia in a large sample of adult English prisoners. ID and poor sleep quality are common, especially in female prisoners. These findings emphasize/amplify the need for dedicated treatment pathways to improve screening, assessment and treatment of insomnia in prison.

336,Spinal cord injury and psychological response,"Psychological adjustment and psychopathological morbidity issues during rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injury have been documented in international literature. In this prospective study, a sample of 65 patients being treated in a rehabilitation unit during the years of 1993, 1994, and 1995, was obtained. The authors study the type of psychological response, when it does occur, which personality traits point to less suffering, which coping mechanisms are used by the better adjusted patients, and the differences between the scores of paraplegic and quadriplegic patients. Findings indicate that psychopathological scores consistent with depression occurred in 60% of patients if we consider any evaluation. Sleep disturbances, suicide ideation and guilt occurred in the same proportion. In 33% of them, we found persistent depressive scores in the two assessments. A highly significant positive correlation between psychopathology and neuroticism was found. On the contrary, the extraversion dimensions of EPI seem to be a good prognosis predictive factor as far as the occurrence of psychopathology is concerned. No differences in the psychopathological response were found concerning the paraplegic-quadriplegic situation.

337,Effect of a Lay Counselor Intervention on Prevention of Major Depression in Older Adults Living in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: Preventing depression in older adults living in low- and middle-income countries is important because of the scarcity of treatment resources and the risk of disability, suicide, and dementia.; Objective: To assess whether an intervention for depression prevention provided by lay counselors is effective in older adults from low- and middle-income countries.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel-group randomized clinical trial with masked outcome assessment was performed in 181 older adults (â‰¥60 years) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms at rural and urban primary care clinics in Goa, India. The first participant entered the trial on March 31, 2015, and the last exited on June 2, 2017. Data analysis used the intention-to-treat approach.; Interventions: Lay counselors provided problem-solving therapy, brief behavioral treatment for insomnia, education in self-care of common medical disorders such as diabetes, and assistance in accessing medical and social programs.; Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was incidence of major depressive episodes. The study also assessed symptom change during 12 months (12-item General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12]; score range of 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms of depression and anxiety), functional status (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0; score range of 12 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater disability), cognition (Hindi Mini-Mental State Examination; score range of 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning), blood pressure, and body mass index to provide further clinical context.; Results: The study enrolled 181 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.6 [7.2] years; 114 [63.0%] female): 91 to the intervention arm (depression in later life [DIL] intervention) and 90 to care as usual (CAU). Incident episodes of major depression were lower in the DIL intervention than in the CAU group (4.40% vs 14.44%; log-rank Pâ€‰=â€‰.04; number needed to treat,â€‰9.95; 95% CI, 5.12-182.43). The 12-month Kaplan-Meier estimates of percentage of depression-free participants were 95.1% (95% CI, 90.5%-99.9%) in the DIL group vs 87.4% (95% CI, 80.4%-95.1%) in the CAU group. The incidence of depressive symptoms (GHQ-12) was also less (12-month mean difference, -1.18; 95% CI, -2.03 to -0.31; groupâ€‰Ã—â€‰time interaction Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). There were no changes in measures of disability or cognition. The DIL intervention was associated with a significantly greater lowering of systolic blood pressure (12-month mean difference, -6.98; 95% CI, -11.96 to -2.01; groupâ€‰Ã—â€‰time interaction Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) and change in body mass index (12-month mean difference, 0.23; 95% CI, -0.97 to 1.43; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04).; Conclusions and Relevance: The DIL intervention is effective for preventing episodes of major depression in older persons with subsyndromal symptoms. If replicated, the DIL intervention may be effective in older adults living in low- and middle-income countries.; Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02145429.; ","Dias, Amit; Azariah, Fredric; Anderson, Stewart J.; Sequeira, Miriam; Cohen, Alex; Morse, Jennifer Q.; Cuijpers, Pim; Patel, Vikram & Reynolds, Charles F, 3rd",1,337
338,Cognitive and behavioral aspects of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome,"The brain's high concentrations of cholesterol make it especially vulnerable to the cholesterol biosynthetic defect that characterizes Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). An attempt to characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of SLOS has identified increased rates of intellectual disability, language and motor developmental delay, repeated self-injury behaviors, sensory hyperreactivity, hyperactivity, affect dysregulation, and sleep disturbances. Some research has suggested that carriers of the gene mutation that results in SLOS display increased risk of suicidal behavior. Cholesterol dysregulation impairs neuroplasticity, which may be a mechanism underlying some of the mentioned abnormalities. Discrete positive effects have been reported with the use of cholesterol supplementation in the treatment of SLOS. Research has been limited by the small number of subjects available, and a limited understanding of lipid metabolism in the brain. Hopefully future research will help clarify the role that cholesterol plays in cognitive and behavioral abnormalities like the ones associated with SLOS. This would accelerate the development of treatments for SLOS, and perhaps also further understanding of non-syndromic psychiatric disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.; Copyright Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Cognition Disorders/*complications, Mental Disorders/*complications, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome/*physiopathology, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome/*psychology, Autistic Disorder/complications, Autistic Disorder/diagnosis, Child, Child, Preschool, Cognition Disorders/diagnosis, Female, Humans, Intellectual Disability/complications, Intellectual Disability/diagnosis, Male, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome/diagnosis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome/genetics","Diaz-Stransky, Andrea & Tierney, Elaine",0,338
339,Mental and Physical Health and Intimate Partner Violence against Women: A Review of the Literature,"Associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) and poor physical and mental health of women have been demonstrated in the international and national literature across numerous studies. This paper presents a review of the literature on this topic. The 75 papers included in this review cover both original research studies and those which undertook secondary analyses of primary data sources. The reviewed research papers published from 2006 to 2012 include quantitative and qualitative studies from Western and developing countries. The results show that while there is variation in prevalence of IPV across various cultural settings, IPV was associated with a range of mental health issues including depression, PTSD, anxiety, self-harm, and sleep disorders. In most studies, these effects were observed using validated measurement tools. IPV was also found to be associated with poor physical health including poor functional health, somatic disorders, chronic disorders and chronic pain, gynaecological problems, and increased risk of STIs. An increased risk of HIV was reported to be associated with a history of sexual abuse and violence. The implications of the study findings in relation to methodological issues, clinical significance, and future research direction are discussed.; ","Dillon, Gina; Hussain, Rafat; Loxton, Deborah & Rahman, Saifur",0,339
340,Differential symptom reduction by drugs and psychotherapy in acute depression,"A randomized, controlled trial compared the combination of amitriptyline hydrochloride (100-200 mg) and short-term interpersonal psychotherapy, either treatment alone, and a nonscheduled treatment control group in 81 ambulatory acute, nonbipolar, nonpsychotic depressives. Results show the efficacy of both psychotherapy and amitriptyline in overall symptom reduction. Amitriptyline and psychotherapy were about equal, and the effects of both treatments in combination were additive. The additive effect of combined treatment was largely due to the differential effects of the 2 treatments. Amitriptyline had its effect mainly on the vegetative symptoms of depression such as sleep and appetite disturbance; these occurred early in treatment, often within the 1st wk. Psychotherapy had its effect mainly on mood, suicidal ideation, work, and interests; these effects occurred slightly later (4-8 wks).

341,Diagnosis and symptoms of mental disorder in a rural area of Senegal,"A study was carried out in a rural area of Senegal to ascertain the pattern of mental disorders among patients presenting at primary health facilities. Among 545 children aged 5-15 years, attending health centres and posts, 17% were found to be suffering from some form of emotional problem, behaviour disturbance or neuro-psychiatric disorders. Using a 10-item screening questionnaire, it was shown that the symptoms never plays with others' and ""speech disturbance' were the strongest predictors of mental disorder among children. Among 933 adults it was found that 16% reported more than seven symptoms commonly associated with psychiatric illness on a 24-item self-reporting questionnaire. The order in adults does not allow a precise estimate of morbidity to be made. Health workers diagnosed 9% of the patients as suffering from a mental health problem usually in association with a physical problem. It was found that psychotic and suicidal symptoms (e.g. hallucinations delusions) were more likely to be recognized by health workers as diagnostic of mental disorder whereas psychophysiological symptoms (e.g. anorexia insomnia headache) and psychological symptoms (e.g. anxiety depression) were less frequently recognized. The study supports the view that psychological symptoms and mental disorders occur relatively frequently among adults and children attending primary health facilities. Data allowing insight into the diagnostic sensitivity of primary health workers can provide a rational basis for planning training programmes in mental health.;""Accession Number: 6307031.

342,The associations between self-reported sleep duration and adolescent health outcomes: What is the role of time spent on Internet use?,"Objective: This study aimed to examine the associations of self-reported sleep duration with adolescent health outcomes, taking into account time spent on Internet use. Methods: We used data from the 2008-2009 Korea Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, a cross-sectional online survey of middle and high school students aged 13-18 years in South Korea (N = 136,589) to examine the associations of self-reported sleep duration with four mental and physical health measures, e.g. self-report of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, weight status, and self-rated health. The binary logit and generalized ordered logit models controlled for time spent on Internet use for non-study purposes and other factors. Results: Shorter self-reported sleep duration was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and overweight or obese status, and a lower likelihood of reporting better self-rated health, even after accounting for time spent on Internet use. Excessive Internet use was found to be an independent risk factor for these outcomes. Conclusions: Among in-school adolescents in South Korea, shorter sleep duration and excessive Internet use are independently and additively associated with multiple indicators of adverse health status. Excessive Internet use may have not only direct adverse health consequences, but also have indirect negative effects through sleep deprivation.

343,"Post-traumatic stress disorder, associated medical illnesses, and suicidal behavior: Plenty of room for new research","The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in patients who develop hyperarousal symptoms (irritability, hypervigilance, anxiety, etc.), nightmares, flashbacks, and avoidant behavior in response to a traumatic experience involving, for example, combat, partner or parental abuse, or street violence. PTSD is strongly associated with a wide spectrum of clinical and social impairments that can dramatically decrease one's quality of life. The relationship between PTSD and suicidal behavior is quite complex, with mounting data indicating a high degree of psychiatric and medical comorbidities in this patient population, and each co-occurring disorder representing an independent risk factor for suicidal behavior. Depression, a frequent psychiatric comorbidity of PTSD, has been shown to be associated with a high rate of suicide attempts and completed suicides. Given that PTSD and other medical illnesses separately contribute to suicide risk, we hypothesize that the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with concomitant PTSD and medical illnesses is different from that in patients with either disorder alone. Given the medical, social, and economic implications of suicide, future studies must address these questions, and, in the process, create a new interdisciplinary area of research with the long-term goal of decreasing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with comorbid PTSD and medical illnesses.

344,"The underexamined association between posttraumatic stress disorder, medical illness and suicidal behavior","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is concerning not only because of the severity and chronicity of its symptoms--including distressing nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety attacks and maladaptive patterns of avoidant and nearly paranoid behavior--but also because of the wide spectrum of clinical and social impairments it is tightly associated with. The most striking example of clinical morbidity associated with PTSD is the well-known increase in the risk of suicidal behavior. Given that PTSD and medical illnesses increase the likelihood of suicide separately and independently, it is reasonable to suggest that the risk of suicidal behavior differs between patients suffering from PTSD comorbid with medical illnesses and patients having either condition alone. The available data point toward a novel clinical notion, an altered risk of suicidal behavior in patients suffering from comorbid PTSD and medical illnesses. This area of overlap between medicine and psychiatry is still in its infancy, with many unanswered questions about the rate, patterns and psychobiological mechanisms of suicidal behavior in this patient population. The positive association between PTSD, medical illness and suicidal behavior that appears to exist in the adult population, most likely affects the pediatric population as well. Closer investigation into the significance of the association between chronic medical illnesses, PTSD and suicidality in children, adolescents and adults is necessary.

345,Correlates of suicide among veterans treated in primary care: Case“control study of a nationally representative sample,"Background: Veterans receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare have increased suicide risk compared to the general population. Many patients see primary care clinicians prior to suicide. Yet little is known about the correlates of suicide among patients who receive primary care treatment prior to death. Objective: Our aim was to describe characteristics of veterans who received VA primary care in the 6 months prior to suicide; and to compare these to characteristics of control patients who also received VA primary care. Design: This was a retrospective caseâ€“control study. Subjects: The investigators partnered with VA operations leaders to obtain death certificate data from 11 states for veterans who died by suicide in 2009. Cases were matched 1:2 to controls based on age, sex, and clinician. Main Measures: Demographic, diagnosis, and utilization data were obtained from VAâ€™s Corporate Data Warehouse. Additional clinical and psychosocial context data were collected using manual medical record review. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations between potential predictor variables and suicide. Key Results: Two hundred and sixty-nine veteran cases were matched to 538 controls. Average subject age was 63 years; 97 % were male. Rates of mental health conditions, functional decline, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and psychosocial stressors were all significantly greater in cases compared to controls. In the final model describing men in the sample, non-white race (OR = 0.51; 95 % CI = 0.27â€“0.98) and VA service-connected disability (OR = 0.54; 95 % CI = 0.36â€“0.80) were associated with decreased odds of suicide, while anxiety disorder (OR = 3.52; 95 % CI = 1.79â€“6.92), functional decline (OR = 2.52; 95 % CI = 1.55â€“4.10), depression (OR = 1.82; 95 % CI = 1.07â€“3.10), and endorsement of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.27; 95 % CI = 1.07â€“4.83) were associated with greater odds of suicide. Conclusions: Assessment for anxiety disorders and functional decline in addition to suicidal ideation and depression may be especially important for determining suicide risk in this population. Continued development of interventions that support identifying and addressing these conditions in primary care is indicated.

346,"Severity, prevalence, predictors, and rate of identification of insomnia symptoms in a sample of hospitalized psychiatric patients","Insomnia is a risk factor for new onset, exacerbation, and relapse of mental illness. The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence, severity, and predictors of insomnia in hospitalized psychiatric patients. Ninety-seven consecutive psychiatric inpatients were administered the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to evaluate the presence and severity of insomnia. Patients' hospital charts were reviewed for demographic and medical information. ISI scores in 79.4% of the patients reached the threshold criterion of 8 for insomnia. Insomnia was not mentioned as a clinical problem in the discharge notes problem list in any of these patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that age (p = 0.009), recent suicide attempt or ideation (P < 0.001), tobacco use (p = 0.024), and recreational drug use during the past month (p = 0.040) were significant predictors of insomnia severity. Insomnia was highly prevalent in this population. Identification and management of insomnia would be an important clinical goal in hospitalized psychiatric patients.

348,Relationship Between Leaving Children at Home Alone and Their Mental Health: Results From the A-CHILD Study in Japan,"Leaving children at home alone is considered a form of neglect"" in most developed countries. In Japan this practice is not prohibited probably because this country is considered to have relatively safe communities for children. The impact of leaving children at home alone on their mental health is a controversial issue and few studies have examined it to date. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of leaving children aged 6 or 7 years at home alone on their mental health focusing on both the positive and negative aspects; that is resilience difficult behavior and prosocial behavior. Data from the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study were used. The caregivers of all children in the first grade in Adachi City Tokyo were targeted of whom 80% completed the questionnaire (n = 4291). Among the analytical sample which comprises those who completed both exposure and outcome variables (n = 4195)2190 (52.2%) children had never been left at home alone1 and difficult behavior (emotional symptoms conduct problems hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship problems) and prosocial behavior using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to examine the dose-response association between leaving children at home alone and child mental health followed by propensity-score matching as a pseudo-randomized controlled trial to reduce potential confounding. The results showed that leaving children at home alone once a week or more but not less than once a week was associated with total difficulties scores especially conduct problems hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship problems. These findings indicate that leaving children at home alone should be avoided in Japan as is recommended in North America.; ""Japan, difficult behavior, leaving children at home alone, prosocial behavior, resilience","Doi, Satomi; Fujiwara, Takeo; Isumi, Aya; Ochi, Manami & Kato, Tsuguhiko",1,348
349,Association of sleep habits with behavior problems and resilience of 6- to 7-year-old children: Results from the A-CHILD study,"Background: Childhood sleep habits are associated with mental health development; however, little is known about the impact of irregular bedtimes on the mental health of early school-aged children. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of weekday sleep habits (varying bedtimes depending on the night of the week and later than 22:00 h bedtime) on behavior problems, prosocial behavior, and resilience of children aged 6â€“7 years. Methods: Data were taken from the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study, which involved the participation of 4291 caregivers of first-grade children (6â€“7 years old) living in Adachi City, Tokyo. Resilience (using the Children's Resilient Coping Scale), behavior problems (using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire), both modified to range 0â€“100, and sleep habits were measured via a questionnaire filled out by caregivers. Propensity-score matching was used to determine the associations between irregular and late bedtime, behavior problems, prosocial behavior, and resilience. Results: A total of 320 (7.5%) children showed irregular bedtime on school nights and 540 (13.6%) children went to bed later than 22:00 h. Children with irregular bedtimes on weekdays showed lower resilience (Î² = âˆ’3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = âˆ’5.90 to âˆ’1.10) and higher levels of behavior problems (Î² = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.13â€“5.46), especially hyperactivity/inattention (Î² = 5.76, 95% CI = 2.03 to 9.49) and peer relationship problems (Î² = 3.79, 95% CI = 1.02â€“6.55). On the other hand, no association between bedtime after 22:00 h and resilience or behavior problems was found. Conclusion: Among early school-aged children, irregular bedtime on weekdays may be a risk factor for lower resilience and behavior problems.

Odds ratios for suicidal compared with nonsuicidal ideation were also calculated.; Results: About 6% of the calls to the hotline were suicide related, and about 2% of the callers had attempted suicide in the past. Odds ratios for suicidal ideation increased during winter, but no daily tendencies were evident. Those whose problems were related to their way of life were at the highest risk of suicidal ideation, followed by those with health-related concerns.; Conclusion: We were able to identify risk factors for suicidal ideation based on an analysis of enormous amounts of data from a telephone crisis hotline in Japan.

351,Injured civilian survivors of suicide bomb attacks: from partial PTSD to recovery or to traumatisation Where is the turning point?,"Objective: To assess the short- (3-9 months) and medium-term (30 months) occurrence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in civilian survivors of suicide bombing terrorist attacks.; Method: We evaluated 129 injured survivors of nine attacks in Israel who were treated in our emergency room between June 2000 and September 2002. Data on demographics, physical injuries and psychiatric symptoms were collected by both a structured clinical interview and standard assessment scales for depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Diagnosis of PTSD was based on a Hebrew-validated DSM-IV SCID-PTSD rating scale.; Results: At the first assessment (short-term), 20 survivors (15.5%) met the criteria for full-blown PTSD and 54 (42%) for sub-clinical PTSD, while 55 (42.5%) evidenced no symptoms of PTSD. Two years later, only 54 patients could be located: 19 (35%) of them had either persistent or de novo PTSD and none had residual sub-clinical PTSD.; Conclusions: Relatively few survivors of suicide bomb attacks had full-blown PTSD, while a substantial number of survivors had short-term sub-clinical PTSD. Two-year follow-up evaluations revealed that a significant a number of the patients available for testing (35%) had full-blown PTSD. These findings imply that medium-term follow-up of survivors is needed in order to establish the actual prevalence of PTSD.;Bombs*, Blast Injuries/*psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology, Terrorism/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Blast Injuries/etiology, Female, Humans, Israel, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychotherapy, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/etiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/therapy, Suicide, Survivors/psychology, Time Factors, Young Adult","Dolberg, Ornah T; Barkai, Gabriel; Leor, Agnes; Rapoport, Helena; Bloch, Miki & Schreiber, Shaul",0,351
352,Neurophysiological correlates of suicidal ideation in major depressive disorder: Hyperarousal during sleep,"Background: Suicide is a major public health concern, and a barrier to reducing the suicide rate is the lack of objective predictors of risk. The present study considers whether quantitative sleep electroencephalography (EEG) may be a neurobiological correlate of suicidal ideation. Methods: Participants included 84 (45 female, mean age = 26.6) adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). The item that measures thoughts of death or suicide on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) was used to classify 47 participants as low suicidal ideation (24 females, mean age = 26.1) and 37 as high suicidal ideation (21 females, mean age = 27.3). Data were obtained from archival samples collected at the University of Michigan and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center between 2004 and 2012. Sleep EEG was quantified using power spectral analysis, and focused on alpha, beta, and delta frequencies. Results: Results indicated that participants with high compared to low suicidal ideation experienced 1) increased fast frequency activity, 2) decreased delta activity, and 3) increased alpha-delta sleep after adjusting for age, sex, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Limitations: Limitations include the exclusion of imminent suicidal intent, a single suicidal ideation item, and cross-sectional archival data. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to provide preliminary support that electrophysiological brain activity during sleep is associated with increased suicidal ideation in MDD, and may point toward central nervous system (CNS) hyperarousal during sleep as a neurobiological correlate of suicidal ideation.

353,Residual symptoms and recurrence during maintenance treatment of late-life depression,"Background: Many older patients who recover from an episode of major depression continue to suffer from depressed mood, anxiety, and sleep problems. Our study assesses the impact of these residual symptoms on the risk of recurrence during maintenance treatment of late-life depression. Method: We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial of maintenance treatment in patients with unipolar depression aged â‰¥70, 116 of whom remitted and remained stable during open pharmacotherapy and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and were randomized to clinical management/pharmacotherapy; clinical management/placebo; monthly maintenance IPT/ pharmacotherapy; or monthly maintenance IPT/placebo. We assessed the impact of overall residual symptoms (based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score) and of specific residual symptom clusters--mood symptoms (depressed mood, guilt, suicidality, energy/interests), sleep disturbance (early, middle, late insomnia), and anxiety (agitation, psychic and somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis) measured at randomization. Sleep disturbance was also assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for assignment to antidepressant medication versus placebo to identify predictors of recurrence. Results: Residual anxiety and residual sleep disturbance (as measured by the PSQI but not the HAM-D) independently predicted early recurrence. Limitations: Use of HAM-D clusters to define residual symptoms; analysis limited to completers of acute and continuation treatment. Conclusions: In patients with late-life depression who have remitted with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, the deleterious effect of residual symptoms is due to persisting anxiety and, possibly, residual sleep disturbance.

354,Atypical behaviors in children with autism and children with a history of language impairment,"The frequency, course, and inter-relationships of atypical eating, sleeping, self-injurious behavior, aggression and temper tantrums in children with autism and children with a history of language impairment (HLI), was investigated using a parent interview that was created to examine these problem behaviors. The relationships between these behaviors and language, IQ, severity of autistic symptoms and depression were also assessed. Atypical eating behavior, abnormal sleep patterns, temper tantrums, and self-injurious behavior were significantly more common in the children with autism than those with HLI. Within the autism group, children who exhibited more atypical behaviors tended to have a lower nonverbal IQ, lower levels of expressive language, more severe social deficits and more repetitive behaviors. No relationship between the number of atypical behaviors and measures of cognitive or language ability was noted in the HLI group. However, having more atypical behaviors was related to increased restricted, repetitive behaviors in children with HLI. The atypical behaviors could be divided into two groups: abnormal eating and sleeping, which were independent and tended to begin early in life; and self-injury, tantrums and aggression, which began later and were inter-related. Sleep abnormalities were more common in children (groups combined) diagnosed with major depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

355,"Depression and the relationship between sleep disturbances, nightmares, and suicidal ideation in treatment-seeking Canadian Armed Forces members and veterans","Background: Research on the relationship between insomnia and nightmares, and suicidal ideation (SI) has produced variable findings, especially with regard to military samples. This study investigates whether depression mediated the relationship between: 1) sleep disturbances and SI, and 2) trauma-related nightmares and SI, in a sample of treatment-seeking Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel and veterans (N = 663). Method: Regression analyses were used to investigate associations between sleep disturbances or trauma-related nightmares and SI while controlling for depressive symptom severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, anxiety symptom severity, and alcohol use severity. Bootstrapped resampling analyses were used to investigate the mediating effect of depression. Results: Approximately two-thirds of the sample (68%; N = 400) endorsed sleep disturbances and 88% (N = 516) reported experiencing trauma-related nightmares. Although sleep disturbances and trauma-related nightmares were both significantly associated with SI on their own, these relationships were no longer significant when other psychiatric conditions were included in the models. Instead, depressive symptom severity emerged as the only variable significantly associated with SI in both equations. Bootstrap resampling analyses confirmed a significant mediating role of depression for sleep disturbances. Conclusions: The findings suggest that sleep disturbances and trauma-related nightmares are associated with SI as a function of depressive symptoms in treatment-seeking CAF personnel and veterans. Treating depression in patients who present with sleep difficulties may subsequently help mitigate suicide risk.

356,Sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation in a sample of treatment-seeking Canadian Forces members and veterans,"This study examines the association between suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances in a sample of treatment-seeking Canadian Forces members and veterans, after controlling for probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Subjects included members and veterans of Canadian Forces seeking treatment at a hospital-based Operational Stress Injury Clinic (n=404). Sleep disturbances and nightmares were measured using individual items on the PTSD Checklist - Military Version (PCL - M), while the suicidality item of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used as a stand-alone item to assess presence or absence of suicidal ideation. Regression analyses were used to determine the respective impact of (1) insomnia and (2) nightmares on suicidal ideation, while controlling for presence of probable PTSD, MDD, GAD, and AUD. We found that 86.9% of patients reported having problems falling or staying asleep and 67.9% of patients reported being bothered by nightmares related to military-specific traumatic events. Neither sleep disturbances nor nightmares significantly predicted suicidal ideation; instead, probable MDD emerged as the most significant predictor.

357,Smartphones for smarter delivery of mental health programs: a systematic review,"Background: The rapid growth in the use of mobile phone applications (apps) provides the opportunity to increase access to evidence-based mental health care.; Objective: Our goal was to systematically review the research evidence supporting the efficacy of mental health apps for mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) for all ages.; Methods: A comprehensive literature search (2008-2013) in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, PsycTESTS, Compendex, and Inspec was conducted. We included trials that examined the effects of mental health apps (for depression, anxiety, substance use, sleep disturbances, suicidal behavior, self-harm, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, stress, and gambling) delivered on mobile devices with a pre- to posttest design or compared with a control group. The control group could consist of wait list, treatment-as-usual, or another recognized treatment.; Results: In total, 5464 abstracts were identified. Of those, 8 papers describing 5 apps targeting depression, anxiety, and substance abuse met the inclusion criteria. Four apps provided support from a mental health professional. Results showed significant reductions in depression, stress, and substance use. Within-group and between-group intention-to-treat effect sizes ranged from 0.29-2.28 and 0.01-0.48 at posttest and follow-up, respectively.; Conclusions: Mental health apps have the potential to be effective and may significantly improve treatment accessibility. However, the majority of apps that are currently available lack scientific evidence about their efficacy. The public needs to be educated on how to identify the few evidence-based mental health apps available in the public domain to date. Further rigorous research is required to develop and test evidence-based programs. Given the small number of studies and participants included in this review, the high risk of bias, and unknown efficacy of long-term follow-up, current findings should be interpreted with caution, pending replication.

358,Risks of Benzodiazepines in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Comorbid Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Rationale: Benzodiazepines are associated with mortality and poor outcomes among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but use of benzodiazepines for dyspnea among patients with end-stage disease may confound this relationship.; Objectives: Assess the mortality risks of long-term benzodiazepine exposure among patients with COPD and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), patients with chronic nonrespiratory indications for benzodiazepines.; Methods: We identified all patients with COPD and PTSD within the Veteran's Health Administration between 2010 and 2012. We calculated propensity scores for benzodiazepine use and compared overall and cause-specific mortality of patients with long-term (â‰¥90 d) benzodiazepine use relative to matched patients without use. Secondary analyses assessed propensity-adjusted survival by characteristics of benzodiazepine exposure.; Results: Among 44,555 eligible patients with COPD and PTSD, 23.6% received benzodiazepines long term. In the matched sample of 19,552 patients, we observed no mortality difference (hazard ratio [HR] for long-term use, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.18) but greater risk of death by suicide among those with long-term use (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.14-4.79). Among matched and unmatched patients, short-term benzodiazepine use, but not long-term use, was associated with increased mortality (short-term: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28; long-term: HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13).; Conclusions: Risks for respiratory compromise related to long-term benzodiazepine use in COPD may be less than previously estimated, but short-term use of benzodiazepines could still pose a mortality risk. Suicide associated with benzodiazepine use in this population warrants further investigation.; benzodiazepine, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicide","Donovan, Lucas M.; Malte, Carol A.; Spece, Laura J.; Griffith, Matthew F.; Feemster, Laura C.; Engelberg, Ruth A.; Au, David H. & Hawkins, Eric J.",1,358
359,Recognizing and treating depression in children and adolescents,"Purpose: The clinical presentation and neurobiology of depression in youth and its appropriate treatment, as well as strategies for improving therapeutic benefit and preventing adverse outcomes, including suicide, are reviewed.; Summary: Functionally impairing depression occurs in 2-10% of children and adolescents. A diagnosis of depression should be considered when a physically healthy child exhibits depressed mood or anhedonia, multiple somatic complaints, or behavioral changes, such as bullying, aggression, and social withdrawal. Risk factors for depression include childhood trauma, genetic susceptibility, and environmental stressors. Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are the most effective treatments for adolescents with depression. Youth are at risk for the same adverse effects as adults but have an increased risk of behavioral activation, or switch, to mania and suicidal thoughts and behaviors early in treatment. Compared with other antidepressants, fluoxetine has the most evidence for safety and efficacy, particularly in adolescents 12 years or older. There is very little evidence for the effectiveness of any antidepressant in children 11 years and younger. Youth receiving antidepressants should be monitored closely for new-onset or worsening suicidality, particularly during the first two weeks after starting medication, and for three months of therapy. Behavioral activation, aggression, worsening depression, anxiety, insomnia, or impulsivity can herald a switch to mania or suicidality.; Conclusion: Depression in youth is common and treatable and responds best to multimodal treatment combining patient and family education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressant medication. The potential benefits of antidepressants outweigh the risks for adolescents.

360,"Geriatric psychiatry review: differential diagnosis and treatment of the 3 D's - delirium, dementia, and depression","The three D's of Geriatric Psychiatry-delirium, dementia, and depression-represent some of the most common and challenging diagnoses for older adults. Delirium is often difficult to diagnose and treatment is sometimes controversial with the use of antipsychotic medications, but it is common in a variety of patient care settings and remains an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older adults. Dementia may affect a significant number of older adults and is associated with delirium, depression, frailty, and failure to thrive. Treatment of dementia is challenging and while medication interventions are common, environmental and problem solving therapies may have some of the greatest benefits. Finally, depression increases with age and is more likely to present with somatic complaints or insomnia and is more likely to be reported to a primary care physician than any other healthcare provider by older adults. Depression carries an increased risk for suicide in older adults and proven therapies should be initiated immediately. These three syndromes have great overlap, can exist simultaneously in the same patient, and often confer increased risk for each other. The primary care provider will undoubtedly benefit from a solid foundation in the identification, classification, and treatment of these common problems of older adulthood.;Delirium*/diagnosis, Delirium*/therapy, Dementia*/diagnosis, Dementia*/therapy, Depressive Disorder*/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder*/therapy, Aged, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans","Downing, Lisa J; Caprio, Thomas V & Lyness, Jeffrey M",0,360
361,"Suicidality in sleep disorders: prevalence, impact, and management strategies","Sleep disturbances are associated with suicide-related thoughts and behaviors, and the incidence of sleep concerns and suicide has increased recently in the US. Most published research exploring the sleep-suicidality relation is focused on select sleep disorders, with few reviews offering a comprehensive overview of the sleep-suicidality literature. This narrative review broadly investigates the growing research literature on sleep disorders and suicidality, noting the prevalence of suicide ideation and nonfatal and fatal suicide attempts, the impact of several sleep disorders on suicide risk, and potential sleep-disorder management strategies for mitigating suicide risk. Aside from insomnia symptoms and nightmares, there exist opportunities to learn more about suicide risk across many sleep conditions, including whether sleep disorders are associated with suicide risk independently of other psychiatric conditions or symptoms. Generally, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials examining the modification of suicide risk via evidence-based sleep interventions for individuals with sleep disorders.; insomnia, nightmares, sleep, suicidality, suicide, treatment","Drapeau, Christopher W. & Nadorff, Michael R.",0,361
362,Who is the Treatment-Seeking Young Adult with Severe Obesity: A Comprehensive Characterization with Emphasis on Mental Health,"Objective: To characterize treatment-seeking young adults (16-25 years) with severe obesity, particularly mental health problems.; Study Design and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 165 participants (132 women, 33 men) with BMI â‰¥35 kg/m2 or â‰¥30 kg/m2 with comorbidities, enrolling in a multidisciplinary obesity treatment program.; Method: Data collection at admission of present and life-time health issues including symptomatology of anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Adult ADHD Self-Report scale); self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), suicide attempts, health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey), psychosocial functioning related to obesity (Obesity-related Problems Scale), cardiorespiratory fitness (Astrand's bicycle ergometer test), somatic and psychiatric co-morbidities, cardiometabolic risk factors, and micronutritional status. We used multiple regression analysis to identify variables independently associated with present anxiety and depressive symptomatology.; Results: Mean body mass index was 39.2 kg/m2 (SD = 5.2). We found evidence of poor mental health, including present psychiatric diagnoses (29%), symptomatology of anxiety (47%), depression (27%) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (37%); low self-esteem (42%), attempted suicide (12%), and low quality of life (physical component score = 46, SD = 11.2; mental component score = 36, SD = 13.9, P<0.001 for difference). Variables independently associated with present anxiety symptomatology (R2 = 0.33, P<0.001) included low self-esteem (P<0.001) and pain (P = 0.003), whereas present depressive symptomatology (R2 = 0.38, P<0.001) was independently associated with low self-esteem (P<0.001), low cardiorespiratory fitness (P = 0.009) and obesity-related problems (P = 0.018). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 3%, and hypertension 2%. Insulin resistance was present in 82%, lipid abnormality in 62%, and poor cardiorespiratory fitness in 92%. Forty-eight percent had at least one micronutritional deficiency, vitamin D being the most common (35%).; Conclusion: A wide range of health issues, including quite severe mental health problems, was prevalent in treatment-seeking young adults with severe obesity.

363,Is Dysregulation of the HPA-Axis a Core Pathophysiology Mediating Co-Morbid Depression in Neurodegenerative Diseases?,"There is increasing evidence of prodromal manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). These affective symptoms may be observed many years before the core diagnostic symptoms of the neurological condition. It is becoming more apparent that depression is a significant modifying factor of the trajectory of disease progression and even treatment outcomes. It is therefore crucial that we understand the potential pathophysiologies related to the primary condition, which could contribute to the development of depression. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis is a key neuroendocrine signaling system involved in physiological homeostasis and stress response. Disturbances of this system lead to severe hormonal imbalances, and the majority of such patients also present with behavioral deficits and/or mood disorders. Dysregulation of the HPA-axis is also strongly implicated in the pathology of major depressive disorder. Consistent with this, antidepressant drugs, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to alter HPA-axis activity. In this review, we will summarize the current state of knowledge regarding HPA-axis pathology in Alzheimer's, PD and HD, differentiating between prodromal and later stages of disease progression when evidence is available. Both clinical and preclinical evidence will be examined, but we highlight animal model studies as being particularly useful for uncovering novel mechanisms of pathology related to co-morbid mood disorders. Finally, we purpose utilizing the preclinical evidence to better inform prospective, intervention studies.; Alzheimerâ€™s disease, BDNFVal66Met, HPA-axis, Huntingtonâ€™s disease, Parkinsonian disorders, cortisol, depression, dexamethasone","Du, Xin & Pang, Terence Y.",0,363
364,Psychological comorbidities in Chinese patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure,"Objectives: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) experience long-term chronic liver diseases plus an acute liver function decompensation. This study aimed to determine whether psychological symptoms in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related ACLF differ from those with other chronic liver diseases and to identify which factors could predict psychological impairment in liver patients. Methods: This was a paired case-control study. A total of 120 inpatients, including 40 cases for HBV-related ACLF, 40 paired controls for HBV-related cirrhosis and 40 paired controls for chronic hepatitis B (CHB), as well as 40 paired healthy controls were studied. Results: A high proportion of patients with HBV-related ACLF were classified as Child's stage C. The prevalence of depression in patients with HBV-related ACLF was significantly higher than in CHB patients and healthy controls, but was equivalent to patients with HBV-related cirrhosis. Patients with HBV-related ACLF had significantly higher level of self-esteem than those with HBV-related cirrhosis. However, there was no significant difference among the three liver patient groups and healthy controls in anxiety and suicide intent. Lower education level, anxiety, poor sleep quality and greater severity of disease were associated with elevated depression. Conclusions: Patients with HBV-related ACLF and cirrhosis are at higher risk of depression. It appears that severity of liver disease measured by Child-Pugh class, rather than additional acute liver function decompensation, significantly predicted depression among liver patients.

365,Candidate Risks Indicators for Bipolar Disorder: Early Intervention Opportunities in High-Risk Youth,"Background: Psychiatric illnesses like bipolar disorder are increasingly understood to be neurodevelopmental disorders with clinical, psychological, and biological indicators recognizable long before the emergence of the full-blown syndromes.; Methods: This paper is a selective review of findings from studies of high-risk children of affected parents that inform the knowledge of illness risk and development markers of bipolar disorder. We specifically focus on candidate clinical, biological, and psychological risk indicators that could serve as targets for future early intervention and prevention studies.; Results: There is convergent evidence from prospective studies that bipolar disorder typically debuts as depressive episodes after puberty. In some high-risk children, sleep and anxiety disorders precede mood disorders by several years and reflect an increased vulnerability. An association between early exposure to adversity (eg, exposure to parental illness, neglect from mother) and increased risk of psychopathology may be mediated through increased stress reactivity evident at both behavioral and biological levels. Inter-related psychological processes including reward sensitivity, unstable self-esteem, rumination, and positive self-appraisal are risk factors for mood disorders. Disturbances in circadian rhythm and immune dysfunction are associated with mood disorders and may be vulnerability markers influenced by these other risk factors.; Conclusions: There is accruing evidence of a number of measurable and potentially modifiable markers of vulnerability and developing illness in youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies of multiple biological and psychological risk processes in high-risk offspring, both individually and together, will improve our understanding of illness onset and lead to the development of specific early interventions.; Â© The Author 2015.

In patients with PNES, significant associations were found between a history of sleep events and: convulsive clinical semiology, antiepileptic drug treatment, fatigue, suicide attempts, mood disorder, and physical abuse. A particularly strong association with social security benefit was also found (odds ratio 4.0, p<0.001).; Conclusions: The prevalence of a history of sleep events is similar in PNES and epilepsy, and is of no value in discriminating between the two, although a history of events occurring exclusively during sleep does suggest epileptic seizures. The clinical associations found indicate that a combination of psychopathological and external influences may be important in determining whether or not a patient with PNES gives a history of events during sleep.;Seizures/*physiopathology, Sleep/*physiology, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Electroencephalography, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Prospective Studies, Seizures/diagnosis, Seizures/epidemiology","Duncan, R; Oto, M; Russell, A J C & Conway, P",1,366
367,Ketamine-Induced Glutamatergic Mechanisms of Sleep and Wakefulness: Insights for Developing Novel Treatments for Disturbed Sleep and Mood,"Ketamine, a drug with rapid antidepressant effects and well-described effects on slow wave sleep (SWS), is a useful intervention for investigating sleep-wake mechanisms involved in novel therapeutics. The drug rapidly (within minutes to hours) reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD), including those with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine treatment elevates extracellular glutamate in the prefrontal cortex. Glutamate, in turn, plays a critical role as a proximal element in a ketamine-initiated molecular cascade that increases synaptic strength and plasticity, which ultimately results in rapidly improved mood. In MDD, rapid antidepressant response to ketamine is related to decreased waking as well as increased total sleep, SWS, slow wave activity (SWA), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Ketamine also increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. In individuals with MDD, clinical response to ketamine is predicted by low baseline delta sleep ratio, a measure of deficient early night production of SWS. Notably, there are important differences between MDD and BD that may be related to the effects of diagnosis or of mood stabilizers. Consistent with its effects on clock-associated molecules, ketamine alters the timing and amplitude of circadian activity patterns in rapid responders versus non-responders with MDD, suggesting that it affects mood-dependent central neural circuits. Molecular interactions between sleep homeostasis and clock genes may mediate the rapid and durable elements of clinical response to ketamine and its active metabolite.; Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Circadian, Major depressive disorder, Neuroplasticity, Slow wave sleep, Suicidality","Duncan, Wallace C, Jr; Ballard, Elizabeth D. & Zarate, Carlos A.",0,367
368,Circadian reinforcement therapy in combination with electronic self-monitoring to facilitate a safe post-discharge period of patients with depression by stabilizing sleep: protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"The transition phase from inpatient to outpatient care for patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder represents a vulnerable period associated with a risk of depression worsening and suicide. Our group has recently found that the sleep-wake cycle in discharged depressive patients became irregular and exhibited a drift towards later hours, associated with worsening of depression. In contrast, an advancement of sleep phase has earlier been shown to have an antidepressant effect. Thus, methods to prevent drift of the sleep-wake cycle may be promising interventions to prevent or reduce worsening of depression after discharge.Methods: In this trial, we apply a new treatment intervention, named Circadian Reinforcement Therapy (CRT), to patients discharged from inpatient psychiatric wards. CRT consists of a specialized psychoeducation on the use of regular time signals (zeitgebers): daylight exposure, exercise, meals, and social contact. The aim is to supply stronger and correctly timed zeitgebers to the circadian system to prevent sleep drift and worsening of depression. The CRT is used in combination with an electronic self-monitoring system, the Monsenso Daybuilder System (MDB). By use of the MDB system, all patients self-monitor their sleep, depression level, and activity (from a Fitbit bracelet) daily. Participants can inspect all their data graphically on the MDB interface and will have clinician contact. The aim is to motivate patients to keep a stable sleep-wake cycle. In all, 130 patients referred to an outpatient service will be included. Depression rating is blinded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to a Standard group or a CRT group. The intervention period is 4 weeks covering the transition phase from inpatient to outpatient care. The primary outcome is score change in interviewer rated levels of depression on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. A subset of patients will be assessed with salivary Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) as a validator of circadian timing.

Quinn et al. (see record [rid]2016-62202-018[/rid]). Quinn et al. aimed to identify predictors of incident and long-term opioid therapy using a large commercial health care claims database. The analysis by Quinn et al. reports patterns of use of more than 10 million patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Incident and long-term opioid therapy were identified. Several psychiatric conditions and medications evident before long-term opioid therapy were analyzed: opioid use disorder, non-opioid use disorder, depressive disorder, uncertain or definite suicide attempt or self-injury, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, motor vehicle crashes, and 11 psychoactive medication classes from prescription claims. Quinn et al. found that patients with prior psychiatric conditions or a history of taking psychoactive medications had greater odds to receive opioids. As highlighted by the authors, among psychoactive medications, benzodiazepine recipients had a 52% greater chance of receiving opioids than did benzodiazepine non-recipients.

370,"'Long-term cariprazine treatment for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial':Corrigendum","Reports an error in 'Long-term cariprazine treatment for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial' by Suresh Durgam, Willie Earley, Rui Li, Dayong Li, Kaifeng Lu, IstvÃ¡n Laszlovszky, W. Wolfgang Fleischhacker and Henry A. Nasrallah (Schizophrenia Research, 2016[Oct], Vol 176[2-3], 264-271). In the original article, there is an error on page 266 in section '3.2 Efficacy analysis.' The correction is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-35519-001[/rid]). Cariprazine, a dopamine Dâ‚ƒ/Dâ‚‚ receptor partial agonist with preference for Dâ‚ƒ receptors, has demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials in schizophrenia. This multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine for relapse prevention in adults with schizophrenia; total study duration was up to 97 weeks. Schizophrenia symptoms were treated/stabilized with cariprazine 3â€“9 mg/d during 20-week open-label treatment consisting of an 8-week, flexible-dose run-in phase and a 12-week fixed-dose stabilization phase. Stable patients who completed open-label treatment could be randomized to continued cariprazine (3, 6, or 9 mg/d) or placebo for double-blind treatment (up to 72 weeks). The primary efficacy parameter was time to relapse (worsening of symptom scores, psychiatric hospitalization, aggressive/violent behavior, or suicidal risk); clinical measures were implemented to ensure safety in case of impending relapse. A total of 264/765 patients completed open-label treatment; 200 eligible patients were randomized to double-blind placebo (n = 99) or cariprazine (n = 101). Time to relapse was significantly longer in cariprazine-versus placebo-treated patients (P = .0010, log-rank test). Relapse occurred in 24.8% of cariprazine- and 47.5% of placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.45 [0.28, 0.73]). Akathisia (19.2%), insomnia (14.4%), and headache (12.0%) were reported in â‰¥ 10% of patients during open-label treatment; there were no cariprazine adverse events â‰¥ 10% during double-blind treatment. Long-term cariprazine treatment was significantly more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia. The long-term safety profile in this study was consistent with the safety profile observed in previous cariprazine clinical trials.

371,Pathological Internet Use and Risk-Behaviors among European Adolescents,"Risk-behaviors are a major contributor to the leading causes of morbidity among adolescents and young people; however, their association with pathological Internet use (PIU) is relatively unexplored, particularly within the European context. The main objective of this study is to investigate the association between risk-behaviors and PIU in European adolescents. This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of the FP7 European Union project: Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE). Data on adolescents were collected from randomized schools within study sites across eleven European countries. PIU was measured using Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ). Risk-behaviors were assessed using questions procured from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS). A total of 11,931 adolescents were included in the analyses: 43.4% male and 56.6% female (M/F: 5179/6752), with a mean age of 14.89 Â± 0.87 years. Adolescents reporting poor sleeping habits and risk-taking actions showed the strongest associations with PIU, followed by tobacco use, poor nutrition and physical inactivity. Among adolescents in the PIU group, 89.9% were characterized as having multiple risk-behaviors. The significant association observed between PIU and risk-behaviors, combined with a high rate of co-occurrence, underlines the importance of considering PIU when screening, treating or preventing high-risk behaviors among adolescents.; Internet*, Adolescent Behavior/*psychology, Behavior, Addictive/*diagnosis, Behavior, Addictive/*psychology, Students/*psychology, Adolescent, Behavior, Addictive/epidemiology, Cross-Sectional Studies, Europe/epidemiology, Female, Humans, Male, Risk-Taking, Surveys and Questionnaires, Internet addiction, SEYLE, adolescents, multiple risk-behaviors, pathological Internet use, risk-behavior, unhealthy lifestyles","Durkee, Tony; Carli, Vladimir; Floderus, Birgitta; Wasserman, Camilla; Sarchiapone, Marco; Apter, Alan; Balazs, Judit A.; Bobes, Julio; Brunner, Romuald; Corcoran, Paul; Cosman, Doina; Haring, Christian; Hoven, Christina W.; Kaess, Michael; Kahn, Jean-Pierre; Nemes, Bogdan; Postuvan, Vita; Saiz, Pilar A.; VÃ¤rnik, Peeter & Wasserman, Danuta",0,371
372,Distinctiveness and correlates of maladaptive behaviour in children and adolescents with Smith-Magenis syndrome,"Examined the distinctiveness and correlates of maladaptive behaviour in 35 children and adolescents (aged 4-20 yrs) with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a developmental disorder caused by an interstitial deletion of chromosome 17. Exp 1 compared Child Behavior Checklist scores in Ss with Smith-Magenis syndrome to age- and gender-matched Ss with Prader-Willi syndrome and mixed intellectual disability. Smith-Magenis syndrome Ss had significantly higher levels of maladaptive behaviour than the other groups. Although some problems were shared across groups, 12 behaviours differentiated the 3 groups with 100% accuracy. Exp 2 assessed the frequency and correlates of self-injurious and stereotypical behaviours, including unusual features such as nail-yanking, inserting objects into bodily orifices, self-hugging and a lick-and flip"" behaviour. Nail-yanking and bodily insertions were less common than other types of self-injury and self-hugs and the ""lick-and flip"" stereotypies were seen in about half the Ss. Although age and degree of delay correlated with problem behaviours sleep disturbance emerged as the strongest predictor of maladaptive behaviour. Implications for clinical diagnostic ambiguities between Smith-Magenis and Prader-Willi syndromes and for intervention are discussed.

373,Patterns of distress in US medical students,"Background: How multiple forms of psychological distress coexist in individual medical students has not been formally studied. Aim: To explore the prevalence of various forms of distress in medical students and their relationship to recent suicidal ideation or serious thoughts of dropping out of school. Methods: All medical students at seven US schools were surveyed with standardized instruments to evaluate burnout, depression, stress, mental quality of life (QOL), physical QOL, and fatigue. Additional items explored recent suicidal ideation and serious thoughts of dropping out of medical school. Results: Nearly all (1846/2246, 82%) of medical students had at least one form of distress with 1066 (58%) having â‰¥3 forms of distress. A dose-response relationship was found between the number of manifestations of distress and recent suicidal ideation or serious thoughts of dropping out. For example, students with 2, 4, or 6 forms of distress were 5, 15, and 24 fold, respectively, more likely to have suicidal ideation than students with no forms of distress assessed. All forms of distress were independently associated with suicidal ideation or serious thoughts of dropping out on multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Most medical students experience â‰¥1 manifestation of distress with many experiencing multiple forms of distress simultaneously. The more forms of distress experienced the greater the risk for suicidal ideation and thoughts of dropping out of medical school.

374,"Factors associated with resilience to and recovery from burnout: A prospective, multiinstitutional study of US medical students","Context: Burnout is prevalent among medical students and is a predictor of subsequent serious consideration of dropping out of medical school and suicide ideation. Understanding of the factors that protect against burnout is needed to guide student wellness programmes. Methods: A total of 1321 medical students attending five institutions were studied longitudinally (2006â€“2007). The surveys included standardised instruments to evaluate burnout, quality of life, fatigue and stress. Additional items explored social support, learning climate, life events, employment status and demographics. Students who did not have burnout at either time-point (resilient students) were compared with those who indicated burnout at one or both time-points (vulnerable students) using a Wilcoxonâ€“Mannâ€“Whitney test or Fisherâ€™s exact test. Similarly, the differences between those who recovered and those who were chronically burned out were also compared in students with burnout at the first time-point. Logistic regression modelling was employed to evaluate associations between the independent variables and resiliency to and recovery from burnout. Results: Overall, 792 (60.0%) students completed the burnout inventory at both time-points. No differences in demographic characteristics were observed between resilient (290/792 [36.6%]) and vulnerable (502/792 [63.4%]) students. Resilient students were less likely to experience depression, had a higher quality of life, were less likely to be employed, had experienced fewer stressful life events, reported higher levels of social support, perceived their learning climate more positively and experienced less stress and fatigue (all p < 0.05) than vulnerable students. On multivariable analysis, perceiving student education as a priority for faculty staff, experiencing less stress, not being employed and being a minority were factors independently associated with recovery from burnout. Conclusions: Modifiable individual factors and learning climate characteristics including employment status, stress level and perceptions of the prioritising of student education by faculty members relate to medical studentsâ€™ vulnerability to burnout.

375,A pilot study to assess smokeless tobacco use reduction with varenicline,"Introduction: Long-term smokeless tobacco (ST) use is known to increase the risk for oropharyngeal cancer, heart attack, and stroke. Extant literature on cigarette smokers suggests that smoking reduction increases smoking abstinence among smokers not interested in quitting. Similarly, a reduction strategy may reduce ST exposure and increase ST abstinence rates among ST users not interested in quitting. Methods: We conducted a pilot study to obtain preliminary data on the use of 12 weeks of varenicline as a tobacco reduction strategy among ST users not interested in quitting. Results: We enrolled 20 male ST users with a mean age of 42.8 Â± 11.7 years who used an average of 3.9 Â± 1.7 cans/pouches per week for 18.6 Â± 8.6 years. At end of treatment (12 weeks), 60% (12/20) of subjects reduced their ST use by â‰¥50% and 15% (3/20) were biochemically confirmed abstinent from tobacco. At end of study (6 months), 50% (10/20) reduced by â‰¥50% of baseline use and 10% (2/20) were biochemically confirmed abstinent from tobacco. Varenicline reduced ST satisfaction, reward, and craving. Among subjects able to reduce ST, all subjects reported that reduction increased motivation and confidence in being able to maintain reduction and quit. The most common side effects were sleep disturbance (25%) and nausea (15%). Discussion: Varenicline may be effective in reducing ST use and achieving ST abstinence among ST users with no plans to quit but who are interested in reducing their ST use.

376,A pilot study of the efficacy of varenicline for the treatment of smokeless tobacco users in the Midwestern United States,"Introduction: Long-term smokeless tobacco (ST) use is known to increase the risk for oropharyngeal cancer, heart attack, and stroke. Varenicline has recently been demonstrated to increase ST abstinence rates among Swedish snus users. We have conducted a pilot study to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of varenicline for the treatment of ST users in Midwestern United States. Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the potential efficacy of 12 weeks of varenicline for the treatment of ST users with an a priori decision rule that a 1-tailed p < .20 for the comparison of the primary endpoint was evidence to conclude that future studies were warranted. Subjects were followed for 6 months after randomization. Results: We randomized 76 subjects (38 varenicline and 38 placebo). Subjects were similar at baseline with a mean age of 41 years, and all were male. The biochemically confirmed point prevalence tobacco abstinence rates at end of treatment were 55.3% for varenicline and 42.1% for placebo (p = .126) and 47.4% and 31.6% (p = .080), respectively, at 6 months. Point prevalence ST abstinence rates at end of treatment for varenicline were 57.9% and 42.1% for placebo (p = .084) and 57.9% and 31.6% (p = .011), respectively, at 6 months. Varenicline was associated with significantly less craving compared with placebo. Varenicline was well tolerated with nausea and sleep disturbance being the most common side effects. Conclusions: Varenicline decreases craving and may be effective for increasing tobacco abstinence rates among ST users. Larger trials may be warranted to confirm these results.

Commonly falsified diseases in the field of neurology are epileptic seizures, subarachnoid hemorrhaging, perception disorders, headaches, loss of consciousness, and craniocerebral trauma. In the field of psychiatry, patients tend to falsify psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disturbed thought processes. Suicidal impulses are also simulated, in addition to sleep disturbances, poor appetite accompanied by weight loss, difficulty in concentrating, and imperative voices.

378,Prevalence and characteristics of sexual abuse in a national sample of Swedish seventeen-year-old boys and girls,"The aims of this study, which was part of a survey on adolescent sexual behaviour, were to investigate adolescents' experience of child sexual abuse and to present possible abuse-related problems. Representative samples of 2% of Sweden's 17-y-old male and female students and school non-attenders were selected in a two-step procedure. In all, 1943 students and 210 school non-attenders answered a self-administered anonymous questionnaire, distributed by school nurses. Six out of 170 questions dealt with personal experiences of child sexual abuse, i.e. age at onset, frequency of abuse and relationship to the offender. Peer abuse was excluded by the definitions used. The overall response rate was 92.2% for students and 44.2% for school dropouts. Among male and female students, 3.1% and 11.2%, respectively, acknowledged sexual abuse, 2.3% and 7.1%, respectively, when exhibitionism was excluded. Mean age at onset was 9.1 y (SD 4.3) for boys and 9.0 y (SD 3.9) for girls; 1.2% of the boys and 3.1% of the girls reported abusive oral, vaginal and/or anal intercourse. Suicide attempts or other acts of self-harm were reported by 33.3% of the male students reporting abuse and by 5.1% (p < 0.001) of those who had not been abused, and by 30.4% of the abused student girls compared to 9.1% of the non-abused (p < 0.001). Sleep and eating disorders, use of alcohol at an early age and/or experimentation with illicit drugs and consensual coitarche before age 15 y was reported significantly more often by abused than non-abused girls (p < 0.001, differences not found among the student boys). Of school non-attenders, 4% of the boys and 28% of the girls reported sexual abuse. Of the abused girls, 49% reported abusive vaginal intercourse and 64% reported self-destructive behaviour or suicide attempts. No abused boys and few abused girls had confided in a teacher, health professional or social worker. Results from the student sample should be interpreted as markers of minimum prevalence"" as female school non-attenders report significantly higher prevalence of sexual abuse. Potential high-risk groups are better included in prevalence investigations of child sexual abuse. The fact that so few adolescents confided in ""professionals"" about the abuse despite having severe symptoms and signs of distress underlines the need to address sexual abuse when recording the social medical and psychiatric histories of adolescents.;""Accession Number: 10772279.

379,"Severity, course trajectory, and within-person variability of individual symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder","Background: Depression shows a large heterogeneity of symptoms between and within persons over time. However, most outcome studies have assessed depression as a single underlying latent construct, using the sum score on psychometric scales as an indicator for severity. This study assesses longitudinal symptom-specific trajectories and within-person variability of major depressive disorder over a 9-year period.; Methods: Data were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). This study included 783 participants with a current major depressive disorder at baseline. The Inventory Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR) was used to analyze 28 depressive symptoms at up to six time points during the 9-year follow-up.; Results: The highest baseline severity scores were found for the items regarding energy and mood states. The core symptoms depressed mood and anhedonia had the most favorable course, whereas sleeping problems and (psycho-)somatic symptoms were more persistent over 9-year follow-up. Within-person variability was highest for symptoms related to energy and lowest for suicidal ideation.; Conclusions: The severity, course, and within-person variability differed markedly between depressive symptoms.

380,A 6-year longitudinal study of predictors for suicide attempts in major depressive disorder,"AbstractBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD), represent a major source of risk for suicidality. However, knowledge about risk factors for future suicide attempts (SAs) within MDD is limited. The present longitudinal study examined a wide range of putative non-clinical risk factors (demographic, social, lifestyle, personality) and clinical risk factors (depressive and suicidal indicators) for future SAs among persons with MDD. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between a number of significant predictors and the incidence of a future SA.MethodsData are from 1713 persons (18â€“65 years) with a lifetime MDD at the baseline measurement of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety who were subsequently followed up 2, 4 and 6 years. SAs were assessed in the face-to-face measurements. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine a wide range of possible non-clinical and clinical predictors for subsequent SAs during 6-year follow-up.ResultsOver a period of 6 years, 3.4% of the respondents attempted suicide. Younger age, lower education, unemployment, insomnia, antidepressant use, a previous SA and current suicidal thoughts independently predicted a future SA. The number of significant risk factors (ranging from 0 to 7) linearly predicted the incidence of future SAs: in those with 0 predictors the SA incidence was 0%, which increased to 32% incidence in those with 6+ predictors.ConclusionOf the non-clinical factors, particularly socio-economic factors predicted a SA independently. Furthermore, preexisting suicidal ideation and insomnia appear to be important clinical risk factors for subsequent SA that are open to preventative intervention.

381,Psychosocial Risk Factors and Other Than Honorable Military Discharge: Providing Healthcare to Previously Ineligible Veterans,"Introduction: In response to a strong focus on suicide prevention for all veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently revised policy to provide emergency mental healthcare for veterans who received Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharges from the military. This current study takes a preliminary step toward identifying demographic, historic, military, clinical, and social characteristics of veterans with OTH discharges.; Materials and Methods: N = 1,172 Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans were evaluated between 2005 and 2016 in the multi-site VA Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness, Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) Study of Post-Deployment Mental Health (PDMH Study).; Results: Veterans with OTH discharges constituted 2.7% of our sample, approximating the estimated rate in the overall U.S. veteran population. Compared to veterans discharged under honorable conditions, veterans with OTH discharges were more likely to be younger and have greater odds of reporting family history of drug abuse and depression. Further, veterans with OTH discharges reported a lower level of social support and were more likely to be single, endorse more sleep problems, score higher on measures of drug misuse, have a history of incarceration, and meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. A subsequent matching analysis provided further evidence of the association between OTH discharge and two risk factors: drug misuse and incarceration.; Conclusion: These findings elucidate potential factors associated with veterans with OTH discharges, particularly substance abuse and criminal justice involvement. Results also indicate higher incidence of risk factors that often accompany suicidal ideation and should be a highlighted component of healthcare delivery to this vulnerable cohort of veterans.; ","Elbogen, Eric B.; Wagner, H.

382,Management of nightmares in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder: current perspectives,"Nightmares are considered the hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although the characteristics of these distressing dreams may vary with the type of traumatic event, the pathophysiology exposes central dysfunction of brain structures at the level of the hippocampus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus, modulated by neurochemical imbalance in nor-adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonin pathways. Underlying comorbid conditions, including other sleep disorders, may contribute to worsening symptoms. Addressing sleep disruption can alleviate the severity of these nocturnal events and augment the effectiveness of other PTSD treatments. The expansion of behavioral treatment modalities for PTSD-related nightmares has been encouraging, but the core of these interventions is heavily structured around memory manipulation and imagery rescripting. A lack of a standardized delivery and a high dropout rate continue to pose significant challenges in achieving successful outcomes. The efficacy of existing pharmacological studies, such as Î±-adrenergic blocking agents, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics, has been undermined by methodological limitations and absence of large randomized controlled trials. This review is aimed at reviewing the available treatment strategies for alleviating nightmares in subjects with PTSD. Given the intricate relationship between PTSD and nightmares, future clinical trials have to adopt a more pragmatic approach focused not only on efficacy of novel interventions but also on adjunctive iteration of existing therapies tailored to individual socio-cultural background.; cannabis, cognitive-behavioral therapy, image rehearsal therapy, nightmares, pharmacotherapy, posttraumatic stress disorder, prazosin","El-Solh, Ali A.",0,382
383,Sleep polysomnography as a predictor of recurrence in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder,"Data for baseline clinical variables and 3 nights of sleep polysomnography were examined in 113 depressed children (nâ€‚=â€‚51) and adolescents (nâ€‚=â€‚62) (56 inpatients and 57 outpatients aged 8-18 yrs) where data was available on at least 1 yr of naturalistic follow-up. Ss came from 2 studies of sleep polysomnography in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). Clinical course was assessed using the Kiddie-Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. This interview was used to define recovery from the index episode of MDD and recurrence, a new episode of meeting full criteria for MDD. Clinically, within 1 yr of initial evaluation 102/113 Ss had recovered from their index episode of depression (minimal or no symptoms for 60 d). Of the 102 Ss who recovered, 36 had a recurrence of MDD. The majority of Ss (55%) who had a recurrence were not on medication at the time of recurrence. Ss who had a recurrence were more likely to report suicidal thoughts or attempts at baseline compared to those without a recurrence. On baseline sleep polysomnography, Ss with a later recurrence had decreased sleep efficiency and delayed sleep onset (sleep latencyâ€‚>â€‚10 min). Probability of recurrence at 12 mo was 0.39 compared to 0.15 in Ss with non-delayed sleep onset.

Method: Male and female adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram 10 to 20 mg/day (n = 155) or placebo (n = 157). The primary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to week 8 in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) score using the last observation carried forward approach. Results: A total of 83% patients (259/312) completed 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Mean CDRS-R score at baseline was 57.6 for escitalopram and 56.0 for placebo. Significant improvement was seen in the escitalopram group relative to the placebo group at endpoint in CDRS-R score (-22.1 versus -18.8, p = .022; last observation carried forward). Adverse events occurring in at least 10% of escitalopram patients were headache, menstrual cramps, insomnia, and nausea; only influenza-like symptoms occurred in at least 5% of escitalopram patients and at least twice the incidence of placebo (7.1% versus 3.2%). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 2.6% for escitalopram and 0.6% for placebo. Serious adverse events were reported by 2.6% and 1.3% of escitalopram and placebo patients, respectively, and incidence of suicidality was similar for both groups. Conclusions: In this study, escitalopram was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of depressed adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

385,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine in the treatment of bipolar I and II depression: Improvements in quality of life","Bipolar depression is associated with significant morbidity, high risk of suicide and substantial impairment of health-related quality of life (QOL), which adversely affects family/social relationships and occupational functioning. Depressive symptomatology is the primary determinant of quality of life, and there is a paucity of clinical trial data on how treatments affect quality of life. This 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 542 patients with bipolar I or II depression used the Short Form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire to assess the effect of quetiapine monotherapy, 300 or 600 mg/day, on quality of life. Quality of sleep was also measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Both doses of quetiapine significantly improved quality of life over baseline values in comparison with placebo, which was evident at first assessment (week 4) and continued up to week 8. The improvement in quality of life was consistent over the majority of the Short Form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire domains, and was evident in patients classified as responders on the basis of clinical efficacy measures. Quetiapine therapy also effected a significant improvement in quality of sleep compared with placebo. Improved quality of life may enhance patient compliance, and assessment of quality of life should be incorporated into future clinical trials in bipolar depression.

386,Sensory hypersensitivity predicts reduced sleeping quality in patients with major affective disorders,"The goal of this study was to examine the sensory profile (expressed as hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity) of patients with major affective disorders and its relative contribution to the prediction of sleep quality while considering affective temperaments and depression, which may impact sleep quality. We recruited 176 participants (mean age, 47.3 y), of whom 56.8% had a diagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder and 43.2% a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Reduced sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Affective temperaments were assessed using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego. Sensory hypersensitivity, assessed using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile, significantly distinguished between poor and good sleepers. Sleep quality was mainly predicted by the Beck Depression Inventory-II total score and anxious temperament. Sensory hypersensitivity contributed to this prediction mainly with regard to sleep efficiency and related daytime dysfunction.

387,Mortality among persons with depressive symptoms and among responders and non-responders in a health check-up: An investigation of persons born in 1905 and followed up from age 66 to 75,"9,541 persons born in 1905 were invited in 1971 to participate in a health check-up and to complete a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms to investigate (1) whether death rate among Ss who attended health check-ups was the same as among Ss who did not, (2) whether Ss with depressive symptoms had a higher death rate than Ss without depressive symptoms, and (3) whether suicides and fatal accidents occurred less frequently among Ss who attended health check-ups than among Ss who did not. Another check-up was conducted 3 yrs later, during which a psychiatric examination of 589 Ss was undertaken. Death rates for Ss indicating depression were compared with death rates for remaining Ss, and death rates for Ss with neurotic or sleeping disorders were compared with death rates for Ss without psychiatric symptoms. Results indicate an excess mortality among Ss with depressive symptoms compared to those without. Death rates were significantly higher among Ss that did not participate in health check-ups than among Ss who did. Suicide rates were also greater in nonresponse Ss. None of the Ss who participated in the 2nd health check-up committed suicide.

388,"Association between spousal suicide and mental, physical, and social health outcomes: A longitudinal and nationwide register-based study","Importance: Bereavement after spousal suicide has been linked to mental disorders; however, a comprehensive assessment of the effect of spousal suicide is needed. Objective: To determine whether bereavement after spousal suicide was linked to an excessive risk of mental, physical, and social health outcomes when compared with the general population and spouses bereaved by other manners. Design, setting, and participants: This nationwide, register-based cohort study conducted in Denmark of 6.7 million individuals aged 18 years and older from 1980 to 2014 covered more than 136 million person-years and compared people bereaved by spousal suicide with the general population and people bereaved by other manners of death. Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regressions while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and the presence of mental and physical disorders. Main outcomes and measures: Mental disorders (any disorder, mood, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, and self-harm); physical disorders (cancers, diabetes, sleep disorder, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lower respiratory tract diseases, liver cirrhosis, and spinal disc herniation); causes of mortality (all-cause, natural, unintentional, suicide, and homicide); social health outcomes; and health care use. Results: The total study population included 3 491 939 men, 4814 of whom were bereaved by spousal suicide, and 3 514 959 women, 10 793 of whom were bereaved by spousal suicide. Spouses bereaved by a partnerâ€™s suicide had higher risks of developing mental disorders within 5 years of the loss (men: incidence rate ratio, 1.8; 95%CI, 1.6-2.0; women: incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95%CI, 1.6-1.8) than the general population. Elevated risks for developing physical disorders, such as cirrhosis and sleep disorders, were also noted as well as the use of more municipal support, sick leave benefits, and disability pension funds than the general population. Compared with spouses bereaved by other manners of death, those bereaved by suicide had higher risks for developing mental disorders (men: incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9; women: incidence rate ratio, 2.0; 95%CI, 1.9-2.2), suicidal behaviors, mortality, and municipal support. Additionally, a higher level of mental health care use was noted. Conclusions and relevance: Exposure to suicide is stressful and affects the bereaved spouse on a broad range of outcomes. The excess risks of mental, physical, and social health outcomes highlight a need for more support directed toward spouses bereaved by suicide.

389,Common sense: folk wisdom that ethnobiological and ethnomedical research cannot afford to ignore,"Common sense [CS], especially that of the non-scientist, can have predictive power to identify promising research avenues, as humans anywhere on Earth have always looked for causal links to understand, shape and control the world around them. CS is based on the experience of many individuals and is thus believed to hold some truths. Outcomes predicted by CS are compatible with observations made by whole populations and have survived tests conducted by a plethora of non-scientists. To explore our claim, we provide 4 examples of empirical insights (relevant to probably all ethnic groups on Earth) into causal phenomena predicted by CS: (i) humans must have a sense of time"" (ii) ""at extreme latitudes more people have the winter blues"" (iii) ""sleep is a cure for many ills"" and (iv) ""social networks affect health and disease"".

390,A case of quetiapine XR and divalproex-associated neutropenia followed by successful use of ziprasidone: Comment,"Presents a case report of a 26-year-old White man, suffering from over decreased sleep, increasing irritability, and suicidal statements. In the several days before admission, he had developed distressing delusions about having raped multiple members of his family and killed people as a teen. The patient had been evaluated as an outpatient 3 days before admission and was started on quetiapine as needed, which, according to his family, he was taking about every 8 hours. He was not taking any other medications. Mr H was started on divalproex and quetiapine. On day 2 of admission, a CBC was found to be reduced, but normal, with a white blood cells (WBC) count of 4.5 x 109/L and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 2.52 x 109/L. He was also later started on mirtazapine and clonazepam. He was discharged on quetiapine, divalproex, clonazepam at bed time, and mirtazapine at bed time. As a result on discharge, he was sleeping well, no longer suicidal, and his delusions were decreasing in intensity. It is concluded that Mr H's neutropenia was likely caused by quetiapine or the combination of quetiapine with divalproex. This is supported by the temporal improvement in his WBC count and ANC after quetiapine, the proposed offending agent, was stopped.

The first article investigates the nightmare frequency and frequency of various nightmare topics. The next article develop a new cognitive model of delusions based on four well described cases. The next article suggests that the overactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis may well predict the onset of mood disorders and perhaps even suicidal behavior via abnormalities in the serotonergic system. Another article finds that lithium treatment seems to have an impact on thalamic volumes in patients with bipolar disorder.

Frequent coping mechanisms included changes in activity, interpersonal contact, manipulations of physiological arousal, and attentional control. A high risk of suicide was noted. Coping behaviour appeared somewhat independent of clinical and sociodemographic variables. Successful coping appeared to result from systematic application of widely used coping strategies.

395,Factors associated with suicidal ideation in Taiwanese medical students,"Suicide rates continue to rise all over the world but particularly in adolescents. The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of suicidal ideation among students at a Taiwanese medical school and to identify specific associated factors. Students admitted to National Yang Ming University from 2003 to 2007 were assessed by questionnaire on a number of topics. Students with non-inflammatory joint pain, headache and sleep disorders were all significantly more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation. Students with mental stress, or who had parents with no college degree were significantly more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation. The high rate of suicidal ideation in such a distinguished population is worrisome and is certainly worthy of study and reflection. Previous studies addressing suicide risk in young men and women focused on psychological factors and emotional stress. Our results indicate that a number of factors including physical health and parentsâ€™ education may also be associated with suicidal ideation. Students with non-inflammatory joint pain, headache, and/or sleep disorders should be assessed for depression and suicide risk. Medical schools may also wish to administer mental health screening tools to identify and refer high-risk students for appropriate counseling and assessment.

396,Suicidal ideation in medical students: who is at risk?,"Introduction: Suicide is one of the most tragic problems medical schools are facing today. It is an issue that has not escaped medical schools in either developing or developed nations. To combat this trend, medical educators require efficient and effective strategies for the immediate identification of students who are at an elevated risk of harming themselves.; Materials and Methods: National Yang Ming University medical students were surveyed on various demographic, academic, personal, and extracurricular subjects as well as assessed for suicidal ideation. In addition, students completed the Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ, a translated and modified version of the General Health Questionnaire, GHQ), and the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ, a translated and modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies' Depression Scale, CES-D).; Results: The rate of suicidal ideation was significantly higher in second year students as opposed to fi rst year students (P <0.01). Students of lower socioeconomic status (P = 0.04), with non-inflammatory joint pain (P = 0.02), with headache (P = 0.047), with sleep disorders (P = 0.04), who scored as depressed on the TDQ (P <0.01), and/or who scored abnormally on the CHQ (P <0.01) were all significantly more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation.; Conclusion: A number of groups at high risk for suicidal ideation, and thus in greater need of support, were identified. Suicide intervention programmes and depression counselling should target older students and students of lower socioeconomic status. Students presenting to university clinics with non-inflammatory joint pain, headache, and/or sleep disorders should be evaluated for suicidal tendencies. The TDQ and CHQ are potentially valuable screening tests for early detection of potential suicidal students.;Suicidal Ideation*, Depression/*psychology, Stress, Psychological/*psychology, Students, Medical/*psychology, Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Depression/epidemiology, Female, Humans, Male, Psychometrics, Risk Assessment/methods, Social Class, Statistics as Topic, Stress, Psychological/epidemiology, Surveys and Questionnaires, Young Adult","Fan, Angela P C; Kosik, Russell O; Mandell, Greg A; Tran, Dong Trieu; Cheng, Hao Min; Chen, Chen Huan; Su, Tung-Pying & Chiu, Allen W H",1,396
397,"Disturbed sleep: linking allergic rhinitis, mood and suicidal behavior","Allergic inflammation is associated with mood disorders, exacerbation of depression, and suicidal behavior. Mediators of inflammation modulate sleep , with Th1 cytokines promoting NREM sleep and increasing sleepiness and Th2 cytokines (produced during allergic inflammation) impairing sleep. As sleep impairment is a rapidly modifiable suicide risk factor strongly associated with mood disorders, we review the literature leading to the hypothesis that allergic rhinitis leads to mood and anxiety disorders and an increased risk of suicide via sleep impairment. Specifically, allergic rhinitis can impair sleep through mechanical (obstructive) and molecular (cytokine production) processes. The high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and allergy, the nonabating suicide incidence, the currently available treatment modalities to treat sleep impairment and the need for novel therapeutic targets for mood and anxiety disorders, justify multilevel efforts to explore disturbance of sleep as a pathophysiological link.;Anxiety Disorders/*etiology, Dyssomnias/*complications, Dyssomnias/*etiology, Mood Disorders/*etiology, Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial/*complications, Suicide/*psychology, Anxiety Disorders/psychology, Cytokines/metabolism, Histamine/metabolism, Humans, Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism, Mood Disorders/psychology, Neuropeptides/metabolism, Norepinephrine/metabolism, Orexins, Serotonin/metabolism, Time Factors","Fang, Beverly J; Tonelli, Leonardo H; Soriano, Joseph J & Postolache, Teodor T",0,397
398,"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical characteristics of suicidal ideation in Chinese patients with depression","Background: Suicide risk is greatly increased in depression. Detection of those at risk is clinically important. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and identify independent risk factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) in a widespread symptomatology within and outside DSM framework. Methods: This study was part of the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression (NSSD) which was designed to investigate the magnitude of symptoms of current major depressive episode in China. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the independent risk factors for SI, including variables that are statistically significant in univariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate the performance of the regression model. Results: A total of 3275 patients (1293 males and 1982 females) were included in our analysis. Of these, 1750 patients (53.4%) had SI. Independent risk predictors included crying (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.827), helplessness (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.514), worthlessness (P = 0.001; odds ratio = 1.359), hopelessness (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.805), unusually restless (P = 0.005; odds ratio = 1.276), self-harm (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 3.385), mood-incongruent psychosis (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 2.782), feeling losing control of oneself (P = 0.009; odds ratio = 1.352), hypersomnia (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.805), sensory system complaints (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.546), derealization (P = 0.006; odds ratio = 1.580), guilt (P = 0.002; odds ratio = 1.332), suicidal attempts (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 2.841), male gender (P = 0.001; odds ratio = 0.756), the total course of depression (P = 0.010; odds ratio = 1.003) in the regression model. In addition, the areas under the curve of the ROC and the accuracy for the regression model were 0.80 and 0.76, respectively. Conclusions: This study provided an effective risk model for SI in MDD and indicated that all these factors in our model allow better the employment of preventative measures.

399,The association between somatic symptoms and suicidal ideation in Chinese first-episode major depressive disorder,"Background: Somatic symptoms are prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and often associated with a high risk of suicide. However, which somatic symptoms display as significant risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) is still poorly understood in MDD.; Methods: Two thousand and seventeen Chinese patients with first-episode MDD from the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression were included in this study. A doctor-rating assessment questionnaire was constructed to evaluate depression related somatic symptoms, and stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between somatic symptoms and SI.; Results: Our results showed a high prevalence of current SI in first-episode MDD (50.87%), while no significant gender differences (53.32% vs. 49.26%, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.076) were observed. In addition, patients who have more somatic symptoms would be at the higher risk to elicit SI, and stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that age (Î²â€¯=â€¯-0.020, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001), Pre-verbal physical complaints (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.356, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.001), Sensory system complaints (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.707, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.000), Other pain conditions (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.434, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001), Late insomnia (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.267, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.008), Hypersomnia (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.936, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001), Weight loss (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.272, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.006), Hyposexuality (Î²â€¯=â€¯0.513, Pâ€¯=â€¯PÂ <Â 0.001) were strongly associated with current SI in first-episode Chinese major depression.; Conclusions: Somatic symptoms are strongly associated with SI in first-episode MDD.

401,A 55-year-old man with extreme depression and anxiety: The option for acute suicide risk may not be available to the clinician,"Presents a case report of a 55-yr-old man who was referred for an emergency psychiatric appointment by his psychoanalyst when he became acutely depressed and agitated. The trigger for this crisis was that it had been discovered to have been double-billing the company he had worked for, after he had saved the company from bankruptcy. Upon examination, the patient described severe ruminative anxiety and insomnia, intermittent agitation, and suicidal ideation. Treatment options included: diagnose bipolar disorder and prescribe lithium, recommend hospitalization, prescribe nortriptyline and clonazepam, or refer for electroconvulsive therapy. Because the patient refused to be hospitalized, he was prescribed nortryptiline and clonazepam. Within 2 weeks, he was negotiating with his firm for retirement and had returned to psychotherapy with his previous therapist. He remained stable for at least one year following the crisis.

Isacsson (see record [rid]2003-11012-019[/rid]) on the authors' article (see record [rid]2003-04657-008[/rid]) about risk assessment of inpatient suicide. Drs. Rich and Isacsson correctly point out that there are no data proving that aggressive treatment of severe anxiety symptoms or aggressive pharmacologic management of anxiety, panic, and insomnia prevents suicide. Our assertion is based on repeated findings that these symptoms, in severe form, appear to be present in depressed patients shortly prior to suicide or serious attempts. We agree that aggressive treatment of depression is important for prevention of suicide, but believe the literature indicates that antisuicide effects of antidepressant medications do not come into play in the short term. We believe that our data lead us to the conclusion that antidepressant treatment alone is not enough in patients manifesting severe psychic anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, and severe insomnia and that alcohol use in these situations suggests a tragically ineffective and harmful attempt at self-treatment of these symptoms.

Treatment was administered independently of the study. During the follow-up period, 32 Ss died by suicide. 41% of these suicides occurred within 12 mo of entry into the study, and most had been inpatients. These short-term suicides were associated with panic attacks, severe psychic anxiety, impairment of concentration, psychomotor agitation, global insomnia, moderate alcohol abuse, and severe anhedonia. Fewer than 20% of the suicides occurring more than a year after their enrollment had panic attacks.

The authors agree with Otte and Riemann on the potential importance of sleep disturbances for triggering suicide in epilepsy. Tomson and Hesdorffer suggest that the inclusion of status epilecticus might have overestimated odds of mortality associated with epilepsy. The authors addressed this potential issue in the article by doing a sensitivity analysis of those receiving two or more diagnose and by investigating the effects by diagnostic category of epilepsy. They noted with interest Samokhvalov and Rehm's comments on the importance of alcohol use disorders in epilepsy. Consistent with their findings, alcohol use disorders were indeed more prevalent than other drug use disorders; among patients with substance misuse, 45% had alcohol use disorders only.

408,Cannabis use and the course and outcome of major depressive disorder: A population based longitudinal study,"Cannabis use has been reported to affect the course of various psychiatric disorders, however its effect on the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not yet clear. We used data from Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Individuals with baseline MDD (N = 2,348) were included in the study. Cannabis users without a Cannabis Use Disorder (CUDs) and individuals with a CUD were compared to nonusers using linear and logistic regression analyses controlling for sociodemographics, psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders at baseline. No differences were found in rates of remission between the groups. Level of cannabis use was associated with significantly more depressive symptoms at follow-up, particularly anhedonia, changes in body weight, insomnia or hypersomnia and psychomotor problems. After adjusting for baseline confounding factors, no associations were found between cannabis use and suicidality, functionality and quality of life. We conclude that many of the associations between cannabis use and a more severe course of MDD do not seem to be attributed to cannabis use itself but to associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further longitudinal studies using depression severity indices are required.

409,The link between sleep disturbances and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in remitted bipolar I patients,"Objective We aimed to evaluate the links between different sleep parameters and suicidal ideation and behavior in remitted bipolar I patients. Methods One hundred eight remitted bipolar I patients were recruited from the psychiatry department of Razi Hospital. The third item of the 'Hamilton Depression Rating Scale' was used to evaluate current suicidal behaviors. Circadian typology, daytime sleepiness and sleep quality were evaluated using the 'Horne and Ostberg Morningness‐Eveningness Questionnaire,' the 'Epworth Sleepiness Scale,' and the 'Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,' respectively. Results Current suicidal ideation and behavior were significantly associated with circadian typology, daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality. After controlling for demographic variables (age and gender) and psychosocial factors (depression and substance use), suicidal ideation significantly contributed to sleep quality. Depression was a significant predictor within the second step when entered with other psychosocial variables; however, once suicide variables were included, depression was no longer a significant predictor.

Recall for symptoms of internalizing disorders was worse than recall for symptoms of externalizing disorders. Less than two-thirds of those initially meeting the lifetime depression screening criteria (SGC) provided reports that met the lifetime SGC at follow-up. Significant correlates of SGC recall included history of treatment for any disorder, impairment on the Global Assessment Scale, and the presence of hypersomnia and suicidal symptoms. A prior report of suicidal symptoms was the most important correlate of screen recall.

411,Sleep disturbance as a proximal predictor of suicidal intent in recently hospitalized attempters,"Objectives: Insomnia and short self-reported sleep duration are associated with suicidality, adjusting for concurrent depression. Yet, it is unknown whether they correlate with attempters' suicidal intent and the lethality of suicidal acts. This cross-sectional study in hospitalized suicide attempters aimed to investigate whether temporally proximal self-reported sleep disturbance predicts suicidal intent or exerts mediatory effects. Methods: Attempters were retrospectively assessed for insomnia severity (Athens Insomnia Scale [AIS]) and average night sleep duration (ANSD) for 2 weeks preceding attempt. The effects of insomnia or ANSD on suicidal intent (Beck's Suicide Intent Scale [BSIS]) were explored in multiple regressions. Mediatory effects were investigated in structural equation models (SEMs). Results: A total of 127 adults (59.8% females) were interviewed within two weeks postâ€“suicide attempt. Major psychiatric diagnoses included affective, psychotic, and alcohol-related disorders. Of the participants, 38.6% had current major depression (MDE). A total of 62.2% reported insomnia (AIS â‰¥ 6); 42.5% reported short ANSD (â‰¤ 5 hours). BSIS was predicted by AIS (p = 0.034), short ANSD (p = 0.015), or insomnia with short ANSD (p = 0.006). In SEMs, indirect effects of current MDE, affective disorder, and alcohol-related disorder diagnoses on BSIS via AIS tested significant; both AIS and short ANSD partially mediated the effect of age on BSIS. Conclusion: Insomnia, short ANSD, and, in particular, insomnia with short ANSD proximally predicted suicidal intent in recent attempters. The effects of current depression and affective and alcohol-related disorder diagnoses on suicidal intent were partially mediated by insomnia; both insomnia and short ANSD partially mediated the effect of age on suicidal intent. Therefore, management of sleep disturbance in at-risk subjects is important, as it may reduce unfavorable outcomes of suicidal acts.

412,Safety of varenicline among smokers enrolled in the lung HIV study,"Introduction: The prevalence of smoking is high among the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population, yet there are few studies of tobacco dependence treatment in this population. This paper reports the safety of varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and describes preliminary results about the effectiveness of varenicline versus NRT in HIV-infected smokers. Methods: Participants completed 12 weeks of telephone counseling and either varenicline or NRT. Varenicline was encouraged as the preferred intervention; NRT was used for those unable/unwilling to take varenicline. Adverse events (AEs), related to pharmacotherapy, were monitored. Biochemically confirmed abstinence at 3 months was examined. Inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic regression models was fit to compare participants on varenicline to those on NRT. Results: Among participants on varenicline (n = 118), the most common AEs were nausea, sleep problems, and mood disturbances. One person reported suicidal ideation; there were no cardiovascular complications. There were no differences in the varenicline AE profile between participants on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those not on ART. The percentages of confirmed abstainers were 11.8% in the NRT group and 25.6% in the varenicline group. The odds of being abstinent were 2.54 times as great in the varenicline group compared with the NRT group in the propensity weighted model (95% CI 1.43- 4.49). Conclusions: In this preliminary study, the safety profile of varenicline among HIV-infected smokers resembles findings among smokers without HIV. In addition, varenicline may be more effective at promoting abstinence in this population. Future randomized clinical trials are warranted.

413,Fluvoxamine An updated review of its use in the management of adults with anxiety disorders,"Unlabelled: Fluvoxamine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has little or no effect on other monoamine reuptake mechanisms. Relative to other SSRIs, fluvoxamine is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2. In randomised, double-blind trials. fluvoxamine 100 to 300 mg/day for 6 to 10 weeks significantly reduced symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) compared with placebo. Response rates of 38 to 52% have been reported with fluvoxamine, compared with response rates of 0 to 18% with placebo. In patients with OCD, fluvoxamine had similar efficacy to that of clomipramine and, in smaller trials, the SSRIs paroxetine and citalopram and was significantly more effective than desipramine. Maintenance therapy with fluvoxamine may reduce the likelihood of relapses in up to 67% of patients with OCD. Fluvoxamine < or = 300 mg/day for 6 to 8 weeks was as effective as imipramine in patients with panic disorder, and significantly more effective than placebo. In addition, treatment with fluvoxamine < or = 300 mg/day for > or = 8 weeks improved symptoms of social phobia (social anxiety disorder), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pathological gambling, compulsive buying, trichotillomania, kleptomania, body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorders and autistic disorder. Large trials comparing the efficacy of fluvoxamine and other SSRIs in patients with anxiety disorders are warranted. Fluvoxamine is generally well tolerated; in postmarketing studies, nausea was the only adverse event occurring in >10% of patients with less commonly reported events including somnolence, asthenia, headache, dry mouth and insomnia. Fluvoxamine is associated with a low risk of suicidal behaviour, sexual dysfunction and withdrawal syndrome. Fewer anticholinergic or cardiovascular events are associated with fluvoxamine than tricyclic antidepressants. Although comparative data are lacking, the tolerability profile of fluvoxamine appears to be broadly similar to those of other SSRIs.; Conclusion: Fluvoxamine has demonstrated short term efficacy in the treatment of OCD, panic disorder, social phobia, PTSD and in a range of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. The drug is as effective as clomipramine in patients with OCD but appears to have a better tolerability profile. On the basis of current treatment guidelines, fluvoxamine, like other SSRIs, is recommended as first-line treatment for a number of anxiety disorders. It appears to offer some pharmacokinetic advantages and a different drug interaction profile to the other SSRIs with a broadly similar spectrum of adverse events. However, direct comparisons are required to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of the different agents of this drug class.;Fluvoxamine*/pharmacokinetics, Fluvoxamine*/pharmacology, Fluvoxamine*/therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors*/pharmacokinetics, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors*/pharmacology, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors*/therapeutic use, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*drug therapy, Panic Disorder/*drug therapy, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*drug therapy, Adult, Aged, Drug Interactions, Feeding and Eating Disorders/drug therapy, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Metabolic Clearance Rate, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Figgitt, D P & McClellan, K J",0,413
414,Latent structure of the symptomatology of hospitalized patients with bipolar mania,"Several studies have attempted to understand the dimensions of psychiatric symptoms in manic episodes, but only a few have been able to model the latent structure of mania in bipolar disorder patients using confirmatory factor analysis. The objective of the present study was to search for the best model of the symptomatology of hospitalized manic patients. To achieve this goal, 117 manic inpatients during a manic crisis participated in this research. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted followed by confirmatory factor analysis using an exploratory factor analysis solution and three other theory-based models. The exploratory factor analysis results revealed a six-factor structure: depression, suicide, insomnia, mania, psychosis, and anxiety. This solution also presented the best fit to the data when tested with confirmatory factor analysis. A five-factor solution, without suicide as a separate dimension, appeared to be more theoretically suitable. Another important finding was that anxiety was an independent dimension in mania. Some hypotheses are discussed in light of contemporary theories, and future studies should investigate this aspect further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

415,"Escitalopram in the treatment of adolescent depression: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled extension trial","Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extended efficacy, safety, and tolerability of escitalopram relative to placebo in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Adolescents (12-17 years) who completed an 8-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled, lead-in study of escitalopram 10-20mg versus placebo could enroll in a 16-24-week, multisite extension trial; patients maintained the same lead-in randomization (escitalopram or placebo) and dosage (escitalopram 10 or 20 mg/day, or placebo) during the extension. The primary efficacy was Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) change from the leadin study baseline to treatment week 24 (8-week lead-in study plus 16-week extension); the secondary efficacy was Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score at week 24. All efficacy analyses used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach; sensitivity analyses used observed cases (OC) and mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). Safety was evaluated via adverse event (AE) reports and the clinician-rated Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Results: Following lead-in, 165 patients enrolled in the double-blind extension (82 placebo; 83 escitalopram); 40 (48.8%) placebo and 37 (44.6%) escitalopram patients completed treatment. CDRS-R total score improvement was significantly greater for escitalopram than for placebo (p = 0.005, LOCF; p = 0.014; MMRM). Response rates (CDRS-R â‰¥ 40% reduction from baseline [adjusted and unadjusted] and CGI-I â‰¤ 2) were significantly higher for escitalopram than for placebo (LOCF); remission rates (CDRS-R â‰¤ 28) were 50.6% for escitalopram and 35.7% for placebo (p = 0.002). OC analyses were not significantly different between groups. The most frequent escitalopram AEs (â‰¥ 5% and more frequent than placebo) were headache, nausea, insomnia, vomiting, influenza-like symptoms, diarrhea, and urinary tract infection. Most AEs were mild/ moderate and not related to the study drug. AEs suggestive of self-harm occurred in 5.7% and 7.1% of placebo and escitalopram patients. Occurrence of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation assessed by C-SSRS was 10.9% (14/128) for placebo and 14.5% (19/131) for escitalopram. Conclusions: Extended use of escitalopram was generally safe and resulted in modest improvement in efficacy in adolescents with MDD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

416,Validation of the telephone-administered PHQ-9 against the in-person administered SCID-I major depression module,"Background: We assessed item-to-item correspondence between the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) major depression episode portion of the major depressive module. Method: Four hundred and ninety-eight soldiers in the Ohio National Guard were administered the PHQ-9 and SCID-I. Data were analyzed using chi-square analyses, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and diagnostic efficiency statistics. Results: To screen for depression effectively, results indicate use of the cardinal first two items, items representing fatigue, appetite and sleep changes with an item level cut-off point of two, and the item representing suicidal ideation with item level cut-off point of one. Further, total PHQ-9 scores significantly predicted SCID-I major depressive episode (MDE) and diagnosis (MDD) with moderate accuracy. Lastly, the cut-off total score of 10 had the optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity compared to other PHQ-9 scoring options. Limitations: Differences in timeline of administration of the measures, differences in â€œworst episodeâ€ reference between the measures, and use of a specific military population are some of the limitations. Conclusions: This validation study provides guidelines for the use of the telephone-administered PHQ-9 in assessing the lifetime prevalence of a major depressive episode and diagnosis in non-clinical populations, with implications for clinical use.

417,Syncope and hyperCKemia as minimal manifestations of short CTG repeat expansions in myotonic dystrophy type 1,"Introduction: Syncope and palpitations as the only initial manifestations of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (MD1) due to a CTG expansion of 50-100 repeats have not been reported.; Case Report: In a 55-year-old female with a family history of MD1 and a personal history of a single syncope, palpitations, and hyperCKemia, 70 CTG repeats were detected in the DMPK gene. Her brother had presented atypical clinical, electromyographic, and muscle biopsy features since the age of 35 but had been diagnosed with MD1 after he later developed typical distal myotonia. He died suddenly during an episode of syncope at the age of 53. A sister with clinical myotonia died suddenly during sleep at the age of 45 and a second sister with quadriparesis died from complications of intestinal rupture at age 52. A third sister committed suicide at age 40 after developing recurrent syncopes, while a fourth sister had hyperCKemia and foot-extensor weakness. The mother of these five affected children died suddenly from myocardial rupture.; Conclusions: MD1 with <100 CTG repeats may exclusively manifest cardiologically. Family screening for MD1 is important even in asymptomatic patients. MD1 may initially manifest without typical features, while muscle biopsy may be misleading and indicate glycogenosis. Close cardiac follow-up is important if MD1 manifests cardiologically to prevent syncope or sudden cardiac death.; Copyright Â© 2014 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

418,Agitation as a moderator of the relationship between insomnia and current suicidal ideation in the military,"Research has established a link between agitation and insomnia, both of which are considered to be risk factors for suicide. The present study aimed to investigate the moderating role of agitation within the relationship between insomnia and current suicidal ideation in a sample of U.S. military personnel. Consistent with hypotheses, the relationship between insomnia and current suicidal ideation was significant only at high levels of agitation. Results support previous findings indicating that both insomnia and agitation are suicide risk factors. These findings clarify the role of known risk factors in the pathway to suicide and may contribute to the advancement of suicide detection and prevention, as these factors may be more easily identified in individuals unwilling to admit thoughts of death and suicide, such as many military personnel.

419,Physical health and suicide in late life: An evaluative review,"A review of the empirical literature shows that physical illness increases risk for suicide late in life. Conditions that confer risk include cancer, some neurological disorders (including seizure and possibly cognitive impairment, but not Parkinsonâ€™s disease or stroke), chronic pulmonary disorder, incontinence, renal failure, hearing or vision impairment, insomnia, and congestive heart failure. Nonetheless, most physically ill older adults do not die by suicide. The extent to which risks are explained by depression, disability, and pain remains to be evaluated. Depression outweighs physical illness as a risk factor for suicide in late life. Clinicians should routinely assess for depression as well as suicide risk in physically ill older adults.

420,Depression in older adults,"Depression is less prevalent among older adults than among younger adults, but it can have serious consequences. More than half of cases represent a first onset in later life. Although suicide rates in the elderly are declining, they are still higher than in younger adults and are more closely associated with depression. Depressed older adults are less likely to endorse affective symptoms and more likely to display cognitive changes, somatic symptoms, and loss of interest than are depressed younger adults. Risk factors leading to the development of late-life depression likely comprise complex interactions among genetic vulnerabilities, cognitive diathesis, age-associated neurobiological changes, and stressful events. Insomnia is an often overlooked risk factor for late-life depression. We suggest that a common pathway to depression in older adults, regardless of which predisposing risks are most prominent, may be curtailment of daily activities. Accompanying self-critical thinking may exacerbate and maintain a depressed state. Offsetting the increasing prevalence of certain risk factors in late life are age-related increases in psychological resilience. Other protective factors include higher education and socioeconomic status, engagement in valued activities, and religious or spiritual involvement. Treatments including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive bibliotherapy, problem-solving therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and life review/reminiscence therapy are effective but are too infrequently used with older adults. Preventive interventions including education for individuals with chronic illness, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving skills training, group support, and life review have also received support.

421,Teen sleep and suicidality: results from the youth risk behavior surveys of 2007 and 2009,"Study Objectives: Suicide in the adolescent population is a tragic and preventable cause of death. Previous studies have confirmed both long and short total sleep times (TSTs) are associated with suicidal ideation in the adult population. We hypothesized that both long and short TSTs are risk factors for serious suicide attempt in the adolescent population as well.; Methods: We tested this hypothesis using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 2007 and 2009, which consist of school-based, nationally representative samples (N = 12,154 for 2007, N = 14,782 for 2009). Logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between suicidality and sleep after adjusting for confounders including age, sex, race/ethnicity, feelings of sadness, and substance abuse.; Results: Of the total sample, roughly 15% reported suicidal ideation, 10% planned suicide, 5% attempted and 2% reported an attempt requiring treatment. Teens who reported sleeping â‰¤ 5 or â‰¥ 10 h had a significantly higher risk for suicidality compared to those with a TST of 8 h. The largest odds ratios were found among the most severe forms of suicidality (attempt requiring treatment) with an odds ratio of 5.9 for a TST â‰¤ 4 h and 4.7 for a TST â‰¥ 10 h.; Conclusion: Both short and long TSTs are risk factors for suicidality among teens and extremes in TST may indicate more serious suicidality. Self-reported sleep duration may be a useful screening question for suicide risk. Future studies should examine whether sleep duration is a causal and/or modifiable risk factor for suicidality in teens.;Sleep*, Adolescent Behavior/*psychology, Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Age Distribution, Child, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Logistic Models, Male, Odds Ratio, Risk-Taking, Sex Distribution, Suicide/prevention & control, Suicide/psychology, Suicide, Attempted/prevention & control, Surveys and Questionnaires, Time Factors, United States, Suicide, child and adolescent psychiatry, epidemiology, sleep","Fitzgerald, Caris T; Messias, Erick & Buysse, Daniel J",1,421
422,Health effects three years after potential exposure to the toxic contaminants of an electrical transformer fire,"A medical surveillance program has been established for 482 persons who were potentially exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins, and dibenzofurans from an electrical transformer fire in a Binghamton, NY office building in 1981. Vital Record and Cancer Registry data, medical records, and mail questionnaires were used to assess mortality, symptomatology, cancer incidence, and reproductive events through 1984. The numbers of deaths, cancers, fetal deaths, and infants with low birth weight or congenital malformations were similar to those expected on the basis of age- and sex-specific rates for upstate New York and other comparison populations. Two suicides were observed compared with 0.31 expected, but the difference was not statistically significant. After adjustment for possible confounders, persons with the greatest degree of potential exposure were significantly more likely than those with less exposure to report unexplained weight loss (relative risk [RR] = 12.80), muscle pain (RR = 5.07), frequent coughing (RR = 4.14), skin color changes (RR = 3.49), and nervousness or sleep problems (RR = 3.19). The possibility of recall bias and the intervening effects of stress, however, weaken the conclusion that toxic chemicals caused the symptomatology. Exposure-related systemic disorders, e.g., chloracne or peripheral neuropathy, were not diagnosed by personal physicians; however, some persons refused to release their medical records because of ongoing litigation.

423,Depression in men: Issues for practice and research,"This column discusses issues for practice and research related to depression in men. Depression in men is not uncommon and often goes unrecognized and untreated. Research has shown that while men develop the standard symptoms of depression, they often experience it differently and may have different ways of coping than women. Men may be more willing to report fatigue, irritability, loss of interest in work or hobbies, and sleep disturbances, rather than feelings of sadness, worthlessness, and excessive guilt. Depression also puts men at risk for suicide. Clinicians are faced with a wide range of problems. As with researchers, the first step is accurate assessment and diagnosis of depression. For instance, with some disorders, such as mood disorders, there is a high probability of misdiagnosis as schizophrenia among African Americans because of differences in how symptoms of emotional distress are expressed. There also are societal barriers to treatment, such as lack of health insurance, poor quality care, and a lack of culturally competent care. While insurance plays a large role in gaining access to health care, culture and language also are significant barriers.

424,Web-based intervention to improve quality of life in late stage bipolar disorder (ORBIT): Randomised controlled trial protocol,"Background: The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to establish the effectiveness of a novel online quality of life (QoL) intervention tailored for people with late stage (â‰¥ 10 episodes) bipolar disorder (BD) compared with psychoeducation. Relative to early stage individuals, this late stage group may not benefit as much from existing psychosocial treatments. The intervention is a guided self-help, mindfulness based intervention (MBI) developed in consultation with consumers, designed specifically for web-based delivery, with email coaching support. Methods/design: This international RCT will involve a comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two 5-week adjunctive online self-management interventions: Mindfulness for Bipolar 2.0 and an active control (Psychoeducation for Bipolar). A total of 300 participants will be recruited primarily via social media channels. Main inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of BD (confirmed via a phone-administered structured diagnostic interview), no current mood episode, history of 10 or more mood episodes, no current psychotic features or active suicidality, under the care of a medical practitioner. Block randomisation will be used for allocation to the interventions, and participants will retain access to the program for 6 months. Evaluations will be conducted at pre- and post- treatment, and at 3- and 6- months follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale (Brief QoL.BD), collected immediately post-intervention at 5 weeks (T1). Secondary measures include BD-related symptoms (mania, depression, anxiety, stress), time to first relapse, functioning, sleep quality, social rhythm stability and resource use. Measurements will be collected online and via telephone assessments at baseline (T0), 5 weeks (T1), three months (T2) and six months (T3). Candidate moderators (diagnosis, anxiety or substance comorbidities, demographics and current treatments) will be investigated as will putative therapeutic mechanisms including mindfulness, emotion regulation and self-compassion. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. Acceptability and any unwanted events (including adverse treatment reactions) will be documented and explored. Discussion: This definitive trial will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel QoL focused, mindfulness based, online guided self-help intervention for late stage BD, and investigate its putative mechanisms of therapeutic action.

425,"Immigration, Work, and Health: A Literature Review of Immigration Between Mexico and the United States","Understanding the influence someone's job or career has on their health goes beyond the physical, emotional and social hazards, risks and conditions that they face at work. One's job or career also exerts a significant influence over other aspects of life that contribute or detract from their health and that of their family. Work is the major incentive for Latin American migration to the United States. Latino immigrants experience increasingly poorer outcomes for physical health and chronic diseases the longer they remain in the U.S. The strong link between work and immigration suggests that, for many Latin Americans, immigration can be understood as a career path which puts them, and their family members, in situations that can change their physical, emotional, and social health as a condition of their employment. Given the large number of Latin Americans who emigrate for work, it is essential that the unique physical, mental and social impacts of emigration are accounted for when working with clients impacted by emigration at the individual, family and community level as well as those social workers practicing at the system level. This paper is a literature review that explores the impact that emigrating for work has on the health of those that emigrate and their family members that stay behind.; ","Flynn, Michael A.; CarreÃ³n, Tania; Eggerth, Donald E. & Johnson, Antoinette I.",0,425

Method: Logistic regression analyses were conducted with minor depression alone and also adjusting for anxiety, sociodemographic, and medical variables, with MDD as the outcome variable. Also, among those with minor depression, depressive symptom categories were studied with both logistic regression and population attributable risk (PAR) to determine if they predicted MDD. Results: Individuals with a history of minor depression had an odds ratio of more than 5 of having a first lifetime episode of MDD (adjusted OR: 5.37, 95% CI: 2.87, 10.06). Suicidal ideation, appetite/weight issues, and sleep difficulty had the highest PARs. Conclusion: Minor depression strongly predicts MDD. Clinical and public health interventions for individuals with minor depression can potentially impact the pathway leading to MDD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

427,Proposal for a short version of the Beck Hopelessness Scale based on a national representative survey in Hungary,"In our study we assessed the frequency of reported hopelessness and suicide attempts in the national representative survey Hungarostudy 2002. The randomly selected sample consisted of 14,000 individuals over the age of 18. We created a short version of the widely used Beck Hopelessness Scale for screening purposes in suicide prevention. The short version of the BHS consists of four items and has high internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s alpha = 0.85). Moreover, we conducted an investigation into psychological, somatic, sociological and socio-economic as well as cultural variables that show a positive or negative correlation with hopelessness and important predictors of suicide. The following psychological variables showing a positive correlation with hopelessness were identified: dysfunctional attitudes, exhaustion, psychological distress, hostility, lack of life goals and inability to cope emotionally. Sense of coherence, social support, perceived self-efficiency, subjective well-being and problem-solving coping showed a negative correlation with hopelessness. Concerning the relationship between hopelessness and suicide attempts, we found that participants who attempted suicide in the last year scored higher (mean = 4.86) than participants who attempted suicide more than 3 years ago (mean = 3.57). These results indicate that applying the short version of the BHS could be very useful in general practice and in psychiatric care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Medical treatment is only considered in severe cases with persistent and extended symptoms where there is a high risk of self-injury. We report the case of a 12-year-old boy with severe night terrors and somnambulism whose symptoms completely remitted under medication with the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor paroxetine. Its impact on sleep remains unclear as we were not able to show any significant changes in the polysomnographic sleep macroarchitecture. Paroxetine might be an alternative to benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants because it permits subchronic medication, necessitates little dose titration and is well tolerated, with few side-effects, and, in particular, has low sedating properties.; Somnambulism Paroxetine Night Terrors Polysomnography","FrÃ¶lich Alfred Wiater Gerd Lehmkuhl, J.",0,428
429,Suicidal ideations and sleeprelated problems in early adolescence,"Aims: Suicidal ideation and sleep-related problems are associated with many common psychopathological entities in early adolescence. This study examined possible association between suicidal ideation and sleep-related problems. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in classroom settings at 840 early adolescents 11-13 years of age. Of those, 791 adolescents fully completed the data and thus represent an actual sample. Suicidal ideations were assessed with three dichotomous (yes/no) items: â€˜I often think about deathâ€™; â€˜I wish I was deadâ€™; â€˜I often think about suicide.â€™ A composite measure of perceived sleep-related problems was formed by combining items from the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Do you find it hard to sleep at night because you are worrying about things?), Children Depression Inventory (It is hard for me to fall asleep at night), and two additional dichotomous questions (I often was not able to fall asleep because of worrying; At times I was not able to stay asleep because of worrying). This score mainly assessed difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Results: A total of 7.1% adolescents reported suicidal ideation and 86.7% of them had sleep problems. Sleep-related problems were associated with any suicidal ideation and each type of ideation separately. Conclusion: This study suggests association of sleep problems and suicidal ideations in early adolescence. Therefore, clinicians should evaluate this population for sleep disturbances, as they might be a marker of increased risk for suicidality.

430,Tetrabenazine as anti-chorea therapy in Huntington disease: an open-label continuation study Huntington Study Group/TETRA-HD Investigators,"Background: Tetrabenazine (TBZ) selectively depletes central monoamines by reversibly binding to the type-2 vesicular monoamine transporter. A previous double blind study in Huntington disease (HD) demonstrated that TBZ effectively suppressed chorea, with a favorable short-term safety profile (Neurology 2006;66:366-372). The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of TBZ for chorea in HD.; Methods: Subjects who completed the 13-week, double blind protocol were invited to participate in this open label extension study for up to 80 weeks. Subjects were titrated to the best individual dose or a maximum of 200 mg/day. Chorea was assessed using the Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale.; Results: Of the 75 participants, 45 subjects completed 80 weeks. Three participants terminated due to adverse events (AEs) including depression, delusions with associated previous suicidal behavior, and vocal tics. One subject died due to breast cancer. The other 26 subjects chose not to continue on with each ensuing extension for various reasons. When mild and unrelated AEs were excluded, the most commonly reported AEs (number of subjects) were sedation/somnolence (18), depressed mood (17), anxiety (13), insomnia (10), and akathisia (9). Parkinsonism and dysarthria [corrected] scores were significantly increased at week 80 compared to baseline. At week 80, chorea had significantly improved from baseline with a mean reduction in the TMC score of 4.6 (SD 5.5) units. The mean dosage at week 80 was 63.4 mg (range 12.5-175 mg).; Conclusions: TBZ effectively suppresses HD-related chorea for up to 80 weeks.

431,Safety of converting from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea,"Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however, tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Innervations: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntingtonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.

433,Nursing diagnoses related to psychiatric adult inpatient care,"Aims and objectives: To detect the prevalence of NDA-I diagnoses and possible relationships between those and patient characteristics such as gender, age, medical diagnoses and psychiatric specialty/setting. Background: There is a lack on studies about psychiatric inpatient characteristics and possible relationships among these characteristics with nursing diagnoses. Design: A quantitative-descriptive, cross-sectional, completed data sampling study was performed. Methods: The data were collected from the electronic patient record system. Frequencies for the social-demographic data, the prevalence of the NDA-I diagnoses and the explanatory variables were calculated. Results: In total, 410 nursing phenomena were found representing 85 different NDA-I diagnoses in 312 patients. The NDA-I diagnosis 'Ineffective Coping' was the most frequently stated diagnosis followed by 'Ineffective Health Maintenance,' 'Hopelessness' and 'Risk for Other-Directed Violence'. Men were more frequently affected by the diagnoses 'Ineffective Coping,' 'Hopelessness,' 'Risk for Self- Directed Violence,' 'Defensive Coping' and 'Risk for Suicide,' whereas the diagnoses 'Insomnia,' 'Chronic Confusion,' 'Chronic Low Self-Esteem' and 'Anxiety' were more common in women. Patients under the age of 45 years were more frequently affected by 'Chronic Low Self-Esteem' and 'Anxiety' than older patients. 'Ineffective Coping' was the most prevalent diagnosis by patients with mental disorders due to psychoactive substance use. Patients with schizophrenia were primarily affected by the diagnoses 'Ineffective Coping,' 'Impaired Social Interaction' and 'Chronic Low Self-Esteem.' Conclusions: This study demonstrates the complexity and diversity of nursing care in inpatient psychiatric settings. Patientsâ€™ gender, age and psychiatric diagnoses and settings are a key factor for specific nursing diagnosis. Relevance to clinical practice: There are tendencies for relationships between certain nursing diagnosis and patient characteristics in psychiatric adult inpatients. This enhances the specific, extended knowledge for nursing care and its demands in this setting and therefore supports the daily nursing psychiatric care and its needs.

434,Patient and provider priorities for self-reported domains of HIV clinical care,"We sought to understand how HIV-infected patients, their providers, and HIV care researchers prioritize self-reported domains of clinical care. Participants rank-ordered two lists of domains. A modified Delphi process was used for providers and researchers. Approximately 25% of patients were interviewed to discuss rationale for rank order choices. List 1 included anger, anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical function, pain, and sleep disturbance. List 2 included alcohol abuse, cognitive function, HIV stigma, HIV and treatment symptoms, medication adherence, positive affect, sexual risk behavior, sexual function, social roles, spirituality/meaning of life, and substance abuse. Seventy-four providers, 80 HIV care researchers, and 66 patients participated. Patients ranked context-based domains, such as HIV stigma, more highly than providers, while health behaviors, such as drug or alcohol use, ranked lower. Patients described a need to address wider-context challenges such as HIV stigma in order to positively impact health behaviors. Divergent patient and provider priorities highlight the importance of incorporating views from all stakeholders and suggests the need for a care approach that more effectively addresses contextual barriers to adverse health behaviors.; Attitude of Health Personnel*, Medication Adherence*, Patient Acceptance of Health Care*, Self Report*, Social Stigma*, HIV Infections/*therapy, Adult, Female, HIV Infections/psychology, Health Behavior, Humans, Interviews as Topic, Male, Middle Aged, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Risk-Taking, United States, HIV care, HIV-infected patients, patient-based measures, patient-reported outcomes, patientâ€“provider communication","Fredericksen, Rob J.; Edwards, Todd C.; Merlin, Jessica S.; Gibbons, Laura E.; Rao, Deepa; Batey, D.

435,Concomitants of paranoia in the general population,"Background: Paranoia is an unregarded but pervasive attribute of human populations. In this study we carried out the most comprehensive investigation so far of the demographic, economic, social and clinical correlates of self-reported paranoia in the general population. Method: Data weighted to be nationally representative were analysed from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England (APMS 2007; n = 7281). Results: The prevalence of paranoid thinking in the previous year ranged from 18.6% reporting that people were against them, to 1.8% reporting potential plots to cause them serious harm. At all levels, paranoia was associated with youth, lower intellectual functioning, being single, poverty, poor physical health, poor social functioning, less perceived social support, stress at work, less social cohesion, less calmness, less happiness, suicidal ideation, a great range of other psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, worry, phobias, post-traumatic stress and insomnia), cannabis use, problem drinking and increased use of treatment and services. Conclusions: Overall, the results indicate that paranoia has the widest of implications for health, emotional well-being, social functioning and social inclusion. Some of these concomitants may contribute to the emergence of paranoid thinking, while others may result from it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

436,Depression sum-scores don't add up: why analyzing specific depression symptoms is essential,"Most measures of depression severity are based on the number of reported symptoms, and threshold scores are often used to classify individuals as healthy or depressed. This method--and research results based on it--are valid if depression is a single condition, and all symptoms are equally good severity indicators. Here, we review a host of studies documenting that specific depressive symptoms like sad mood, insomnia, concentration problems, and suicidal ideation are distinct phenomena that differ from each other in important dimensions such as underlying biology, impact on impairment, and risk factors. Furthermore, specific life events predict increases in particular depression symptoms, and there is evidence for direct causal links among symptoms. We suggest that the pervasive use of sum-scores to estimate depression severity has obfuscated crucial insights and contributed to the lack of progress in key research areas such as identifying biomarkers and more efficacious antidepressants. The analysis of individual symptoms and their causal associations offers a way forward. We offer specific suggestions with practical implications for future research.;Depression/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Depression/drug therapy, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy, Humans, Risk Factors","Fried, Eiko I & Nesse, Randolph M",0,436
437,Self-concealment and suicidal behaviors,"Understanding self-concealment, the tendency to actively conceal distressing personal information from others, may be important in developing effective ways to help individuals with suicidal ideation. No published study has yet assessed the relation between self-concealment and suicidal behaviors. Additionally, most self-concealment research has been conducted solely with younger adults. The relation between self-concealment and depressive symptoms among older adults (age 65 and older), and between self-concealment and suicidal behaviors among both younger (college student) and older adults, was investigated in this study. As predicted, self-concealment was significantly related to suicidal behaviors in younger adults. Furthermore, self-concealment was significantly related to depressive symptoms in older adults. Interestingly, the association between self-concealment and suicidal behaviors in this age group was not significant.; Â© 2012 The American Association of Suicidology.Suicidal Ideation*, Privacy/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Depression/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Self-Injurious Behavior/psychology, Southeastern United States, Surveys and Questionnaires, Young Adult","Friedlander, Adam; Nazem, Sarra; Fiske, Amy; Nadorff, Michael R. & Smith, Merideth D.",1,437
438,"Late-life depression: psychopathology, medical interventions, and dental implications","Background: Late-life depression (LLD) initially occurs after age 65 years and is a major public health concern because the elderly who are at high risk constitute an ever-expanding segment of the population. LLD is a mental illness in which mood, thought content, and behavioral patterns are impaired, causing the individual distress, compromising social function, and impairing self-maintenance skills (eg, bathing, dressing, hygiene). LLD characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities and may be accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty in concentration, and a high suicide rate. Diagnosis of LLD is sometimes complicated by a denial of mood change and an inability to distinguish symptoms of a concurrent physical illness from those of a depressive etiology. The disorder is most frequently treated with antidepressant medications, and although older individuals have a recovery rate that is comparable with younger adults, they often take longer to recover, have more frequent relapses, and are more sensitive to the side effects of the drugs.; Clinical Implications: Individuals undergoing treatment for LLD and those whose illness has not been diagnosed or treated often are seen with significant oral disease by the dentist. Dentists need to be cognizant of how to safely and compassionately provide care to those already receiving mental health services. They must also be familiar with the psychiatric symptoms of the disorder to effectuate a timely referral to a physician of those with occult or relapsing disease. LLD is frequently associated with a disinterest in oral hygiene, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental decay, advanced periodontal disease, and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management necessitates a vigorous preventive dental education program, the use of artificial salivary products, antiseptic mouthwash, daily fluoride mouth rinse, and special precautions in administration of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors and prescription of analgesics.; Conclusion: Dentists who invoke appropriate precautions can usually provide a full range of services to individuals with LLD, thereby enhancing patient self-esteem and contributing to the psychotherapeutic aspect of management.;Depression/*psychology, Mouth Diseases/*etiology, Tooth Diseases/*etiology, Activities of Daily Living, Affect, Aged, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Dental Caries/etiology, Dental Caries/prevention & control, Depression/drug therapy, Depression/physiopathology, Diet, Cariogenic, Humans, Oral Hygiene, Patient Education as Topic, Periodontal Diseases/etiology, Periodontal Diseases/prevention & control, Sensation Disorders/etiology, Sensation Disorders/prevention & control, Social Behavior, Stress, Psychological/psychology, Thinking, Xerostomia/etiology, Xerostomia/therapy","Friedlander, Arthur H & Norman, Dean C",0,438

440,Somatic comorbidity and other factors related to suicide attempt among Polish methadone maintenance patients,"Objectives: Fatal and nonfatal suicide attempts are far more common in opioid-dependent individuals than in the general population. More research is needed to understand the specific risk factors for suicidal behaviors in this patient population, particularly outside of the United States and Western Europe. This study investigated the correlates of suicide attempts among Polish patients in methadone maintenance treatment and interpreted results in the context of findings from other countries. Methods: The study was based on a sample of 240 individuals recruited from a methadone maintenance clinic in Poland. Participants were interviewed using standardized measures. Results: Consistent with studies in other countries, sexual abuse, depression, alcohol dependence, and impulsivity were associated with suicide attempt. Additionally, those patients with somatic comorbidity had an increase in odds (odds ratio = 2.6) of suicide attempt. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest a potential benefit to treatment approaches that address somatic concerns of methadone maintenance patients. More research is needed to identify, assess, and understand possible cultural and regional differences between opioid-dependent populations to better tailor prevention strategies.

442,Burns in a suicide attempt related to psychiatric side effects of interferon,"A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our critical care center after pouring lamp oil on herself and setting herself on fire. Diagnosed with chronic hepatitis, she had received interferon-alpha at another hospital. During interferon therapy she developed anxiety, irritability, sleeplessness, and depression. At our hospital she underwent fluid resuscitation according to the method of Baxter. After treatment with topical cream and ointment, she underwent skin grafting. Interferon was not given. After discharge, wound healing proved satisfactory. She was intelligent and insightful, and her mental condition remained stable with no apparent emotional problems. As she had no significant past medical or psychiatric history and no history of substance abuse, we believe that her depression was a side effect of interferon therapy. A number of reports have described depression and other psychiatric disorders associated with interferon, but none of these accounts have concerned burns sustained in suicide attempts. This case underscores the potential seriousness of adverse reactions to interferon characterized by emotional disturbance and also illustrates that physicians who treat burn patients need to have an understanding of affective disorders and unusual side effects of medication.; Suicide, Attempted*, Antiviral Agents/*adverse effects, Burns/*etiology, Depression/*chemically induced, Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects, Burns/drug therapy, Burns/surgery, Depression/complications, Depression/psychology, Female, Fires, Follow-Up Studies, Hepatitis C/therapy, Humans, Middle Aged, Ointments/therapeutic use, Self Mutilation/psychology, Skin Transplantation","Fukunishi, K.; Tanaka, H.; Maruyama, J.; Takahashi, H.; Kitagishi, H.; Ueshima, T.; Maruyama, K. & Sakata, I.",0,442
443,The tide does turn: Predictors of remission from suicidal ideation and attempt among Canadians who previously attempted suicide,"The objectives of this study were to identify factors that contribute to (1) remission from suicidal ideation, and (2) remission from suicide attempt, among Canadians with a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Data for this study came from Statistics Canada's nationally representative 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health. A sample of 769 adult respondents who had ever attempted suicide was analyzed with remission from past year suicidal ideation and remission from past year suicide attempt as outcome variables. Of the 769 respondents who had ever attempted suicide, more than two-thirds (69%) were free from suicidal ideation within the past year, and approximately 87% were free from suicide attempts within the past year. Compared to men, odds were 2.66 times greater for women to be free of suicide attempt and 2.65 times greater to be free of suicidal ideation in the past year. Older age, being free of sleep problems and major depressive episode, having no history of chronic childhood physical abuse, and having two or fewer previous suicide attempts were associated with higher odds of remission from both suicide attempt and ideation in the past year","Fuller-Thomson E; West KJ; Baiden P,",0,443
444,Prevalence of major and minor depression in elderly persons with mild cognitive impairment - MADRS factor analysis,"Objective: The aim of the study was to detect the prevalence of depressive syndromes and symptoms in the sample of elderly persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and to analyse Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating (MADRS) item scores. Method: The subjects of the study were 102 consecutive out-patients with MCI. All subjects were assessed by an experienced psychiatrist and MADRS was applied. Major and minor depressive episodes were defined according to DSM-IV criteria. Factor analysis was used to analyse baseline MADRS item scores. Results: Three patient groups emerged according to the depressive symptoms distribution and severity scores basis: those with major depression constituted 19.6%(n = 20), with minor depression 26.5% (n = 27), and with very few depressive symptoms 53.9% (n = 55). Three interpretable MADRS factors were identified, using the factor analysis with Varimax rotation: the first consisting of apparent and reported sadness, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, the second consisting of inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, suicidal thoughts, and the third with concentration difficulties and lassitude. Conclusions: It was concluded that both major and minor depression is common in MCI. Three MADRS factors were identified and labelled as anhedonia-pessimism, anxiety-vegetative, and cognitive-inhibition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

445,"Effects of low-dose, controlled-release, phentermine plus topiramate combination on weight and associated comorbidities in overweight and obese adults (CONQUER): A randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial","Background: Obesity is associated with a reduction in life expectancy and an increase in mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other causes. We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of two doses of phentermine plus topiramate controlled-release combination as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle modification for weight loss and metabolic risk reduction in individuals who were overweight and obese, with two or more risk factors. Methods: In this 56-week phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned overweight or obese adults (aged 18-70 years), with a body-mass index of 27-45 kg/mÂ² and two or more comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes or prediabetes, or abdominal obesity) to placebo, once-daily phentermine 7Â·5 mg plus topiramate 46Â·0 mg, or once-daily phentermine 15Â·0 mg plus topiramate 92Â·0 mg in a 2:1:2 ratio in 93 centres in the USA. Drugs were administered orally. Patients were randomly assigned by use of a computer-generated algorithm that was implemented through an interactive voice response system, and were stratified by sex and diabetic status. Investigators, patients, and study sponsors were masked to treatment. Primary endpoints were the percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of patients achieving at least 5% weight loss. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00553787. Findings: Of 2487 patients, 994 were assigned to placebo, 498 to phentermine 7Â·5 mg plus topiramate 46Â·0 mg, and 995 to phentermine 15Â·0 mg plus topiramate 92Â·0 mg; 979, 488, and 981 patients, respectively, were analysed. At 56 weeks, change in bodyweight was âˆ’1Â·4 kg (least-squares mean âˆ’1Â·2%, 95% CI âˆ’1Â·8 to âˆ’0Â·7), âˆ’8Â·1 kg (âˆ’7Â·8%, âˆ’8Â·5 to âˆ’7Â·1; p < 0Â·0001), and âˆ’10Â·2 kg (âˆ’9Â·8%, âˆ’10Â·4 to âˆ’9Â·3; p < 0Â·0001) in the patients assigned to placebo, phentermine 7Â·5 mg plus topiramate 46Â·0 mg, and phentermine 15Â·0 mg plus topiramate 92Â·0 mg, respectively. 204 (21%) patients achieved at least 5% weight loss with placebo, 303 (62%; odds ratio 6Â·3, 95% CI 4Â·9 to 8Â·0; p < 0Â·0001) with phentermine 7Â·5 mg plus topiramate 46Â·0 mg, and 687 (70%; 9Â·0, 7Â·3 to 11Â·1; p < 0Â·0001) with phentermine 15Â·0 mg plus topiramate 92Â·0 mg; for â‰¥10% weight loss, the corresponding numbers were 72 (7%), 182 (37%; 7Â·6, 5Â·6 to 10Â·2; p < 0Â·0001), and 467 (48%; 11Â·7, 8Â·9 to 15Â·4; p < 0Â·0001). The most common adverse events were dry mouth (24 [2%], 67 [13%], and 207 [21%] in the groups assigned to placebo, phentermine 7Â·5 mg plus topiramate 46Â·0 mg, and phentermine 15Â·0 mg plus topiramate 92Â·0 mg, respectively), paraesthesia (20 [2%], 68 [14%], and 204 [21%], respectively), constipation (59 [6%], 75 [15%], and 173 [17%], respectively), insomnia (47 [5%], 29 [6%], and 102 [10%], respectively), dizziness (31 [3%], 36 [7%], 99 [10%], respectively), and dysgeusia (11 [1%], 37 [7%], and 103 [10%], respectively). 38 (4%) patients assigned to placebo, 19 (4%) to phentermine 7Â·5 mg plus topiramate 46Â·0 mg, and 73 (7%) to phentermine 15Â·0 mg plus topiramate 92Â·0 mg had depression-related adverse events; and 28 (3%), 24 (5%), and 77 (8%), respectively, had anxiety-related adverse events.

446,Tinnitus and underlying brain mechanisms,"Purpose Of Review: Tinnitus is the sensation of hearing a sound when no external auditory stimulus is present. Most individuals experience tinnitus for brief, unobtrusive periods. However, chronic sensation of tinnitus affects approximately 17% (44 million people) of the general US population. Tinnitus, usually a benign symptom, can be constant, loud and annoying to the point that it causes significant emotional distress, poor sleep, less efficient activities of daily living, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation/attempts. Tinnitus remains a major challenge to physicians because its pathophysiology is poorly understood and there are few management options to offer to patients. The purpose of this article is to describe the current understanding of central neural mechanisms in tinnitus and to summarize recent developments in clinical approaches to tinnitus patients.; Recent Findings: Recently developed animal models of tinnitus provide the possibility to determine neuronal mechanisms of tinnitus generation and to test the effects of various treatments. The latest research using animal models has identified a number of abnormal changes, in both auditory and nonauditory brain regions, that underlie tinnitus. Furthermore this research sheds light on cellular mechanisms that are responsible for development of these abnormal changes.; Summary: Tinnitus remains a challenging disorder for patients, physicians, audiologists and scientists studying tinnitus-related brain changes. This article reviews recent findings of brain changes in animal models associated with tinnitus and a brief review of clinical approach to tinnitus patients.;Psychoacoustics*, Auditory Pathways/*physiopathology, Brain/*physiopathology, Tinnitus/*physiopathology, Animals, Female, Forecasting, Humans, Male, Needs Assessment, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Tinnitus/etiology, Tinnitus/therapy","Galazyuk, Alexander V; Wenstrup, Jeffrey J & Hamid, Mohamed A",0,446
447,Facility-Level Characteristics Associated with Serious Suicide Attempts and Deaths from Suicide in Juvenile Justice Residential Facilities,"Little is known about how facility-level characteristics affect the risk of suicide and suicide attempts in juvenile justice residential facilities. This leaves facility administrators and mental health providers without evidence-based guidance on how the facility itself affects risks. The current study uses data from two recently developed censuses of juvenile justice facilities in the United States to examine the relationship between facility-level characteristics and the likelihood of a facility reporting serious suicide attempts and deaths from suicide. Results suggest highest risks for facilities housing larger populations of Black young people and for facilities locking sleeping room doors. Lower risks are found for facilities screening all young people within 24 hours of arrival.

448,Deaths in juvenile justice residential facilities,"Purpose: To provide the first national description of death in juvenile justice residential facilities. Methods: Data come from recent censuses of all public and private juvenile justice facilities in the United States. Death rates for the custody population are adjusted for length at risk, and are compared to death rates of adolescents in the general population. Multivariate modeling is used to identify facility-level risk factors related to deaths. Results: Adjusting for the number of days at risk, adolescents in juvenile justice facilities have lower risks of death by accident and homicide, but considerably higher risks of death from suicide and illness (200% and 50%, respectively). Facilities with larger Black populations, those that lock sleeping room doors, and facilities designed to screen young persons for future placements all had significantly higher odds of experiencing a death. Conclusions: The higher rates of death from suicide or illness suggest either (a) juvenile justice facilities host very high risk adolescents who would have died on the outside, (b) the facility environment itself increases the risk of death relative to the adolescents' environment outside the facility, particularly in the case of deaths from suicide, (c) placement in a juvenile justice facility may be indicative of a time of crisis in adolescents' lives in terms of physical or mental health and thus the risk of death increases, or most realistically, (d) some combination of the above. That deaths are more likely in facilities with larger Black populations warrants significant future investigation. Finally, the policy of locking sleeping room doors should be seriously evaluated in light of the strong association found with suicide.

449,A mixed methods epidemiological investigation of preventable deaths among US Army soldiers assigned to a rehabilitative warrior transition unit,"Background: The prevalence of medical risk factors for suicide (e.g., mental disorders, severe disability, social disruption) may be higher among WTs compared to traditional Army units. Likewise, the extent to which traditional factors that protect soldiers from developing serious mental disorders (e.g., social support, unit cohesion, leadership) are present among soldiers assigned to the WTU is unclear. Objectives: An epidemiological consultation (EPICON) was conducted in 2010 to assess potential causes for a perceived high rate of suicides and preventable deaths in U.S. Army Warrior Transition Units (WTUs) and to identify potential improvements to the system of care. Methods of Study: The EPICON focused on: (1) risk factors for suicide/preventable deaths; (2) chronic pain management; (3) utilization of and access to WTU medical and behavioral health (BH) services; and (4) the impact of the WTU environment on mission focus and warrior disposition. BH history was examined for soldiers who died by suicide or preventable death while assigned to the WTU (index cases) and a representative comparison group of non-index case soldiers. Surveys and focus groups were conducted at four WTUs with Warriors in Transition (WTs) and key support staff. Results: The use of psychotropic and/or CNS depressant medications, prevalence of BH diagnoses and substance use disorders, polypharmacy, alcohol use, and a high cumulative number of stressors were identified as important risk factors for preventable deaths in the WTC. Areas of potential improvement to the system of care included addressing negative perceptions of the WTU environment, lack of social support, barriers to accessing BH services and issues related to coordination of care. Conclusions: There was no one single risk factor found to be associated with an increased likelihood of preventable deaths within the WTU. The unique design and operation of the WTUs as environments focused on treatment and rehabilitation provide both benefits and challenges to recovery and risk mitigation.

450,Correlates of sexual initiation among European adolescents,"Background: Sexuality is a physiological component of adolescent development, though early initiation is associated with reproductive health risk. This study aimed at identifying correlates and predictors of sexual initiation in a large multinational cohort of European adolescents.; Methods: A questionnaire addressing socio-demographics, behaviours, mental health and sexual activity, was delivered to 11,110 adolescents recruited from 168 randomly selected schools in 10 European countries between 2009 and 2011. A follow-up questionnaire was delivered after 12 months. The longitudinal association of baseline risk behaviors, psychological attributes and contextual vulnerabilities, with sexual initiation during follow-up was evaluated through simple and multivariable age/sex stratified logistic regression. Multinomial logistic regression measured the association between predictors and sexual initiation with or without coexisting reproductive risk factors, such as multiple partners or infrequent condom use.; Results: Baseline sexual experience was reported by 19.2% of 10,757 respondents (median age 15; IQR 14-15; females 59.6%). This was significantly more frequent among pupils older than 15 (41%) and males (20.8%). Of 7,111 pupils without previous experience who were available at follow-up (response rate 81.8%), 17% reported sexual initiation, without differences between females and males. Baseline smoking (age/sex adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.63), alcohol use (aOR 2.95), illegal drugs use (aOR 2.72), and poor sleep (aOR 1.71) predicted sexual initiation. Stratified analyses showed a particularly strong association in case of younger and female pupils, and, among girls, when initiation was reported together with multiple partners and/or infrequent condom use. Externalizing (i.e. conduct and hyperactivity) symptoms independently predicted sexual initiation. Internalizing difficulties (i.e. emotional and peer problems) were negatively associated with early and risky sexual initiation among boys. Significant predictors included also being bullied, fighting, truancy, and low parental involvement.; Conclusions: Adolescent sexual behaviours are related to non-sexual risk behaviours, psychological difficulties and contextual vulnerabilities. While gateway effects explain some associations, a comprehensive model is needed to understand adolescent sexual behaviours, their physical, mental, and social health outcomes, and their potential positive effects on wellbeing. Tailored interventions may need to consider younger girls as a particularly vulnerable group in view of a strong association between non-sexual and sexual behaviors.; Adolescent Behavior*, Sexual Behavior*, Adolescent, Adult, Europe, Female, Humans, Male, Surveys and Questionnaires","Gambadauro, Pietro; Carli, Vladimir; Hadlaczky, GergÃ¶; Sarchiapone, Marco; Apter, Alan; Balazs, Judit; Banzer, Raphaela; Bobes, Julio; Brunner, Romuald; Cosman, Doina; Farkas, Luca; Haring, Christian; Hoven, Christina W.; Kaess, Michael; Kahn, Jean Pierre; McMahon, Elaine; Postuvan, Vita; Sisask, Merike; VÃ¤rnik, Airi; Zadravec Sedivy, Nusa & Wasserman, Danuta",1,450
451,Are hypomanics the happier normals?,"Background: Not much is known about hypomanic states in subjects free of major and minor depressive mood disorders. Our aim was to identify and characterise a group of such pure"" hypomanics in relation to a normal control group.; Methods: Data were obtained from the Swiss Zurich study a stratified epidemiological sample of young adults from the general population followed from age 20 to 40. ""Pure"" hypomania was defined as a period of increased activity and decreased need for sleep with consequences (e.g. legal trouble or reactions by others). Minor and major mood disorders were excluded.; Results: Twenty-three subjects were identified as pure hypomanics. They overlapped minimally with and were clearly different from subjects with DSM-IV defined hypomanic episodes most of whom had a bipolar disorder. Pure hypomanics were characterised by physical and social overactivity elevated and irritable mood as well as increases in extraversion sexual interest and risk-taking behaviors. They had higher monthly incomes and were more often married than controls. Subjective distress due to hypomanic symptoms was virtually absent. Quality of life and treatment rates for mood and anxiety were not different from controls although sleep disturbances substance abuse and binge eating were more frequent.; Limitations: The subsample identified was small. Due to the focus of the study on pathology some positive aspects of hypomania may have been missed.; Conclusions: The existence of a group of pure hypomanics presenting a mixed picture of clinically relevant and irrelevant characteristics supports the concept of a continuum from normal to pathological mood states.;""Accession Number: 18405979.

452,Earlier parental set bedtimes as a protective factor against depression and suicidal ideation,"Study Objectives: To examine the relationships between parental set bedtimes, sleep duration, and depression as a quasi-experiment to explore the potentially bidirectional relationship between short sleep duration and depression. Short sleep duration has been shown to precede depression, but this could be explained as a prodromal symptom of depression. Depression in an adolescent can affect his/her chosen bedtime, but it is less likely to affect a parent's chosen set bedtime which can establish a relatively stable upper limit that can directly affect sleep duration. Design: Multivariate cross-sectional analyses of the ADD Health using logistic regression. Setting: United States nationally representative, school-based, probability-based sample in 1994-96. Participants: Adolescents (n = 15,659) in grades 7 to 12. Measurements and Results: Adolescents with parental set bedtimes of midnight or later were 24% more likely to suffer from depression (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.49) and 20% more likely to have suicidal ideation (1.20,1.01-1.41) than adolescents with parental set bedtimes of 10:00 PM or earlier, after controlling for covariates. Consistent with sleep duration and perception of getting enough sleep acting as mediators, the inclusion of these variables in the multivariate models appreciably attenuated the associations for depression (1.07, 0.88-1.30) and suicidal ideation (1.09, 0.92-1.29). Conclusions: The results from this study provide new evidence to strengthen the argument that short sleep duration could play a role in the etiology of depression. Earlier parental set bedtimes could therefore be protective against adolescent depression and suicidal ideation by lengthening sleep duration.

453,Predictors and correlates of interest in assisted suicide in the final month of life among ALS patients in Oregon and Washington,"Studied factors associated with interest in assisted suicide among terminally ill patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 50 caregivers of decedent ALS patients from Oregon and Washington were surveyed regarding perceptions of patients' interest in assisted suicide and their physical and emotional state in the last month of life. For 38 caregivers, there was baseline information from the patients themselves, gathered a median of 11 mo before death, regarding depression, hopelessness, sense of burden, social support, quality of life, pain, and suffering. Results show that according to the respondents, one-third of ALS patients discussed wanting assisted suicide in the last month of life. Hopelessness and interest in assisted suicide at baseline predicted desire for assisted suicide later on. ALS patients who were interested in assisted suicide, compared to those who were not, had greater distress at being a burden to others and more insomnia, pain, and discomfort other than pain.

454,Deliberate self-harm among children with disabilities in China: a matched case-control study,"Background: Study about deliberate self-harm (DSH) in children with different types of disabilities was scarce. This study compared the incidence and patterns of DSH between children with and without disabilities aged 6-17 years using a matched case-control study in Beijing.; Methods: A total of 650 pairs of children with and without disabilities were surveyed. Characteristics of latest episode of self-harm within the 12 months were compared. Associations between disability status, sociodemographic factors, smoking, drinking, sleep problems, and self-harm were examined.; Results: Children with disabilities showed significant higher incidence of DSH than children without disabilities. Two groups differed significantly in terms of self-harm methods, body parts injured, premeditation, wishing to be known by others and help-seeking behavior. The adjusted OR for self-harm was 4.76 (2.99-7.55) for children with disabilities compared with children without disabilities. Children who slept fewer than 6â€‰h per night, had difficulty falling asleep at night sometimes/often, and went to sleep after midnight 1 to 3 nights per month or at least once a week were at elevated risk of self-harm.; Conclusion: This study highlights a strong relationship between disability, sleep problems, and DSH. Interventions to reduce self-harm should target disability and sleep problems as important risk factors.; ","Gao, Qi; Xiang, Henry; Xiang, Yu-Tao & Zhu, Huiping",0,454
455,Assessing suicide risk in stroke patients: review of two cases,"Poststroke depression can be accompanied by suicidal ideation, yet reports of suicide among stroke patients are rare. When untreated, depression can become prolonged and severe. Risk factors for suicide include depression, severe insomnia, chronic illness, and organic brain syndrome. Early clinical assessment of suicide risk factors is essential in the rehabilitation setting. Two patients who developed mood disturbances in the acute poststroke period and eventually committed suicide are presented. Neither patient openly expressed suicidal thoughts to staff or family members. Retrospective analysis of medical records was compared to established suicide risk factors reported in the medical literature. Indirect verbal cues and nonverbal behavior patterns indicating potential suicide risk may have been present. Strategies for evaluation and management of suicidal behavior are discussed. These cases emphasize the need for early assessment of suicide risk by the entire rehabilitation team.;Brain Ischemia/*psychology, Depression/*psychology, Suicide/*prevention & control, Aged, Depression/rehabilitation, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors","Garden, F H; Garrison, S J & Jain, A",0,455
456,Anticholinergic drug-induced delirium in an elderly Alzheimer's dementia patient,"Drug-induced delirium is a common matter in the elderly and anticholinergics, together with a number of different drugs, may significantly contribute to the delirium onset, especially in demented people. We report a case of a probable anticholinergic drug-induced delirium in an elderly patient. An 80-year-old man with Alzheimer's dementia presented with wandering, depressed mood with crying, somatic worries, anedonism and suicide recurrent ideas. A first external psychiatric assessment led to the diagnosis of melancholic depression and therapy with haloperidol 2 mg/day, orphenadrine 100 mg daily, amitriptyline 40 mg/day, lorazepam 2 mg/day was started. Two weeks later patient suddenly developed delirium, characterized by nocturnal agitation, severe insomnia, daytime sedation, confusion, hallucinations and persecutory delusions. These symptoms progressively worsened, with the consequent caregiver's stress. A geriatric consultation axcluded the main causes of delirium, therefore both Operative Units of Pharmacovigilance and Psychiatry were activated, for a clinical pharmacological and psychiatric assessment. Haloperidol, amitriptyline and orphenadrine were promptly dismissed. The patient began a treatment with quetiapine 25 mg/day for two days, then twice a day, and infusion of saline 1000 ml/day for two days; psychiatric symptoms gradually diminished and therapy with galantamine was begun. We postulate that this clinical report is suggestive for an anticholinergic drug- induced delirium since the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between delirium and drug therapy. In conclusion, a complete geriatric, pharmacological, and psychiatric evaluation might be necessary in order to reduce the adverse drug reactions in older patients treated with many drugs.

457,Intranasal abuse of prescribed methylphenidate,"A 15-yr-old male patient with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who had been receiving stimulants since the age of 11 yrs presented in crisis after a 2-wk period of intranasal abuse of methylphenidate. The S reported taking crushed tablets to produce a euphoric state. This mood elevation was accompanied by increased activity, insomnia, and anorexia lasting up to 6 hrs. The drug was taken 2 or 3 times in a 24-hr period until the S was exhausted and would sleep for 14-16 hrs. When confronted about the missing medication, the S was acutely distressed and expressed suicidal ideas. When evaluated clinically 3 days later, the S was very subdued, depressed in affect, tired, and ravenously hungry. Despite the fact that abuse of one's own prescribed stimulants is relatively uncommon, the vulnerability of adolescents with ADHD to experiment with substances and the greater availability of methylphenidate make is likely that increased abuse of this nature will occur.

458,Treating insomnia in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders: A focused review,"Despite its known negative effects on physical and mental health, insomnia is an often-ignored condition. Insomnia is both a risk factor for, and a symptom of, several psychiatric disorders and a predictor of death by suicide, making it an important target for intervention. It is the position of the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that the first-line treatment for sleep continuity disturbance should be Cognitiveâ€“Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I); however, medical, psychiatric, and psychological communities remain largely unaware of the existence and effectiveness of this therapy. The purposes of this article are to review the following: (a) literature on the relationship between insomnia and psychological health; (b) official guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of insomnia; (c) typical delivery of CBT-I; (d) evidence for the efficacy of CBT-I in insomnia that occurs cormbid with depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress diso)insomnia, CBT-I, sleep, psychiatric disorders, cognitiveâ€“behavioral therapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Comorbidity, Insomnia, Mental Disorders, Sleep","Garland, Sheila N.; Vargas, Ivan; Grandner, Michael A. & Perlis, Michael L.",0,458
459,Atomoxetine: a review of its use in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents,"Atomoxetine (Strattera(R)) is a selective norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor that is not classified as a stimulant, and is indicated for use in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine is effective and generally well tolerated. It is significantly more effective than placebo and standard current therapy and does not differ significantly from or is noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate; however, it is significantly less effective than the extended-release methylphenidate formulation OROS(R) methylphenidate (hereafter referred to as osmotically released methylphenidate) and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. Atomoxetine can be administered either as a single daily dose or split into two evenly divided doses, has a negligible risk of abuse or misuse, and is not a controlled substance in the US. Atomoxetine is particularly useful for patients at risk of substance abuse, as well as those who have co-morbid anxiety or tics, or who do not wish to take a controlled substance. Thus, atomoxetine is a useful option in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. The mechanism of action of atomoxetine is unclear, but is thought to be related to its selective inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. Atomoxetine has a high affinity and selectivity for norepinephrine transporters, but little or no affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors. Atomoxetine has a demonstrated ability to selectively inhibit norepinephrine uptake in humans and animals, and studies have shown that it preferentially binds to areas of known high distribution of noradrenergic neurons, such as the fronto-cortical subsystem. Atomoxetine was generally associated with statistically, but not clinically, significant increases in both heart rate and blood pressure in pediatric patients with ADHD. While there was an initial loss in expected height and weight among atomoxetine recipients, this eventually returned to normal in the longer term. Data suggest that atomoxetine is unlikely to have any abuse potential. Atomoxetine appeared less likely than methylphenidate to exacerbate disordered sleep in pediatric patients with ADHD. Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed, and demonstrates dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure. It undergoes extensive biotransformation, which is affected by poor metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in a small percentage of the population; these patients have greater exposure to and slower elimination of atomoxetine than extensive metabolizers. Patients with hepatic insufficiency show an increase in atomoxetine exposure. CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, are associated with changes in atomoxetine pharmacokinetics similar to those observed among poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Once- or twice-daily atomoxetine was effective in the short-term treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents, as observed in several well designed placebo-controlled trials. Atomoxetine also demonstrated efficacy in the longer term treatment of these patients. A single morning dose was shown to be effective into the evening, and discontinuation of atomoxetine was not associated with symptom rebound. Atomoxetine efficacy did not appear to differ between children and adolescents. Stimulant-naive patients also responded well to atomoxetine treatment. Atomoxetine did not differ significantly from or was noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD with regard to efficacy, and was significantly more effective than standard current therapy (any combination of medicines [excluding atomoxetine] and/or behavioral counseling, or no treatment). However, atomoxetine was significantly less effective than osmotically released methylphenidate and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. The efficacy of atomoxetine did not appear to be affected by the presence of co-morbid disorders, and symptoms of the co-morbid disorders were not affected or were improved by atomoxetine administration. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) appeared to be positively affected by atomoxetine in both short- and long-term studies; atomoxetine also improved HR-QOL to a greater extent than standard current therapy. Atomoxetine was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with ADHD. Common adverse events included headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, somnolence, and nausea. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate; there was a very low incidence of serious adverse events. Few patients discontinued atomoxetine treatment because of adverse events. Atomoxetine discontinuation appeared to be well tolerated, with a low incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse events. Atomoxetine appeared better tolerated among extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers than among poor metabolizers. Slight differences were evident in the adverse event profiles of atomoxetine and stimulants, both immediate- and extended-release. Somnolence appeared more common among atomoxetine recipients and insomnia appeared more common among stimulant recipients. A black-box warning for suicidal ideation has been published in the US prescribing information, based on findings from a meta-analysis showing that atomoxetine is associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal ideation than placebo. Rarely, atomoxetine may also be associated with serious liver injury; postmarketing data show that three patients have had liver-related adverse events deemed probably related to atomoxetine treatment. Treatment algorithms involving the initial use of atomoxetine appear cost effective versus algorithms involving initial methylphenidate (immediate- or extended-release), dexamfetamine, tricyclic antidepressants, or no treatment in stimulant-naive, -failed, and -contraindicated children and adolescents with ADHD. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year is below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, as shown in several Markov model analyses conducted from the perspective of various European countries, with a time horizon of 1 year.;Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy, Propylamines/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects, Atomoxetine Hydrochloride, Child, Drug Administration Schedule, Humans, Propylamines/administration & dosage, Propylamines/adverse effects","Garnock-Jones, Karly P & Keating, Gillian M",0,459
460,How should primary care doctors select which antidepressants to administer?,"Clinicians can choose among various second-generation antidepressants for treating depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, subsyndromal depression, or dysthymia. Systematic reviews indicate that available drugs differ in frequency of administration, costs, and the risks of some adverse events but have similar efficacy for treating major depressive disorder. Furthermore, evidence does not support the choice of one antidepressant over another based on accompanying symptoms, such anxiety, insomnia, or pain. Available studies provide little guidance for clinicians about the benefits of second-generation antidepressants for treating dysthymia and subsyndromal depression. Evidence is also unclear about the comparative risks of serious adverse events, such as suicidality, seizures, fractures, increased bleeding, or serotonin syndrome.

461,Suicidality among adolescent Alberta Indians,"A high rate of suicide attempts and suicide ideation characterized a sample of 229 grade 7 to 9 adolescents resident on seven reserves in central Alberta. The prevalence of suicidality for these adolescent Indians was very similar to rates reported for Navajo youth and for 8th- and 10th-grade American non-Indian students. Comparison of Indian and non-Indian suicidality risk factors showed somewhat elevated levels of family disruption and psychological problems among Indian adolescents. Compared to Canadian nonadolescents, substance abuse levels were high, and conditions necessary to modeling were virtually omnipresent. Suicide ideation was significantly elevated for Indian adolescents with low psychological well-being, no father in the home, and a prior suicide in the household. Controlling for age, risk factors for suicide attempts were heavy alcohol use, no father in the home, sleeping problems, and low psychological well-being. The high rates of adolescent Native suicide imply that a much higher proportion of their suicide attempts succeed. Targeted, community-based counselling and educational programs are needed to address these problems.; Personality Development*, Social Environment*, Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Alberta/epidemiology, Cause of Death, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Incidence, Male, Risk Factors, Suicide/prevention & control, Suicide/psychology, Suicide, Attempted/prevention & control, Suicide, Attempted/psychology","Gartrell, J.

There were 133 (83.1%) statements based on strong (best evidence level [BEL] 1 = 79 [49.4%]) or intermediate (BEL 2 = 54 [33.7%]) levels of scientific substantiation. There were 34 (23.6%) evidence-based recommendation grades (Grades A-C = 144) that were adjusted based on subjective factors. Among the 1,790 reference citations used in this CPG, 524 (29.3%) were based on strong (evidence level [EL] 1), 605 (33.8%) were based on intermediate (EL 2), and 308 (17.2%) were based on weak (EL 3) scientific studies, with 353 (19.7%) based on reviews and opinions (EL 4).; Conclusion: The final recommendations recognize that obesity is a complex, adiposity-based chronic disease, where management targets both weight-related complications and adiposity to improve overall health and quality of life. The detailed evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision-making that addresses real-world medical care of patients with obesity, including screening, diagnosis, evaluation, selection of therapy, treatment goals, and individualization of care. The goal is to facilitate high-quality care of patients with obesity and provide a rational, scientific approach to management that optimizes health outcomes and safety.; Abbreviations: A1C = hemoglobin A1c AACE = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ACE = American College of Endocrinology ACSM = American College of Sports Medicine ADA = American Diabetes Association ADAPT = Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promotion Trial ADHD = attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder AHA = American Heart Association AHEAD = Action for Health in Diabetes AHI = apnea-hypopnea index ALT = alanine aminotransferase AMA = American Medical Association ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker ART = assisted reproductive technology AUC = area under the curve BDI = Beck Depression Inventory BED = binge eating disorder BEL = best evidence level BLOOM = Behavioral Modification and Lorcaserin for Overweight and Obesity Management BLOSSOM = Behavioral Modification and Lorcaserin Second Study for Obesity Management BMI = body mass index BP = blood pressure C-SSRS = Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale CAD = coronary artery disease CARDIA = Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults CBT = cognitive behavioral therapy CCO = Consensus Conference on Obesity CHF = congestive heart failure CHO = carbohydrate CI = confidence interval COR-I = Contrave Obesity Research I CPG = clinical practice guideline CV = cardiovascular CVD = cardiovascular disease DASH = Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DBP = diastolic blood pressure DEXA = dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry DPP = Diabetes Prevention Program DSE = diabetes support and education EL = evidence level ED = erectile dysfunction ER = extended release EWL = excess weight loss FDA = Food and Drug Administration FDG = 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid GERD = gastroesophageal reflux disease GI = gastrointestinal GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide 1 HADS = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HDL-c = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol HR = hazard ratio HTN = hypertension HUNT = Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study ICSI = intracytoplasmic sperm injection IFG = impaired fasting glucose IGT = impaired glucose tolerance ILI = intensive lifestyle intervention IVF = in vitro fertilization LAGB = laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding LDL-c = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LES = lower esophageal sphincter LSG = laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy LV = left ventricle LVH = left ventricular hypertrophy LVBG = laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events MAOI = monoamine oxidase inhibitor MI = myocardial infarction MNRCT = meta-analysis of non-randomized prospective or case-controlled trials MRI = magnetic resonance imaging MUFA = monounsaturated fatty acid FLD = nonalcoholic fatty liver disease SH = nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NES = night eating syndrome NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys NHLBI = National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute NHS = Nurses' Health Study NICE = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence OA = osteoarthritis OGTT = oral glucose tolerance test OR = odds ratio OSA = obstructive sleep apnea PHQ-9 = Patient Health Questionnaire PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome PCP = primary care physician POMC = pro-opiomelanocortin POWER = Practice-Based Opportunities for Weight Reduction PPI = proton pump inhibitor PRIDE = Program to Reduce Incontinence by Diet and Exercise PSA = prostate specific antigen QOL = quality of life RA = receptor agonist RCT = randomized controlled trial ROC = receiver operator characteristic RR = relative risk RYGB = Roux-en-Y gastric bypass SAD = sagittal abdominal diameter SBP = systolic blood pressure SCOUT = Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcome Trial SG = sleeve gastrectomy SHBG = sex hormonebinding globulin SIEDY = Structured Interview on Erectile Dysfunction SNRI = serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SOS = Swedish Obese Subjects SS = surveillance study SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors STORM = Sibutramine Trial on Obesity Reduction and Maintenance TCA = tricyclic antidepressant TONE = Trial of Nonpharmacologic Intervention in the Elderly TOS = The Obesity Society T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus UKPDS = United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study U.S = United States VAT = visceral adipose tissue VLDL = very low-density lipoprotein WC = waist circumference WHO = World Health Organization WHR = waist-hip ratio WHtR = waist-to-height ratio WMD = weighted mean difference WOMAC = Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index XENDOS = XEnical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects.; Obesity/*therapy, Clinical Decision-Making, Humans, Obesity/epidemiology, Obesity/etiology, Quality of Life, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/standards, Treatment Outcome, United States","Garvey, W.

Patients admitted to pediatric units tended to be younger and were more often described as manifesting depression and sleep disturbances. However, no differences were found between the groups for other factors investigated (i.e., sex, socio-professional category of parents, academic level, family situation, psychiatric problems, social problems). Findings showed that, for a similar psychosocial profile, pediatric units contacted the family doctors more often and proposed a more extensive follow-up than other departments.

464,Depressive symptom profiles and severity patterns in outpatients with psychotic vs nonpsychotic major depression,"Background: Previous research suggests that patients with psychotic major depression (PMD) may differ from those with nonpsychotic major depression (NMD) not only in psychotic features but also in their depressive symptom presentation. The present study contrasted the rates and severity of depressive symptoms in outpatients diagnosed with PMD vs NMD. Method: The sample consisted of 1112 patients diagnosed with major depression, of which 60 (5.3%) exhibited psychotic features. Depressive symptoms were assessed by trained diagnosticians at intake using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition and supplemented by severity items from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Results: Patients with PMD were more likely to endorse the presence of weight loss, insomnia, psychomotor agitation, indecisiveness, and suicidality compared with NMD patients. Furthermore, PMD patients showed higher levels of severity on several depressive symptoms, including depressed mood, appetite loss, insomnia, psychomotor disturbances (agitation and retardation), fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, cognitive disturbances (concentration and indecisiveness), hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. The presence of psychomotor disturbance, insomnia, indecisiveness, and suicidal ideation was predictive of diagnostic status even after controlling for the effects of demographic characteristics and other symptoms. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with past research suggesting that PMD is characterized by a unique depressive symptom profile in addition to psychotic features and higher levels of overall depression severity. The identification of specific depressive symptoms in addition to delusions/hallucinations that can differentiate PMD vs NMD patients can aid in the early detection of the disorder. These investigations also provide insights into potential treatment targets for this high-risk population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

466,"Poor sleep quality, antepartum depression and suicidal ideation among pregnant women","Objective: To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation during the third trimester. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders. Results: Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. â‰¤ 5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.81; 95% CI 1.78â€“4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.15â€“1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR = 13.56 95% CI 7.53â€“24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor. Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women.

467,Association of poor subjective sleep quality with suicidal ideation among pregnant Peruvian women,"Objective: To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results: Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P < .001). After adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs. â‰¤5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.02-2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.08-1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR = 3.48; 95% CI 1.96-6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion: Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

468,Circadian biomarkers in patients with bipolar disorder: promising putative predictors of lithium response,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common, severe mental disorder with a high recurrence rate. Lithium (Li) is the cornerstone of BD treatments to reduce recurrence, suicide, and mortality risks. However, only 30% of patients treated with Li achieve complete remission, and few markers of the response to treatment have yet been identified for application in routine practice. Circadian biomarkers may be relevant predictors of individual responses to Li because (1) Li has been shown to affect circadian rhythms, (2) disrupted circadian rhythms are a core expression of susceptibility to BD, and (3) circadian abnormalities during euthymia are associated with relapses.; ","Geoffroy, Pierre Alexis; Etain, Bruno; Sportiche, Sarah & Bellivier, Frank",1,468
469,Seven Fears and the Science of How Mobile Technologies May Be Influencing Adolescents in the Digital Age,"Close to 90% of U.S. adolescents now own or have access to a mobile phone, and they are using them frequently. Adolescents send and receive an average of over 60 text messages per day from their devices, and over 90% of adolescents now access the Internet from a mobile device at least occasionally. Many adults are asking how this constant connectivity is influencing adolescents' development. In this article, we examine seven commonly voiced fears about the influence of mobile technologies on adolescents' safety (e.g., cyberbullying and online solicitation), social development (e.g., peer relationships, parent-child relationships, and identity development), cognitive performance, and sleep. Three sets of findings emerge. First, with some notable exceptions (e.g., sleep disruption and new tools for bullying), most online behaviors and threats to well-being are mirrored in the offline world, such that offline factors predict negative online experiences and effects. Second, the effects of mobile technologies are not uniform, in that benefits appear to be conferred for some adolescents (e.g., skill building among shy adolescents), whereas risk is exacerbated among others (e.g., worsening existing mental health problems). Third, experimental and quasi-experimental studies that go beyond a reliance on self-reported information are required to understand how, for whom, and under what conditions adolescents' interactions with mobile technologies influence their still developing social relationships, brains, and bodies.; Â© The Author(s) 2015.Adolescent Development*, Adolescent Health*, Cell Phone*, Internet*, Psychology, Adolescent*, Adolescent Behavior/*psychology, Adolescent, Bullying, Cognition, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Mental Health, Sleep, adolescent development, cognitive performance, cyberbullying, mobile technologies, multitasking, online safety, parental monitoring, peer relationships, sleep","George, Madeleine J. & Odgers, Candice L.",1,469
470,Prescription Benzodiazepine Use Among Older Adults: A Critical Review,"Objectives: Despite evidence for many potential risks, use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) among older adults is common. The authors evaluated the available evidence for BZD effectiveness and tolerability for use in older adults in three psychiatric conditions for which BZDs are commonly prescribed: insomnia, anxiety disorders, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.; Design: Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, were searched to identify articles that (1) included patients â‰¥50 years of age, (2) focused on patients diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety disorders, or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and (3) were either a randomized, placebo-controlled trial or a randomized trial comparing a BZD with either another psychotropic medication or psychotherapy.; Results: Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the three clinical indications evaluated, treatment of insomnia had the greatest available evidence for use of BZDs among older adults, with 21 of 25 trials demonstrating improved sleep outcomes with use of BZDs. Only one trial was found to meet eligibility criteria for BZD use in anxiety disorders, demonstrating benefit over placebo. Five studies for use in behavioral disturbances in dementia were included, of which only one demonstrated improvement over placebo.; Conclusion: This systematic review suggests that BZD prescribing to older adults is significantly in excess of what the available evidence suggests is appropriate. Future trials should focus on efforts to reduce both acute and chronic BZD use among older adults while improving access to effective non-pharmacologic treatment alternatives.; ","Gerlach, Lauren B.; Wiechers, Ilse R. & Maust, Donovan T.",0,470

In this issue of SLEEP, Trockel and colleagues13 explored this question and leveraged data collected from veterans with insomnia who were treated by clinicians enrolled in the VHA dissemination trial for the cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I). This dissemination trial aimed to increase the number of mental health providers trained to deliver evidence- based cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia in VHA clinics. The author highlighted the need for rigorous prospective clinical trials to directly evaluate the impact of insomnia treatments as a strategy for suicide prevention both in civilians and military populations.

Age-related circumstances (e.g., increased incidence of illness, bereavement, financial difficulties, institutionalization) may contribute to an increased rate of depression in the elderly. Symptoms (insomnia, obsessional thought, and hypochondriasis) may be increased in the elderly patient. The mainstay of pharmacotherapy has been the reuptake antidepressant agents. Trazodone has demonstrated comparable efficacy to the other reuptake and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors but has the advantages of a low cardiovascular-risk profile, extremely low suicide toxicity, absence of anticholinergic side effects, and minimal effects on cognition.

473,A holistic approach to factors affecting depression in haemodialysis patients,"Depression in dialysis populations is affected by co-morbid diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and immune dysfunction, and it also includes high suicide risk and frequent hospitalizations. Depressive disorders have a close association with malnutrition and chronic inflammation, as well as with cognitive impairment. Impaired cognitive function may be manifested as low adherence to dialysis treatment, leading to malnutrition. Additionally, chronic pain and low quality of sleep lead to high rates of depressive symptoms in haemodialysis patients, while an untreated depression can cause sleep disturbances and increased mortality risk. Depression can also lead to sexual dysfunction and non-adherence, while unemployment can cause depressive disorders, due to patients' feelings of being a financial burden on their family.

474,Grief and Avoidant Death Attitudes Combine to Predict the Fading Affect Bias,"The fading affect bias (FAB) occurs when unpleasant affect fades faster than pleasant affect. To detect mechanisms that influence the FAB in the context of death, we measured neuroticism, depression, anxiety, negative religious coping, death attitudes, and complicated grief as potential predictors of FAB for unpleasant/death and pleasant events at 2 points in time. The FAB was robust across older and newer events, which supported the mobilization-minimization hypothesis. Unexpectedly, complicated grief positively predicted FAB, and death avoidant attitudes moderated this relation, such that the Initial Event Affect by Grief interaction was only significant at the highest 3 quintiles of death avoidant attitudes. These results were likely due to moderate grief ratings, which were, along with avoidant death attitudes, related to healthy outcomes in past research. These results implicate complicated grief and death avoidant attitudes as resiliency mechanisms that are mobilized during bereavement to minimize its unpleasant effects",Gibbons JA; Lee SA; Fehr AMA; Wilson KJ; Marshall TR,1,474
475,Zolpidem-associated parasomnia with serious self-injury: A shot in the dark,"Presents a case report of a 49-year-old man with no prior psychiatric history was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. After extubation on the 15th hospital day, Psychiatry was consulted in the setting of an apparent suicide attempt. History was thus initially obtained from his family. Mr. D's family denied observing any signs of depression or other indication that he had been considering self-harm. Mr. D's family reported feeling quite confused about the circumstances of his admission, noting his extensive military career, firearms expertise, and collection of high caliber handguns all located in his bedroom and capable of inflicting greater damage than the .22 handgun kept on his nightstand. Mr. D's mental status improved gradually over the remaining course of his hospitalization. In the context of his prior recent sleep behaviors since starting Zolpidem and the absence of any indication of deliberate suicidality, it was theorized that his gunshot wound could be due to a parasomnia. Parasomnias have been defined as the group of primary sleep disorders that feature abnormal behaviors or physiologic phenomena occurring during sleep or the transition from wakefulness to sleep.

476,Further observations on the speed of death in hanging,"Given that most fatal hangings are suicidal and occur in locations that have been selected to conceal this activity (thus maximizing the chances of a lethal outcome), there has been very little corroboration of the speed with which unconsciousness and death may occur. A 35-year-old male is reported who committed suicide by hanging immediately after talking to his spouse. Police investigations confirmed her reliability as a witness indicating that lethal anoxia in this case had occurred within a very short time (most likely in less than 1 min) of suspension. The speed with which death may result from hanging not only gives an insight into fatal pathophysiological mechanisms, but also provides useful information for situations where a lethal outcome is to be avoided, or is not intended. For example, individuals at risk of suicide who are being monitored in institutional facilities need to be constantly under direct visual surveillance as significant hypoxia can be rapidly induced, parents and caregivers with infants and children in potentially unsafe sleeping environments need to realize how swiftly death or irreversible anoxic brain damage may occur from neck compression, and those who engage in recreational asphyxia should be informed just how quickly a fatal outcome may ensue.; Suicide*, Asphyxia/*pathology, Neck Injuries/*pathology, Adult, Contusions/pathology, Forensic Pathology, Humans, Male, Neck Muscles/injuries, Neck Muscles/pathology, Time Factors","Gilbert, John D.; Jensen, Lisbeth & Byard, Roger W.",0,476
477,Bupropion effective for interferon-induced depression,"Interferon (IFN)-a, a highly purified protein product manufactured by recombinant D technology, is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and several types of cancer. Common adverse effects of this drug include flu-like manifestations and psychiatric symptoms. In particular, depression and suicidality, psychosis, and mania have been reported. Case reports have indicated the efficacy of several types of antidepressants for IFN-a-induced depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), nortriptyline, imipramine, trazodone, and bupropion. Now comes the second published report on the effectiveness of bupropion for the treatment of IFN-a-induced depression. A 43-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C was started on pegylated IFN self-injected weekly and ribavirin 1,000 mg/day. Three months after she developed a major depressive episode characterized by sadness, crying spells, anhedonia, impaired concentration, and severe insomnia. She was started on sustained-release bupropion. At the first follow-up visit 20 days later, the patient reported significant improvement in her depressive symptoms and no side effects from the bupropion. The temporal sequence of events presented in this case is consistent with IFN-a-induced depression and with resolution attributable to bupropion.

A 28-year-old woman had a 2-year history of major depressive disorder with symptoms of depressed mood, insomnia, psychomotor retardation, and suicidal ideation. She denied a history of enuresis. Paroxetine was started at 10 mg/day, then gradually titrated to a dose of 40 mg/day over a 3-month period. Two weeks after initiation of paroxetine 40 mg/day, the patient began to experience nocturnal enuresis, occurring an average of four times per week. Paroxetine was reduced to 20 mg/day over the next 2 months, with gradual resolution of nocturnal enuresis over the following 4 weeks. There appears to have been a dosage-related association between paroxetine and nocturnal enuresis. Clinicians who prescribe paroxetine and other SSRIs ought to be aware of the potential development of enuresis and/or incontinence and need to query patients, particularly those at highest risk, with direct questions about this potential adverse effect.

Prior research has focused primarily on sociodemographic and psychiatric risk factors with little improvement in the prediction or prevention of suicidal behavior over time. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) may be an especially useful framework for advancing research in this area. This paper provides a brief and broad overview of research on suicidal behavior relating to each of the RDoC domains-highlighting the RDoC construct(s) where research has focused, construct(s) where research is lacking, and suggestions for future research directions. We also discuss major challenges for suicide research within the RDoC framework, including the intersection of RDoC domains, interaction of domains with the environment, incorporation of developmental stage, integration of distal and proximal processes, and inclusion of suicide-specific constructs. We conclude by underscoring important considerations for future research aimed at using the RDoC framework to study suicidal behavior and other forms of psychopathology.; Research Domain Criteria, risk factors, suicide, suicide attempt, suicide prevention","Glenn, Catherine R.; Cha, Christine B.; Kleiman, Evan M. & Nock, Matthew K.",0,479

Assessment was by the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD). The authors identified subgroup differences in SAD based on categories specified for nonseasonal depression. Patients with Bipolar Disorder (I and II) were more depressed (had higher SIGH-SAD scores) and showed more psychomotor agitation and social withdrawal than those with MDD. Bipolar I Ss had more psychomotor retardation, late insomnia, and social withdrawal than bipolar II Ss. Men showed more obsessions/compulsions and suicidality than women, while women showed more weight gain and early insomnia. Whites showed more guilt and fatigability than blacks, while blacks showed more hypochondriasis and social withdrawal. Darker-eyed Ss were significantly more depressed and fatigued than blue-eyed patients. Single and divorced or separated patients showed more hypochondriasis and diurnal variation than married patients. Employed Ss showed more atypical symptoms than unemployed patients, although most of the subgroup distinctions lay on the Hamilton Scale.

Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent correlates of SI. Measures included: ED psychopathology, ED behaviors (i.e., binge eating, vomiting, laxatives, compulsive exercise), current co-morbid psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety, insomnia), weight/shape concerns, ED-related clinical impairment, and body mass index (BMI). All significant variables were included in a backward binary multivariate logistic regression model to determine which variables were most strongly associated with SI.; Results: A total of 25.6% of the sample reported SI. All variables examined were significantly independently associated with SI, with the exception of compulsive exercise. Depression, anxiety, and vomiting remained as significant correlates of SI in the multivariate logistic regression model.; Discussion: ED screening on college campuses should assess for suicidality, and prevention and treatment efforts should target vomiting and co-morbid depression and anxiety symptoms to reduce risk of SI for high-risk individuals.; Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.eating disorders*, prevention*, suicidal ideation*, treatment*","Goel, Neha J.; Sadeh-Sharvit, Shiri; Flatt, Rachael E.; Trockel, Mickey; Balantekin, Katherine N.; Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E.; Monterubio, Grace E.; Firebaugh, Marie-Laure; Jacobi, Corinna; Wilfley, Denise E. & Taylor, C.

Polysomnographic data were obtained during the original study period when the Ss were adolescence (time 1). With clinical follow-up (time 2) assessments in hand, the objective was to ascertain whether there was any premorbid polysomnographic signs associated with depression during adolescence. Suicidality and recurrence of depression were also examined. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to analyze group differences in sleep measures and logistic regression for predicting 3 outcomes: lifetime depression, lifetime suicidality, and recurrence. Comparison of the depression-free normal Ss, the latent depressives, and the original major depressives revealed significant differences for sleep latency and sleep period time. Comparing all lifetime depressives to depression-free normal Ss revealed significantly more stages 3 and 4 (ST34) combined sleep and greater sleep period times among the depressives. Using logistic regression, the authors found that a longer sleep latency and sleep period time significantly predicted lifetime depression. Gender, ST34 sleep, and an interaction term for ST34 sleep and REM latency significantly predicted lifetime suicidality.

The objective was to assess the incidence and predictive factors of anxiety and depression symptoms during and after the therapy. Each patient received psychiatric assessment before, during and after treatment, with evaluations using Hamilton-anxiety and MADRS scales. Results confirm the great incidence of depression and anxiety not only during interferon alpha therapy but also after treatment is discontinued. Sleep disorders and MADRS ratings of M4 seem to be predictive of the therapy's side effects. Thus, there seem to be easily discernable parameters allowing depression and suicidal behaviour to be anticipated.

However, this relation has yet to be examined among older adults, despite older adults being at higher risk of suicidal behavior. Further, the current study aims to replicate previous research among younger adults showing that insomnia symptoms and nightmares are associated with suicide risk independent of the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide (IPTS).; Methods: The present study utilized 167 participants age 55 and older obtained by combining two independent mTurk data collections of adults in the United States.; Results: In the current sample, duration of nightmares was associated with suicide risk in older adults independent of symptoms of current insomnia and nightmares, duration of insomnia, and symptoms of PTSD, anhedonia, and the IPTS.; Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the duration of nightmares (i.e., how long someone has been experiencing nightmares) predict substantial variance in suicide risk among older adults in addition to the risk factors typically examined.

485,Depression and suicide among physician trainees: Recommendations for a national response,"According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 300 to 400 physicians commit suicide each year, approximately 1 physician per day. Medical training involves numerous risk factors for mental illness, such as role transition, decreased sleep, relocation resulting in fewer available support systems, and feelings of isolation. The literature on physician and trainee mental health characterizes the scope of the problem and provides guidance about opportunities for highly effective solutions. Trainee depression and suicide are well-known concerns in the medical community that have not yet been adequately addressed. Further data collection and research are needed to elucidate the specific elements of medical training that may contribute to the development of mental illness and the increased risk of physician suicide. Identification of evidence-based interventions that are successful in reducing the incidence of depression among physicians is also critically important. First steps would be to educate the academic community about these issues, encourage mental health screening, and foster help-seeking behavior and access to care for trainees.

Data were obtained from a demographic and clinical history interview conducted with 3595 homeless veterans. Odds-ratio (OR) statistics were used to assess potential for suicidal behavior. Statistically significant ratios were similar for ideation and attempts. The highest ratios were for self-report of depression and difficulty controlling violence, but statistically significant ratios were found for reporting sleeping in a treatment facility the night before the interview, receiving VA support for a psychiatric condition, and the diagnoses of Alcoholism, Mood Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Low but statistically significant odds-ratios were obtained for most of the physical health items. A negative odds-ratio was obtained for Africanâ€“American ethnicity. Logistic regression results indicated that for ideation and attempts items entered first involved subjective report of trouble controlling violent behavior and experiencing depression. High odds ratios for the interview items concerning experiencing serious depression and having difficulties controlling violence may have strong implications for treatment and management of homeless veterans. There may be up to 14â€“1 odds that an individual who reports being seriously depressed or having difficulty inhibiting aggression may have a serious potential for suicidal behaviors.

487,Sleep disturbance preceding completed suicide in adolescents,"We examined sleep difficulties preceding death in a sample of adolescent suicide completers as compared with a matched sample of community control adolescents. Sleep disturbances were assessed in 140 adolescent suicide victims with a psychological autopsy protocol and in 131 controls with a similar semistructured psychiatric interview. Rates of sleep disturbances were compared between groups. Findings indicate suicide completers had higher rates of overall sleep disturbance, insomnia, and hypersomnia as compared with controls within both the last week and the current affective episode. Group differences in overall sleep disturbance (both within the last week and present episode), insomnia (last week), and hypersomnia (last week) remained significant after controlling for the differential rate of affective disorder between groups. Similarly, overall sleep disturbance (last week and present episode) and insomnia (last week) distinguished completers in analyses accounting for severity of depressive symptoms. Only a small percentage of the sample exhibited changes in sleep symptom severity in the week preceding completed suicide, but of these, a higher proportion were completers. These findings support a significant and temporal relationship between sleep problems and completed suicide in adolescents. Sleep difficulties should therefore be carefully considered in prevention and intervention efforts for adolescents at risk for suicide. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

488,A new stress sensor and risk factor for suicide: the T allele of the functional genetic variant in the GABRA6 gene,"Low GABA transmission has been reported in suicide, and GABRA6 rs3219151 T allele has been associated with greater physiological and endocrine stress response in previous studies. Although environmental stress also plays a role in suicide, the possible role of this allele has not been investigated in this respect. In our present study effect of rs3219151 of GABRA6 gene in interaction with recent negative life events on lifetime and current depression, current anxiety, as well as lifetime suicide were investigated using regression models in a white European general sample of 2283 subjects. Post hoc measures for phenotypes related to suicide risk were also tested for association with rs3219151 in interaction with environmental stress. No main effect of the GABRA6 rs3219151 was detected, but in those exposed to recent negative life events GABRA6 T allele increased current anxiety and depression as well as specific elements of suicide risk including suicidal and death-related thoughts, hopelessness, restlessness and agitation, insomnia and impulsiveness as measured by the STOP task. Our data indicate that stress-associated suicide risk is elevated in carriers of the GABRA6 rs3219151 T allele with several independent markers and predictors of suicidal behaviours converging to this increased risk.; ","Gonda, Xenia; Sarginson, Jane; Eszlari, Nora; Petschner, Peter; Toth, Zoltan G.; Baksa, Daniel; Hullam, Gabor; Anderson, Ian M.; Deakin, J.

489,Preventing inpatient suicide,"Comments on an article by J. Fawcett et al (see record [rid]1987-13220-001[/rid]) regarding clinical predictors of suicide. The current author notes that Fawcett et al have gone a long way toward narrowing the 1-yr window as a prediction criterion by providing near-term predictors that should prove to be both practical and effective. Specifically, properly applied, they should save lives. Goodwin expects the findings of this article to change clinical practice, especially given the fact that suicide is the number one reason that psychiatrists are sued. Goodwin argues that Fawcett et al have come up with clear warning signs for the inpatient management of at-risk patients--not only what predicts their risk, but what misleads. The study suggests that the aggressive pharmacologic management of anxiety, panic, and insomnia should work and moves the field of psychiatry to a new level in what should be expected of suicide risk assessment. It will have wide impact, not only among clinicians, but also among lawyers.

490,Anticonvulsant therapy and suicide risk in affective disorders,"Patients with major affective disorders are more likely to complete suicide than patients in any other medical group. Established risk factors for completed suicide in affective disorders include acute depression (with turmoil, hopelessness, global insomnia, anhedonia, anxiety and/or panic), mixed episodes, rapid cycling, substance abuse, aggression and/or impulsivity, low serotonergic activity, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. Although anticonvulsants have mood-stabilizing and antidepressant properties, few data are available on the antisuicide effects of anticonvulsant treatment in manic-depressive patients. However, massive data have been accumulated on the antisuicide effect of lithium. This article discusses lithium vs anticonvulsants in the prevention of suicide associated with affective disorders and future treatment strategies to reduce this most serious complication of manic-depressive illness.

491,Response,"Reply by the current authors to the comment by Thompson et al (see record [rid]2004-14590-025[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2003-07002-004[/rid]). Thompson et al. identify a valid limitation regarding our article-namely, that the single Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) item screening for suicidal ideation (SI) is in fact a compound question asking about not only active thoughts of self-harm but also passive thoughts about whether life is worth living. A principal aim of the PHQ developers was to create a diagnostic measure that was both valid and brief to enhance its utility in clinical practice. This required collapsing related depression symptoms into the same item; this was true not only for the SI item but also for individual items about increased or decreased sleep, increased or decreased appetite or weight, and psychomotor agitation or retardation. A positive response to such compound items requires further probing by the clinician. Regarding the SI item, an initial follow-up question should clarify whether the patient is experiencing passive thoughts about death vs. active thoughts about self-harm. If the latter, further questioning about suicidal plans, past attempts, and suicidal risk factors is warranted.

492,Association between short sleep and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adults in the general population,"Objective: To determine the association between sleep, mental disorders, and suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) among adults in the community. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: National Comorbidity Survey (n = 8098). Participants: A representative sample of adults in the United States. Measurements and Results: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between usual number of hours of sleep during a 24-h period and SI and SA (past 12 months and lifetime). Analyses were adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics and comorbid mental disorders. Additional analyses examined the relationship between hours of sleep and the odds of SA among adults with SI, compared with SI without SA. Short sleep was associated with significantly increased odds of SI (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-3.9) and SA (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.4-6.4), and with SA among those with SI (past 12 months). These associations persisted after adjusting for differences in demographic characteristics and mental disorders, though the links between short sleep and SA among those with SI were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for panic, mood, and substance use disorders. Conclusions: Short sleep appears to be associated with increased likelihood of SI and SA, independent of the effects of comorbid mental disorders, among adults in the community. Among adults with SI, short sleep is associated with increased odds of SA, and this association seems largely related to the presence of panic attacks, mood, and substance use disorders. Future studies should investigate the nature of these relationships, and whether and how mental health problems may play a role. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

493,Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors--a review of the side effects in adolescents,"Background: Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for adolescents. GPs' prescribing patterns for SSRIs changed following warnings issued by United Kingdom and United States drug advisory bodies on the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Recent studies shed further light on the safety profile of SSRIs with adolescents.; Objective: To provide a narrative review of the physical and psychiatric side effects of SSRIs as reported by adolescents. To provide GPs with practical advice regarding the prevalence and nature of side effects of SSRIs when prescribed for adolescents.; Discussion: The research literature suggests that adolescents taking SSRIs are at a small, but increased, risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The prescribing GP needs to be aware of a number of potential side effects and interactions. Monitoring for common physical side effects and possible emerging suicidal ideas and behaviours, especially early in treatment, is recommended.;Suicidal Ideation*, Suicide, Attempted*, Mental Disorders/*chemically induced, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects, Abdominal Pain/chemically induced, Adolescent, Headache/chemically induced, Humans, Nausea/chemically induced, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/chemically induced, Vomiting/chemically induced","Gordon, Michael & Melvin, Glenn",0,493
494,Gender differences in depression and response to psychotropic medication,"Background: In the United States, depression is approximately twice as common among women as among men, across all age groups.; Objective: This review examines gender differences in the epidemiology and clinical presentation of depression, and explores whether women respond differently than men to antidepressant medications.; Methods: This is a selective review focusing on current issues in the management of depression, with particular attention to gender differences in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease.; Results: Women are more likely than men to have atypical symptoms of depression (eg, hypersomnia, hyperphagia), to have comorbid anxiety disorders, and to attempt suicide. Women are also more likely to have seasonal affective disorder. Mood and anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to the menstrual cycle do not often represent genuine premenstrual dysphoria, but when premenstrual dysphoric disorder does occur, its impact on quality of life is similar to that of major depressive disorder. There is ongoing controversy about whether men and women respond equally well to antidepressant medications, and preliminary evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more effective in the presence of estrogen. Depression affects about 10% of pregnant women. Antidepressant medication should be considered during pregnancy if depression is moderate or severe, or if withdrawal of maintenance medication is likely to result in recurrent depression. The potential benefits of using antidepressant medications in a pregnant or breastfeeding woman should be balanced against the potential risks to the newborn. Because of the risk of neonatal withdrawal syndrome, SSRIs should be used at the lowest effective dose during the third trimester of pregnancy and should be tapered before delivery.; Conclusions: Continuing research is needed to determine how gender influences the risk, clinical presentation, and response to treatment of depression. Exploration of sex differences in animals and humans should aid in efforts to treat depression as an organic disorder rather than a psychological maladaptation.;Sex Factors*, Treatment Outcome*, Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Depression/*drug therapy, Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects, Breast Feeding, Depression/classification, Depression/diagnosis, Depression/epidemiology, Depression, Postpartum/prevention & control, Female, Humans, Life Change Events, Male, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications","Gorman, Jack M",0,494

496,Prevalence and natural history of neuropsychiatric syndromes in veteran hospice patients,"Context: Prospective studies are needed to adequately describe the overall impact of neuropsychiatric syndromes on the course of hospice enrollment in outpatient settings. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and natural history of delirium, cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation (SI) in community-dwelling veteran hospice patients. Methods: Home hospice patients were visited regularly from enrollment until their deaths, study withdrawal, or discharge from hospice. Family caregivers gave consent for those with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores less than or equal to 23. Measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV for depression (past and current) and alcohol abuse; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; MMSE; and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). A clinician-rated CAM item documented sleep disturbance, and participants were asked about SI at each visit. Results: The median length of hospice enrollment was 81 days. Of 88 participants, 77 (88%) experienced at least one neuropsychiatric syndrome. Cognitive impairment was prevalent, with 60 (68%) registering MMSE less than or equal to 23 at least once. More than half of the participants developed delirium; the proportion with delirium, any cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, or any neuropsychiatric syndrome increased significantly from first to last study visit. Twelve (14%) participants had SI during the study, and 30 (34%) participants were affected by depression overall. Sixteen patients who were not depressed on admission subsequently developed depression. Anxiety was present in 14 (16%) on at least one study visit. Active alcohol abuse remained relatively stable (8%) across visits. Conclusions: Psychiatric syndromes are highly prevalent in hospice patients. Systematic case finding of psychiatric disorders may be necessary to improve quality of life in the last months of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

497,European guidelines on managing adverse effects of medication for ADHD,"The safety of ADHD medications is not fully known. Concerns have arisen about both a lack of contemporary-standard information about medications first licensed several decades ago, and signals of possible harm arising from more recently developed medications. These relate to both relatively minor adverse effects and extremely serious issues such as sudden cardiac death and suicidality. A guidelines group of the European Network for Hyperkinetic Disorders (EUNETHYDIS) has therefore reviewed the literature, recruited renowned clinical subspecialists and consulted as a group to examine these concerns. Some of the effects examined appeared to be minimal in impact or difficult to distinguish from risk to untreated populations.

498,Effect of reboxetine on major depressive disorder in breast cancer patients: an open-label study,"Background: Depression is a common disorder in cancer patients, and it is associated with reduced quality of life, abnormal illness behavior, pain, and suicide risk. A few studies have investigated the effects of tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors in cancer patients. No data are available regarding the use of reboxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been shown to be safe (e.g., absence of clinically significant drug-drug interactions and cytochrome P450 metabolism) and effective in the treatment of depressed patients, including those with medical illness (e.g., Parkinson's disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection).; Method: The effects of reboxetine were investigated in 20 breast cancer patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder in an open, prospective 8-week trial. Severity of depression was assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Psychiatric symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI]), styles of coping with cancer (Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer [Mini-MAC]), quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 [EORTC-QLQ-C30]), and Clinical Global Impressions scale scores were also monitored.; Results: At 8 weeks, a significant (p <.01) reduction was observed in HAM-D scores, several BSI dimension scores, and Mini-MAC hopelessness and anxious preoccupation scores. A significant (p <.05) improvement from baseline to endpoint was found on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 subfactors emotional, cognitive, dyspnea, sleep, and global. Discontinuation was necessary in 1 subject because of hypomanic switch and in another because of side effects (tachycardia, tension).

499,"Buddy-to-Buddy, a citizen soldier peer support program to counteract stigma, PTSD, depression, and suicide","Citizen soldiers (National Guard and Reserves) represent approximately 40% of the two million armed forces deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. Twenty-five to forty percent of them develop PTSD, clinical depression, sleep disturbances, or suicidal thoughts. Upon returning home, many encounter additional stresses and hurdles to obtaining care: specifically, many civilian communities lack military medical/psychiatric facilities; financial, job, home, and relationship stresses have evolved or have been exacerbated during deployment; uncertainty has increased related to future deployment; there is loss of contact with military peers; and there is reluctance to recognize and acknowledge mental health needs that interfere with treatment entry and adherence. Approximately half of those needing help are not receiving it. To address this constellation of issues, a private-public partnership was formed under the auspices of the Welcome Back Veterans Initiative. In Michigan, the Army National Guard teamed with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University to develop innovative peer-to-peer programs for soldiers (Buddy-to-Buddy) and augmented programs for military families. Goals are to improve treatment entry, adherence, clinical outcomes, and to reduce suicides.

Design: Meta-analysis of 74,406 eC-SSRS assessments completed between September 2009 and December 2012. Setting: Thirty-three clinical research studies that used the electronic Columbiaâ€“Suicide Severity Rating Scale to assess suicidal ideation and behavior at baseline and prospectively during follow-up visits. Participants: Records from 6,760 patients with psychiatric disorders (opioid dependence, generalized anxiety, major depressive, and posttraumatic stress disorders) and 2,077 nonpsychiatric disorder patients (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, human immunodeficiency virus, insomnia, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, pain/back pain, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, restless leg syndrome) were analyzed. Measurements: Electronic Columbiaâ€“Suicide Severity Rating Scale assessment of lifetime suicidal ideation (5 severity levels) and suicidal behavior (4 types) at baseline and prospectively reported suicidal behavior during study participation. Results: Increasingly more severe lifetime suicidal ideation at baseline was associated with a progressively greater likelihood of prospectively reported suicidal behavior during study participation. Intent to act on suicidal ideation was most predictive of reports of suicidal behavior. Reports of lifetime suicidal behaviors at baseline also predicted subsequent suicidal behavior, and multiple lifetime behaviors monotonically increased prospective risk of suicidal behavior. Baseline suicidal ideation and behavior predicted future suicidal behavior in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric trials. Conclusions: Lifetime reports of suicidal ideation and/or behavior at baseline significantly increased risk of prospectively reporting suicidal behavior during research trial participation in both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric patients. Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and behavior is higher among psychiatric patients, but also presents a safety concern among nonpsychiatric patients when reported.

The authors raise an excellent question regarding the effects of organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposure on the cognitive and behavioral functioning of Hispanic children living in agricultural communities as well as provide a hypothesis for future research. We did, however, note a few shortcomings. In the attempt to associate OP exposure with cognitive and behavioral deficiency, we question the statement made about Table I-'Demographic Characteristics of the Originally Exposed and Non-exposed Groups,' in which the authors conclude that both had 'nearly identical demographic characteristics.' It has been well established that socioeconomic status (SES) has a major, if not the greatest, impact on childhood achievement. We feel that the authors' conclusions that short-term OP pesticide exposure has deleterious effects on multiple aspects of children's cognitive and behavioral functioning are not supported by their data.

The S had no history of psychiatric illness but exhibited a dysthymic mood after exposure to recurrent physical and psychological violence at age 16 yrs. At admission, the S suffered from dysthymic mood coupled with concentration difficulties, diminished drive, poor affects, and generally shortened and interrupted sleep. The S presented recurrent impulsive SIB without suicidal intent, fulfilling Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for dysthymia and borderline personality disorder. Results show that treatment with naltrexone reduced feelings of tenseness; self-injurious behavior ceased entirely. The S did not show any autodestructive behavior over a 32-wk follow-up period. It is concluded that naltrexone is effective in reducing SIB in individuals with psychiatric disorders not associated with mental retardation.

503,The role of rumination in illness trajectories in youth: linking trans-diagnostic processes with clinical staging models,"Research in developmental psychopathology and clinical staging models has increasingly sought to identify trans-diagnostic biomarkers or neurocognitive deficits that may play a role in the onset and trajectory of mental disorders and could represent modifiable treatment targets. Less attention has been directed at the potential role of cognitive-emotional regulation processes such as ruminative response style. Maladaptive rumination (toxic brooding) is a known mediator of the association between gender and internalizing disorders in adolescents and is increased in individuals with a history of early adversity. Furthermore, rumination shows moderate levels of genetic heritability and is linked to abnormalities in neural networks associated with emotional regulation and executive functioning. This review explores the potential role of rumination in exacerbating the symptoms of alcohol and substance misuse, and bipolar and psychotic disorders during the peak age range for illness onset. Evidence shows that rumination not only amplifies levels of distress and suicidal ideation, but also extends physiological responses to stress, which may partly explain the high prevalence of physical and mental co-morbidity in youth presenting to mental health services. In summary, the normative developmental trajectory of rumination and its role in the evolution of mental disorders and physical illness demonstrates that rumination presents a detectable, modifiable trans-diagnostic risk factor in youth.; Suicidal Ideation*, Adolescent Behavior/*physiology, Mental Disorders/*physiopathology, Stress, Psychological/*physiopathology, Substance-Related Disorders/*physiopathology, Thinking/*physiology, Adolescent, Humans, Models, Theoretical, Brooding*, clinical staging*, mental disorders*, rumination*, trans-diagnostic*, youth*","Grierson, A.

The study responds to gaps in the research literature to better understand community intervention needs of reservists. About half (48%) of the soldiers reported one or two problems, mostly those of psychological well-being, such as feelings of anger and frustration, upsetting memories, and troubled sleep (34% of the study sample), followed by problems of social support (18%), alcohol use (17%), feelings of isolation including suicidal thoughts (13%), and financial difficulties (11%). Having engaged in direct combat and having wounded or killed someone showed positive relationships with reported problems. One-third (35%) of soldiers who reported having used services went to one service and, generally, soldiers went to services related to their expressed problems. Variance in self-reported problems explained by service use was low, suggesting unsought postdeployment services.

Daytime sleepiness in AWE is more often due to undiagnosed sleep disorders. Sleep deprivation is an important provoker of seizures in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Abnormalities in frontal lobe executive function with difficulties making advantageous decisions may explain failure of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients to adhere to treatment recommendations and regulate their sleep habits. Sleep architecture in AWE is more likely to be abnormal if seizures are poorly controlled or occur during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common in AWE who are man, older, heavier, or whose seizures are poorly controlled.

506,Impact of lifetime traumatic experiences on suicidality and likelihood of conversion in a cohort of individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis,"Recent research suggests that trauma history (TH) is a strong socio-environmental risk factor for the development of psychosis. While reported rates of childhood trauma are higher among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis than in the general population, little research has explored the effects of trauma upon the severity of attenuated positive symptoms. We aimed to explore the specific relationships between TH and baseline symptom severity; likelihood of conversion to full-blown psychosis; suicidal ideation (SI); and suicidal behavior (SB) in a cohort of 200 help-seeking CHR individuals. Participants were evaluated every three months for up to two years using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS). More trauma history was reported by females and Hispanic/Latino participants, while age and race did not significantly distinguish those with and without TH. Individuals with TH reported higher rates of SI and SB than those without. While TH was positively associated with several SIPS subscales, including Unusual Thought Content, Perceptual Abnormalities/Hallucinations, Bizarre Thinking, Sleep Disturbances, and Dysphoric Mood, and negatively associated with Expressed Emotion, results indicated that TH was not significantly related to conversion to psychosis. Moreover, baseline SI was unrelated to conversion and baseline DSM diagnosis, with the exception of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). These results suggest that traumatic experiences may significantly impact the severity of attenuated positive symptoms and suicidality in the CHR state, providing new windows for further research and potential intervention.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

508,SSRI versus bupropion effects on symptom clusters in suicidal depression: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial,"Objective: Identifying the depression symptoms most closely associated with suicidal thoughts and which medications provide the fastest depression relief may help suicide prevention.; Method: Post hoc analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, 8-week clinical trial of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine controlled release (n = 36) versus the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion extended release (n = 38) was conducted in patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder and past suicide attempt or current suicidal thoughts. Treatment effects on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory symptom clusters were compared. We hypothesized that paroxetine would demonstrate a superior effect on nonsuicidal, affective/cognitive depression symptom clusters that our prior work found to be associated with suicidal thoughts and attempts. Data were collected from February 2005 to January 2010.; Results: There was a treatment main effect on HDRS psychic depression (depressed mood, guilt, retardation, helpless, hopeless, worthless) (estimate = -2.2; 95% CI, -3.2 to -1.1; t67.16 = -4.01; P < .001), one of the clusters most strongly correlated to suicidal ideation. The net drug effect demonstrated that mean psychic depression score was 2.2 points lower after 1 week of paroxetine compared to bupropion treatment. The significance level of this effect was P < .001 at weeks 1 and 2, P = .012 at week 3 and P = .051 at week 4. Results for other depression scale factors were nonsignificant (P > .05).; Conclusions: The results require replication but suggest a pathway by which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment may exert a stronger effect compared with norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor treatment on reduction of suicidal thoughts during initial weeks of pharmacotherapy in these higher risk patients.; Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00429169.; Â© Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Suicidal Ideation*, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use, Bupropion/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder, Major/*psychology, Paroxetine/*therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Suicide, Attempted/*prevention & control, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects, Bupropion/adverse effects, Delayed-Action Preparations, Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Paroxetine/adverse effects, Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical data, Psychometrics, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects, Young Adult","Grunebaum, Michael F; Keilp, John G; Ellis, Steven P; Sudol, Katherin; Bauer, Neal; Burke, Ainsley K; Oquendo, Maria A & Mann, J John",0,508
509,Agomelatine versus other antidepressive agents for major depression,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD), or depression, is a syndrome characterised by a number of behavioural, cognitive and emotional features. It is most commonly associated with a sad or depressed mood, a reduced capacity to feel pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, loss of energy, altered sleep patterns, weight fluctuations, difficulty in concentrating and suicidal ideation. There is a need for more effective and better tolerated antidepressants to combat this condition. Agomelatine was recently added to the list of available antidepressant drugs; it is a novel antidepressant that works on melatonergic (MT1 and MT2), 5-HT 2B and 5-HT2C receptors. Because the mechanism of action is claimed to be novel, it may provide a useful, alternative pharmacological strategy to existing antidepressant drugs.; Objectives: The objective of this review was 1) to determine the efficacy of agomelatine in alleviating acute symptoms of major depressive disorder in comparison with other antidepressants, 2) to review the acceptability of agomelatine in comparison with other antidepressant drugs, and, 3) to investigate the adverse effects of agomelatine, including the general prevalence of side effects in adults.; Search Methods: We searched the Cochrane Collaboration's Depression,Â AnxietyÂ andÂ NeurosisÂ Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 31 July 2013. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 onwards), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and PsycINFO (1967 onwards). We checked reference lists of relevant studies together with reviews and regulatory agency reports. No restrictions on date, language or publication status were applied to the search. Servier Laboratories (developers of agomelatine) and other experts in the field were contacted for supplemental data.; Selection Criteria: Randomised controlled trials allocating adult participants with major depression to agomelatine versus any other antidepressive agent.; Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.; Main Results: A total of 13 studies (4495 participants) were included in this review. Agomelatine was compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), namely paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), venlafaxine. Participants were followed up for six to 12 weeks. Agomelatine did not show any advantage or disadvantage over the other antidepressants for our primary outcome, response to treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08, P value 0.75 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16, P value 0.16 compared to venlafaxine). Also, agomelatine showed no advantage or disadvantage over other antidepressants for remission (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01, P value 0.07 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, P value 0.73 compared to venlafaxine). Overall, agomelatine appeared to be better tolerated than venlafaxine in terms of lower rates of drop outs (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67, P value 0.0005), and showed the same level of tolerability as SSRIs (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, P value 0.44). Agomelatine induced a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64, P value 0.007).With regard to the quality of the body of evidence, there was a moderate risk of bias for all outcomes, due to the number of included unpublished studies. There was some heterogeneity, particularly between published and unpublished studies. The included studies were conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, thus limiting the generalisability of the results to primary care settings. With regard to precision, the efficacy outcomes were precise, but the tolerability outcomes were mostly imprecise. Publication bias was variable and depended on the outcome of the trial. Our review included unpublished studies, and we think that this reduced the impact of publication bias. The overall methodological quality of the studies was not very good. Almost all of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures agomelatine (Servier), and some of these were unpublished. Attempts to contact the pharmaceutical company Servier for additional information on all unpublished studies were unsuccessful.; Authors' Conclusions: Agomelatine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Agomelatine was better tolerated than paroxetine and venlafaxine in terms of overall side effects, and fewer participants treated with agomelatine dropped out of the trials due to side effects compared to sertraline and venlafaxine, but data were limited because the number of included studies was small. We found evidence that compared agomelatine with only a small number of other active antidepressive agents, and there were only a few trials for each comparison, which limits the generalisability of the results. Moreover, the overall methodological quality of the studies was low, and, therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the efficacy and tolerability of agomelatine.;Acetamides/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Acetamides/adverse effects, Adult, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects, Humans, Melatonin/agonists, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects","Guaiana, Giuseppe; Gupta, Sumeet; Chiodo, Debbie; Davies, Simon J C; Haederle, Katja & Koesters, Markus",0,509
510,"An Internet-based symptom questionnaire that is reliable, valid, and available to psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists","The Neuropsych Questionnaire (NPQ) addresses 2 important clinical issues: how to screen patients for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders quickly and efficiently, and how to acquire independent verification of a patient's complaints. The NPQ is available over the Internet in adult and pediatric versions. The adult version of the NPQ consists of 207 simple questions about common symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. The NPQ scores patient and/or observer responses in terms of 20 symptom clusters: inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, learning problems, memory, anxiety, panic, agoraphobia, obsessions and compulsions, social anxiety, depression, mood instability, mania, aggression, psychosis, somatization, fatigue, sleep, suicide, pain, and substance abuse. The NPQ is reliable (patients tested twice, patient-observer pairs, 2 observers) and discriminates patients with different diagnoses. Scores generated by the NPQ correlate reasonably well with commonly used rating scales, and the test is sensitive to the effects of treatment. The NPQ is suitable for initial patient evaluations, and a short form is appropriate for follow-up assessment. The availability of a comprehensive computerized symptom checklist can help to make the day-to-day practice of psychiatry, neurology, and neuropsychology more objective.;Internet*, Surveys and Questionnaires*, Neuropsychology/*instrumentation, Psychotic Disorders/*diagnosis, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders, Neuropsychology/trends, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, United States","Gualtieri, C Thomas",1,510
511,Identifying Chinese Microblog Users With High Suicide Probability Using Internet-Based Profile and Linguistic Features: Classification Model,"Background: Traditional offline assessment of suicide probability is time consuming and difficult in convincing at-risk individuals to participate. Identifying individuals with high suicide probability through online social media has an advantage in its efficiency and potential to reach out to hidden individuals, yet little research has been focused on this specific field.; Objective: The objective of this study was to apply two classification models, Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) and Random Forest (RF), to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of identifying high suicide possibility microblog users in China through profile and linguistic features extracted from Internet-based data.; Methods: There were nine hundred and nine Chinese microblog users that completed an Internet survey, and those scoring one SD above the mean of the total Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) score, as well as one SD above the mean in each of the four subscale scores in the participant sample were labeled as high-risk individuals, respectively. Profile and linguistic features were fed into two machine learning algorithms (SLR and RF) to train the model that aims to identify high-risk individuals in general suicide probability and in its four dimensions. Models were trained and then tested by 5-fold cross validation; in which both training set and test set were generated under the stratified random sampling rule from the whole sample. There were three classic performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 measure) and a specifically defined metric Screening Efficiency"" that were adopted to evaluate model effectiveness.; Results: Classification performance was generally matched between SLR and RF. Given the best performance of the classification models we were able to retrieve over 70% of the labeled high-risk individuals in overall suicide probability as well as in the four dimensions. Screening Efficiency of most models varied from 1/4 to 1/2. Precision of the models was generally below 30%.; Conclusions: Individuals in China with high suicide probability are recognizable by profile and text-based information from microblogs. Although there is still much space to improve the performance of classification models in the future this study may shed light on preliminary screening of risky individuals via machine learning algorithms which can work side-by-side with expert scrutiny to increase efficiency in large-scale-surveillance of suicide probability from online social media.; ""Chinese, classification model, microblog, suicide probability","Guan, Li; Hao, Bibo; Cheng, Qijin; Yip, Paul Sf & Zhu, Tingshao",1,511
512,Central serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor dysfunction in depression and epilepsy: the missing link?,"5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors (5-HT2A-Rs) are G-protein coupled receptors. In agreement with their location in the brain, they have been implicated not only in various central physiological functions including memory, sleep, nociception, eating and reward behaviors, but also in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Interestingly, a bidirectional link between depression and epilepsy is suspected since patients with depression and especially suicide attempters have an increased seizure risk, while a significant percentage of epileptic patients suffer from depression. Such epidemiological data led us to hypothesize that both pathologies may share common anatomical and neurobiological alteration of the 5-HT2A signaling. After a brief presentation of the pharmacological properties of the 5-HT2A-Rs, this review illustrates how these receptors may directly or indirectly control neuronal excitability in most networks involved in depression and epilepsy through interactions with the monoaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions. It also synthetizes the preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the role of these receptors in antidepressant and antiepileptic responses.; 5-HT, 5-HT2A receptor, antidepressants, antipsychotics, depression, epilepsy","Guiard, Bruno P. & Di Giovanni, Giuseppe",0,512
513,First-episode psychosis induced by pregabalin withdrawal: A case report,"Pregabalin is a novel isomer of gamma-aminobutyric acid that functions as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is used daily in medical practice for treating neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and partial seizures. Due to its anti-glutamatergic effects, it poses a potential addiction risk. For example, an abrupt discontinuation of this substance may cause patients to exhibit physical withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and diarrhoea. However, there is no information in the literature that addresses whether the rapid discontinuation of pregabalin can cause psychosis to occur. Here we presented a 20-year-old patient with his first episode of psychosis that was likely attributable to his withdrawal from a high dosage pregabalin. He lacked physical signs of withdrawal; however, a psychiatric examination was conducted. It was determined that the patient was experiencing paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and mutism. Furthermore, he had engaged in self-mutilative actions and had attempted suicide. Due to the short time frame between the rapid discontinuation of a relatively large dose of pregabalin and the onset of the patientâ€™s first episode of psychosis, it is likely that the psychotic episode was triggered by the cessation of the medication. This is the first known case of psychosis that was caused by the rapid withdrawal of pregabalin to be discussed in the literature. The results of this clinical case may guide clinicians to recognize the symptoms of acute pregabalin withdrawal.

514,Depressive symptoms in hypothyroid disorder with some observations on biochemical correlates,"Lumbar punctures and ratings of depressive symptoms were done in 16 hypothyroid outpatients before and during L-thyroxine therapy (lasting 1-12 mo). Before treatment, the most prominent symptoms were concentration difficulties, lassitude, and reduced sexual interest. All patients suffered from sleep disturbances. Suicidal thoughts did not occur at all. Inner tension was negatively correlated with the anxiogenic cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) in the CSF, while reduced sexual interest was negatively correlated with CSF tryptophan. Furthermore, failing memory correlated negatively with T3 as well as T4 in serum. A positive correlation was found between failing memory and serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All patients improved significantly during treatment. No biochemical correlates were found during treatment. In conclusion, hypothyroidism is associated with major depressive symptoms. CSF CCK-4 and tryptophan, as well as serum thyroid hormones, may constitute biochemical correlates for some of these symptoms.

515,"Sleep and suicide: An analysis of a cohort of 394,000 Taiwanese adults","Background: Sleep problems may lead to, or be symptomatic of, depression and other mental illnesses yet few studies have investigated their association with suicide risk. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Taiwan. Participants: 393,983 men and women aged 20 or above participating in the MJ health check-up programme. Results: There were 335 suicides over a mean of 7.4 years follow-up. There was a reverse J-shaped association between sleep duration and suicide risk. When compared with those sleeping 6-8 h per night the adjusted hazard ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for suicide associated with 0-4, 4-6 and >8 h sleep were 3.5 (2.0-6.1), 1.5 (1.1-1.9) and 1.5 (1.1-2.0), respectively. People requiring sleeping pills to get to sleep (1.2 % participants) were at over 11-fold increased risk; difficulty falling asleep (11.5 % participants), frequent dreaming (16.7 %) and being easily awoken (30.6 %) were associated with a 2.0-, 1.6- and 1.3-fold increased risk of suicide, respectively. Conclusions: Less than 6 h sleep duration, sleep disturbances and reported use of sleep medicines are markers of suicide risk. Sleep problems should be assessed when evaluating suicide risk.

516,Prevalence and correlates of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents: a cross-sectional survey study,"Study Objective: To investigate the prevalence and the correlates of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents and to examine the association between the two problems.; Design: Cross-sectional survey.; Participants: A total of 3186 school students in grades 7-12 were sampled from the schools in Guangdong. A stratified-cluster random-sampling strategy was used to select the schools.; Main Outcome Measures: A self-administered questionnaire was used. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) was used to assess the occurrence of sleep disturbance, and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D) was used to identify whether individuals had depressive symptoms.; Results: The mean PSQI global score was 8.7 (Â±2.4) points, and 39.6% of the total sample had sleep disturbance. The mean CES-D score of students was 15.2 (Â±9.4) points, and 6.4% of the students had depressive symptoms. Additionally, girls and older adolescents were more likely to suffer from sleep disturbance, and the students who had depressive symptoms were 2.47 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.79) times more likely to suffer from sleep disturbance. Factors that were correlated with sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were having a poor relationship with teachers, feeling lonely, suicide ideation and having run away from home.; Conclusions: Sleep disturbance was determined to be more prevalent among Chinese adolescents with depressive symptoms.

517,"Association between problematic Internet use, sleep disturbance, and suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents","Background and Aims: This large-scale study aimed to test (a) associations of problematic Internet use (PIU) and sleep disturbance with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents and (b) whether sleep disturbance mediates the association between PIU and suicidal behavior.; Methods: Data were drawn from the 2017 National School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. A total of 20,895 students' questionnaires were qualified for analysis. The Young's Internet Addiction Test was used to assess PIU, and level of sleep disturbance was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multilevel logistic regression models and path models were utilized in analyses.; Results: Of the total sample, 2,864 (13.7%) reported having suicidal ideation, and 537 (2.6%) reported having suicide attempts. After adjusting for control variables and sleep disturbance, PIU was associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation (AORâ€‰=â€‰1.04, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.03-1.04) and suicide attempts (AORâ€‰=â€‰1.03, 95% CIâ€‰= 1.02-1.04). Findings of the path models showed that the standardized indirect effects of PIU on suicidal ideation (standardized Î² estimateâ€‰=â€‰0.092, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.082-0.102) and on suicide attempts (standardized Î² estimateâ€‰=â€‰0.082, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.068-0.096) through sleep disturbance were significant. Conversely, sleep disturbance significantly mediated the association of suicidal behavior on PIU.; Discussion and Conclusions: There may be a complex transactional association between PIU, sleep disturbance, and suicidal behavior. The estimates of the mediator role of sleep disturbance provide evidence for the current understanding of the mechanism of the association between PIU and suicidal behavior. Possible concomitant treatment services for PIU, sleep disturbance, and suicidal behavior were recommended.; adolescents, mediation effects, problematic Internet use, sleep disturbance, suicidal behavior","Guo, Lan; Luo, Min; Wang, Wan-Xin; Huang, Guo-Liang; Xu, Yan; Gao, Xue; Lu, Ci-Yong & Zhang, Wei-Hong",1,517
518,Associations of Childhood Maltreatment with Single and Multiple Suicide Attempts among Older Chinese Adolescents,"Objectives: To test, among older Chinese adolescents, the associations of childhood maltreatment with single and multiple suicide attempts and whether these associations vary in relation to the presence of sleep disturbance.; Study Design: We analyzed data collected from 10th to 12th graders from 7 randomly selected provinces of China in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. There were 83â€‰200 students who were invited to participate, and 75â€‰715 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for the survey. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations of childhood maltreatment with suicide attempts.; Results: Compared with no suicide attempts, each type of adjusted childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, or emotional neglect) was associated with an increased risk of single and multiple suicide attempts (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). The magnitude of the aORs in multiple suicide attempters was greater than those in single suicide attempters. Moreover, the adjusted interaction effects for a single suicide attempt between each type of childhood maltreatment and sleep disturbance were all statistically significant in the multivariable multinomial logistic regression models (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). However, the adjusted interaction effects for multiple suicide attempts were not significant (Pâ€‰>â€‰.05).; Conclusions: Maltreatment during one's childhood is associated with an increased risk of single and multiple suicide attempts among older Chinese adolescents.

519,Suicide attempt and externalizing behaviours in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Possible role of the activating effect of antidepressants,"This letter discusses the possible role of the activating effect of antidepressants in suicide attempt and externalizing behaviours in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Suicide risk and externalizing behaviours in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be difficult to manage. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants including paroxetine and sertraline are the only US Food and Drug Administration approved pharmacotherapies for PTSD. The case studies discusses suggests that antidepressants may enhance the emotional regulation difficulties in PTSD, which in turn may contribute to increased suicidality and externalizing behaviours in some patients. Hyperarousal symptoms in PTSD patients (e.g. increasing insomnia, panic attacks, irritability) should be monitored carefully and managed before treatment with antidepressants is initiated.

520,Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity is Directly Related to Suicidal Ideation in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Study Objectives: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with suicidal ideation (SI) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are no studies of OSA diagnosed by sleep study and SI in patients with PTSD.; Methods: Forty consenting civilians with PTSD (38 female, mean Â± standard deviation age: 44.60 Â± 12.73) underwent a Level 3 home sleep apnea test (WatchPAT200; Itamar Medical, Israel). OSA severity was measured with the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) (number of apneas, hypopneas and respiratory effort related arousals per hour). SI was measured with Items 9, 35, 39, and 50 of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Other patient-rated measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PTSD Addendum modified to include only Items 1c, 1e, 1f, and 1g that address nightmares.; Results: The RDI (r = .757, P < .001) and oxygen desaturation index (r = .633, P < .001) were directly correlated to SI. Multiple regression analysis using SI as the dependent variable and patient-rated measures as independent variables revealed only RDI (Î² = .480, t = 4.167, P < .001) and BDI-II (Î² = .469, t = 3.375, P = .002) as predictors of SI, with adjusted R2 = 0.718. In patients with RDI < 30 events/h (n = 37) correlation of SI with RDI (r = .511, P = .001) but not ODI (r = .312, P = .060) remained significant. Multiple regression analysis (when RDI < 30 events/h) revealed only BDI-II (Î² = .603, t = 3.492, P = .002), and not RDI (Î² = .247, t = 1.723, P = .096) as a significant predictor of SI.; Conclusions: OSA severity in PTSD was directly related to SI. Depression was a significant mediator in the relationship between RDI and SI, with OSA-related intermittent hypoxemia possibly contributing to this relationship only in severe OSA.; Â© 2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.OSA, PTSD, autonomic nervous system, hypoxia, oxidative stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychological trauma, sleep apnea, suicidal ideation, suicide","Gupta, Madhulika A. & Jarosz, Patricia",1,520
521,Suicidal behaviors in the dermatology patient,"An assessment of suicidal behaviors in the dermatology patient may be necessary in several situations: (1) in the presence of psychiatric comorbidity (major depressive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, substance use disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder), encountered in up to 30% of dermatology patients; (2) when dermatologic symptoms (dysmorphophobia dermatitis artefacta) represent psychiatric pathologic conditions; (3) when psychosocial stressors (bereavement, interpersonal violence) increase the risk of suicidal behavior and exacerbate stress-reactive dermatoses (psoriasis, acne); (4) in the presence of high disease burden (chronicity, increased disease severity); (5) in instances of significant pruritus or chronic sleep disruption; (6) in the presence of facial lesions or facial scarring; (7) when social exclusion or feelings of alienation arise secondary to the skin disorder; (8) with use of medications (retinoids, biologics) for which suicidal behavior has been implicated as a possible side effect; and (9) when treating psychiatric patients experiencing a serious reaction to psychotropic medications (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and anticonvulsants). Suicide risk must be assessed within a demographic context because suicide rates rise rapidly in adolescents and young adults, among whom the prevalence of skin disorders associated with suicidal behaviors (acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) is also high, and suicide rates are increasing among white men, who tend to be overrepresented in dermatology clinical trials.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

522,Autism spectrum disorder and mental health comorbidity leading to prolonged inpatient admission,"CASE: Sam is a 6-year-old boy with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who recently relocated and has an appointment with you, his new pediatric clinician, to establish care. He was previously followed by a psychiatrist for 2 years for additional diagnoses of insomnia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability. He has tried and (apparently) failed multiple psychotropic trials including stimulants, nonstimulants, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. He has a delayed sleep onset and frequent night awakenings each night for the past 3 months, during which he 'screams, cries, and thrashes and can stay up for over an hour.' His behaviors are described as irritable, self-injurious, and aggressive with no clear pattern of triggers according to his mother. He is nonverbal and communicates by leading and rarely pointing. The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation. His mother is concerned that he is developing 'tolerance' to the regimen and wants to wean him off some of the medications. His mother is struggling to take care of the patient given his worsening behavior and body habitus (body mass index > 99%; z = 3.41). There is a family history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and autism. He has a 3-year-old sister, who is also diagnosed with ASD, though she is not as severely impacted. His mother's partner recently moved in along with 2 children of his own, aged 3 and 4 years. Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds. After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects. However, within a week of this, he was brought to the emergency department for continued self-injurious behavior and increased trouble with sleeping. His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors. Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home. Social work contacted local community mental health services to pursue outpatient resources and respite care options and sought inpatient pediatric psychiatry. After several failed attempts to find placement, he remained in pediatric inpatient care for 1 and a half months with no acute medical interventions other than his oral medications. He was finally accepted to the in-state pediatric psychiatric facility when a bed was available. During his week-long stay, he had further medication adjustments with a decrease in olanzapine and optimization of his clonidine dose. During his psychiatric hospital stay, care coordination succeeded in arranging center-based applied behavior analysis interventions and respite care and parent training for his family. Sam began to show improvement in his overall agitation and aggression, requiring less clonazepam, and his mother then maintained outpatient follow-up.

523,"Prediction of neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with long-term efavirenz therapy, using plasma drug level monitoring","Background: Data on long-term central nervous system (CNS) toxicity associated with efavirenz therapy are scarce, and risk factors remain largely unknown. We aimed to determine whether monitoring the plasma concentration of efavirenz could predict neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with long-term therapy with efavirenz.; Methods: We performed a longitudinal study involving 17 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects with virological suppression after at least 6 months of antiretroviral therapy with an efavirenz-containing regimen. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were measured at study entry and at different time points through an 18-month study period.; Results: Median duration of efavirenz therapy before study entry was 18 months (range, 6-27 months). Ten (58.8%) of the patients experienced CNS-related adverse effects, ranging from insomnia and abnormal dreams to depression with suicidal ideation. In 4 (23.5%) of the cases, CNS toxicity led to efavirenz discontinuation. Mean (+/- standard deviation) plasma levels were higher for patients experiencing neuropsychiatric symptoms (5.10 +/- 2.15 microg/mL vs. 2.79 +/- 1.31 microg/mL; P = .024). A plasma level of 2.74 microg/mL had a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 72% to predict CNS toxicity (area under the curve, 0.839; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.95; P < .0001). Patients having efavirenz plasma concentrations > 2.74 microg/mL at any time point of the study were 5.68 times more likely to experiencing CNS toxicity than were other patients (95% confidence interval, 1.97-16.37).; Conclusions: In patients with HIV infection receiving long-term therapy with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral regimens, CNS toxicity is related to efavirenz plasma levels.

524,"Physical activity, suicide risk factors, and suicidal ideation in a veteran sample","The association between current level of suicidal ideation and physical activity was tested in a broad sample of veterans seeking care from the Veterans Health Administration. It was hypothesized that the two variables would be significantly inversely related. It was further hypothesized that the relationship would be mediated by depressive symptoms, disturbed sleep, and a measure of heart rate variability based on existing research regarding physical activity and sleep. Due to the first hypothesis not being supported, the second could not be tested. Post hoc correlation analyses did find associations between physical activity and depressive symptoms, in expected directions, and are discussed. Possible explanations for the negative findings along with recommendations for future research to continue exploring links between suicide risk and physical activity are presented. We conclude by suggesting that physical activity may have promise as a risk reduction intervention and that prospective data are more likely to yield significant results than the crossâ€sectional methodology employed in the current study.

525,MENTAL HEALTH OF PHYSICIANS--NATIONWIDE REPRESENTATIVE STUDY FROM HUNGARY,"Background and Aim: Somatic and mental health and stress factors of physicians became an issue of growing interest in both national and international investigations. Our aim is to give an overview of the mental state of Hungarian physicians.; Methods: Cross-sectional, quantitative survey on a representative sample of Hungarian physicians (n = 4784). The control group was formed by the population group of a national survey conducted by Hungarostudy 2013"" (n = 2000).; Results: Suicidal thoughts (18.8% vs. 9.6% p < 0.001) the scores of Somatic Symptom Scale (PHQ-10 20.4% vs. 13.6% p < 0.001) were significantly higher among physicians. The suicidal attempts (1.9% vs. 3.5% p = 0.053) and BDI depression scores (7.9% vs. 29.5% p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the control group. High Perceived Stress Scale (PPS) scores occurred in 43.3% of the physicians sample and 43.4% of them had high scores in the Athenian Insomnia Scale (AIS). The young (< 35) female physicians showed significantly higher rates of suicidal thoughts higher scores of PHQ and PPS. In the young female cohort the AIS scores were significantly higher than of the other physicians.; Conclusions: Mental health of physicians (sleep disorders suicidal thoughts and psychosomatic symptoms) showed poorer results than the population data. BDI scores and the rate of suicidal attempts showed favourable trends.

526,Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for fibromyalgia syndrome,"Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction and fatigue. Patients often report high disability levels and poor quality of life (QOL). Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and improving quality of life.; Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) compared with placebo for treating FMS symptoms in adults.; Search Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2012), EMBASE (1980 to September 2012), www.clinicalstudyresults.org (U.S.-marketed pharmaceuticals) (to September 2012) and www.clinicaltrials.gov (to September 2012) for published and ongoing trials and examined the reference lists of reviewed articles.; Selection Criteria: We selected randomized, controlled trials of any formulation of SNRIs against placebo for the treatment of FMS in adults.; Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted the data from the included studies, and assessed the risks of bias of the studies. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.; Main Results: Ten studies were included with a total of 6038 participants. Five studies investigated duloxetine against placebo, and five investigated milnacipran against placebo. A total of 3611 participants were included into duloxetine or milnacipran groups and 2427 participants into placebo groups. The studies had a low risk of bias in general. Duloxetine and milnacipran had a small incremental effect over placebo in reducing pain (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29 to -0.18; 6.1% relative improvement). One-hundred and ninety-two participants per 1000 on placebo reported an at least 50% pain reduction compared to 280 per 1000 on SNRIs (Risk ratio (RR) 1.49, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.64; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 9 to 15). Duloxetine and milnacipran did not reduce fatigue substantially (SMD -0.14; 95% CI -0.19 to -0.08; 2.5% relative improvement; NNTB 17, 95% CI 12 to 29), and did not improve QOL substantially (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.14; 4.6% relative improvement; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 17) compared to placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between either duloxetine or milnacipran and placebo in reducing sleep problems (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.16 to 0.03; 2.5% relative improvement). One-hundred and seven participants per 1000 on placebo dropped out due to adverse events compared to 196 per 1000 on SNRIs. The dropout rate due to adverse events in the duloxetine and milnacipran groups was statistically significantly higher than in placebo groups (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.18; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 11, 95% CI 9 to 13). There was no statistically significant difference in serious adverse events between either duloxetine or milnacipran and placebo (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12).; Authors' Conclusions: The SNRIs duloxetine and milnacipran provided a small incremental benefit over placebo in reducing pain. The superiority of duloxetine and milnacipran over placebo in reducing fatigue and limitations of QOL was not substantial. Duloxetine and milnacipran were not superior to placebo in reducing sleep problems. The dropout rates due to adverse events were higher for duloxetine and milnacipran than for placebo. The most frequently reported symptoms leading to stopping medication were nausea, dry mouth, constipation, headache, somnolence/dizziness and insomnia. Rare complications of both drugs may include suicidality, liver damage, abnormal bleeding, elevated blood pressure and urinary hesitation.;Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Cyclopropanes/*therapeutic use, Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy, Norepinephrine/*metabolism, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Thiophenes/*therapeutic use, Adult, Duloxetine Hydrochloride, Humans, Quality of Life, Syndrome","HÃ¤user, Winfried; UrrÃºtia, Gerard; Tort, Sera; UÃ§eyler, Nurcan & Walitt, Brian",0,526
527,"Active multimodal psychotherapy in children and adolescents with suicidality: Description, evaluation and clinical profile","The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the clinical pattern of 14 youths with presenting suicidality, to describe an integrative treatment approach, and to estimate therapy effectiveness. Fourteen patients aged 10 to 18 years from a child and adolescent outpatient clinic in Stockholm were followed in a case series. The patients were treated with active multimodal psychotherapy. This consisted of mood charting by mood-maps, psycho-education, wellbeing practice and trauma resolution. Active techniques were psychodrama and body-mind focused techniques including eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. The patients were assessed before treatment, immediately after treatment and at 22 months post treatment with the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. The clinical pattern of the group was observed. After treatment there was a significant change towards normality in the Global Assessment of Functioning scale both immediately post-treatment and at 22 months. A clinical pattern, post trauma suicidal reaction, was observed with a combination of suicidality, insomnia, bodily symptoms and disturbed mood regulation. We conclude that in the post trauma reaction suicidality might be a presenting symptom in young people. Despite the shortcomings of a case series the results of this study suggest that a mood-map-based multimodal treatment approach with active techniques might be of value in the treatment of children and youth with suicidality.

528,Are Mental Health Effects of Internet Use Attributable to the Web-Based Content or Perceived Consequences of Usage? A Longitudinal Study of European Adolescents,"Background: Adolescents and young adults are among the most frequent Internet users, and accumulating evidence suggests that their Internet behaviors might affect their mental health. Internet use may impact mental health because certain Web-based content could be distressing. It is also possible that excessive use, regardless of content, produces negative consequences, such as neglect of protective offline activities.; Objective: The objective of this study was to assess how mental health is associated with (1) the time spent on the Internet, (2) the time spent on different Web-based activities (social media use, gaming, gambling, pornography use, school work, newsreading, and targeted information searches), and (3) the perceived consequences of engaging in those activities.; Methods: A random sample of 2286 adolescents was recruited from state schools in Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Questionnaire data comprising Internet behaviors and mental health variables were collected and analyzed cross-sectionally and were followed up after 4 months.; Results: Cross-sectionally, both the time spent on the Internet and the relative time spent on various activities predicted mental health (P<.001), explaining 1.4% and 2.8% variance, respectively. However, the consequences of engaging in those activities were more important predictors, explaining 11.1% variance. Only Web-based gaming, gambling, and targeted searches had mental health effects that were not fully accounted for by perceived consequences. The longitudinal analyses showed that sleep loss due to Internet use (ÃŸ=.12, 95% CI=0.05-0.19, P=.001) and withdrawal (negative mood) when Internet could not be accessed (ÃŸ=.09, 95% CI=0.03-0.16, P<.01) were the only consequences that had a direct effect on mental health in the long term. Perceived positive consequences of Internet use did not seem to be associated with mental health at all.; Conclusions: The magnitude of Internet use is negatively associated with mental health in general, but specific Web-based activities differ in how consistently, how much, and in what direction they affect mental health. Consequences of Internet use (especially sleep loss and withdrawal when Internet cannot be accessed) seem to predict mental health outcomes to a greater extent than the specific activities themselves. Interventions aimed at reducing the negative mental health effects of Internet use could target its negative consequences instead of the Internet use itself.; Trial Registration: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 65120704; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN65120704?q=&filters=recruitmentCountry:Lithuania&sort=&offset= 5&totalResults=32&page=1&pageSize=10&searchType=basic-search (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation/abcdefg).; Internet, addictive behavior, adolescent health, longitudinal study, mental health, problematic Internet use","HÃ¶kby, Sebastian; Hadlaczky, GergÃ¶; Westerlund, Joakim; Wasserman, Danuta; Balazs, Judit; Germanavicius, Arunas; MachÃ­n, NÃºria; Meszaros, Gergely; Sarchiapone, Marco; VÃ¤rnik, Airi; Varnik, Peeter; Westerlund, Michael & Carli, Vladimir",1,528
529,What is a rational antidepressant treatment for major depression in patients with parkinson's disease?,"Presents a case report of 62-year-old woman with mild dilated cardiomyopathy. At age 61, she was diagnosed with major depression and prescribed milnacipran without improvement of the symptoms. Four months later, she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) by a neurologist after developing motor symptoms, including resting tremor, rigidity, and gait disturbance. Although parkinsonian symptoms were well controlled with levodopa and pramipexole during 6 months, she had gradually developed insomnia, severe appetite and weight loss, loss of interest and suicidal ideation. Milnacipran was switched to mirtazapine over 2 weeks while keeping her anti-parkinsonian medication unchanged. After fixing mirtazapine, her depressive symptoms were improved without the exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms. She was discharged home and remained in remission at 1 month after hospitalization. Dopamine agonists (DA) are first-line therapy for motor symptoms and effective for depression in PD as well. According to the pharmacological profiles, mirtazapine appears to be a rational treatment option for depression in PD patients. Randomized clinical trials are warranted to confirm the effectiveness of mirtazapine in PD patients with depression.

530,Bedtimes and the blues: Evidence in support of improving adolescent sleep,"Comments on an article in the current issue of Sleep by J. Gangwisch et al. (see record [rid]2010-00720-014[/rid]), who examined the relationships between parent-set bedtimes, sleep duration, and adolescent depression. The current author notes that, in the absence of conducting an unrealistic and ethically questionable experimental study that repeatedly restricts teenagers' sleep for long enough to potentially induce depressive symptoms, establishing a causal link presents a creative challenge to the researcher. Gangwisch et al. rise to the challenge by using parentally set bedtimes as a quasi-experiment, thereby taking advantage of a large nationally representative longitudinal study, Add Health. the authors find that adolescents with bedtimes past midnight are 24% more likely to have depression and 20% more likely to have suicidal ideation compared to those with bedtimes earlier than 10PM. These results suggest that the mediating pathway is indeed related to sleep duration in teenagers. The results of these analyses should be interpreted with some caution, but despite the imperfect exogeneity of the parentally set bedtime measure, this work adds weight to the evidence that insufficient sleep may cause depression and suicidal ideation.

None had a history of previous psychiatric disorder, and all were taking greater than the maximum recommended dose of diazepam. Because the quality of the suicidal ideation in this syndrome differs from the usual indicators of suicidal intent, physicians should be alert to early symptoms of the syndrome and take measures to protect the patient against suicidal impulses. 6 case reports are included.

Severe anxiety, panic attacks, a depressed mood, a diagnosis of major affective disorder, recent loss of an interpersonal relationship, recent abuse of alcohol or illicit substances coupled with feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, global or partial insomnia, anhedonia, inability to maintain a job, and the recent onset of impulsive behavior were excellent predictors of suicidal behavior. The presence of a specific suicide plan or suicide note were not. Patients with managed care were overrepresented by 245% in the study.

The patient presented with a 3-yr history of recurrent sad mood, anhedonia, decreased concentration, insomnia, severe anorexia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, suicidal ideation, and auditory hallucinations. He had been unemployed for over 20 yrs due to neurological disability. Lyosomal enzyme assay findings revealed severe hexosaminidase A deficiency. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and electrodiagnostic studies were consistent with advanced cerebellar atrophy and motor neuron disease. The psychiatric diagnosis was major depressive disorder with psychotic and melancholic features secondary to adult GM2 gangliosidosis. The patient had a marked response to combined desipramine and lithium: complete resolution of both depressive and psychotic symptoms. No exacerbation in neurological symptoms was noted with psychotropic medication. At the time of last follow-up, 1 yr later, the patient remained free of major depressive or psychotic features.

534,Can botulinum toxin improve mood in depressed patients?,"Comments on an article by M. A. Wollmer et al. (see record [rid]2012-10701-002[/rid]). Depression has a number of significant symptoms such as depressed mood, lack of volition/energy, suicidal ideation, low concentration, sleep disturbance, anger, anxiety, psychomotor retardation, fear and sadness. In addition, various facial expressions such as frowning and sadness can also be easily recognized in depressed patients. In fact, major muscles involved in the development of such negative emotion have been reported in depressed patients, for instance, corrugators and procerus muscles in the glabellar regions of the face. Electromyography studies have also reported that depressed patients had overactivity of such grief muscles during different affective imagery paradigms. Furthermore, subjective emotion has also been found to be affected by differential facial expression via an image feedback system. Interestingly, anecdotal open-label studies have shown that botulinum toxin may have a role in treatment of depression and a recent randomized-placebo controlled study has also confirmed the effect of botulinum toxin in reduction of depressive symptoms for the first time. This article will discuss the putative role of botulinum toxin in a treatment of depression in the context of the clinical significance, limitations and future research directions.

535,"Health risk behaviors, violence exposure, and current asthma among adolescents in the United States","Background: Asthma may worsen during adolescence, due to both health risk behaviors and psychosocial stressors commonly encountered during this life stage.; Methods: Cross-sectional study of 24â€‰612 high school students who participated in the 2009 and 2011 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relation between self-reported health risk behaviors or psychosocial stressors and current asthma. Mediation analysis was performed to assess whether depressive symptoms or suicidal behavior contribute to the link between psychosocial stressors and asthma.; Results: Current asthma was reported by 13.1% of the study participants. In a multivariable analysis, female sex, obesity, shorter sleep duration, frequent soda/pop consumption, and marijuana use were each significantly associated with 14-36% increased odds of asthma. Any violent behavior (adjusted odds ratio [OR]â€‰=â€‰1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]â€‰=â€‰1.02-1.24), any victimization (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.43, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.29-1.58), any suicidal behavior (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.41, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.22-1.64) and having felt sad or hopeless in the past year (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.57, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.40-1.75) were each associated with current asthma. In a mediation analyses, having felt sad/hopeless and suicidal behaviors accounted for 21% and 14%, respectively, of the victimization-asthma association.; Conclusion: Potentially modifiable risk factors, including obesity, short sleep duration, frequent soda/pop consumption, and psychosocial stressors are associated with asthma in US adolescents.

536,Affective disorders as potential complication of anti-acne treatment with isotretinoin: A case series,"Objective: To analyse cases of 9 patients (18-27 yo) who were consequently admitted to our department and treated with affective disorders (AD) while undergoing isotretinoin (INN) therapy. Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire designed by the authors was used to analyse many variables related to demographic characteristics, dermatologic and psychiatrics symptoms, AD course and treatment, family history of mental disorders, building on medical histories of patients and their families, and available medical records. Results: Patients were diagnosed (DSM-IV-TR) with: a major depressive episode (4 patients), a recurrent major depressive episode (3), a bipolar mixed episode (1), and rapid cycling bipolar I disorder (1). The mean time from the first use of INN to: I. the onset of mental disorders was approximately 2 months (1â€“6 months), II. a visit with a psychiatrist was about 12 months (1â€“38 months). The predictors of occurrence of AD included a family history of AD and a prior episode of mental disorders. The onset of AD was in most cases preceded by prodromal symptoms such as headaches, sleep disorders, fatigue, drowsiness, or general weakness. Five patients reported suicidal ideation, four patients showed suicidal tendencies, and two persons attempted to commit suicide during the treatment. Conclusions: Psychiatrists should pay special attention to isotretinoin as a drug that may trigger episodes of AD, particularly in patients with a family history of AD or prior episodes of mental disorders. Isotretinoin therapy of patients with acne and a family history of AD or prior episodes of mental disorders requires special care and, if symptoms of depression develop or worsen during the INN treatment, collaboration between a dermatologist and a psychiatrist is needed.

537,Systematic clinical methodology for validating bipolar-II disorder: data in mid-stream from a French national multi-site study (EPIDEP),"Background: This paper presents the methodology and clinical data in mid-stream from a French multi-center study (EPIDEP) in progress on a national sample of patients with DSM-IV major depressive episode (MDE). The aim of EPIDEP is to show the feasibility of validating the spectrum of soft bipolar disorders by practising clinicians. In this report, we focus on bipolar II (BP-II).; Method: EPIDEP involves training 48 French psychiatrists in 15 sites; construction of a common protocol based on the criteria of DSM-IV and Akiskal (Soft Bipolarity), as well as criteria modified from the work of Angst (Hypomania Checklist), the Ahearn-Carroll Bipolarity Scale, HAM-D and Rosenthal Atypical Depression Scale; Semi-Structured Interview for Evaluation of Affective Temperaments (based on Akiskal-Mallya), self-rated Cyclothymia Scale (Akiskal), family history (Research Diagnostic Criteria); and prospective follow-up.; Results: Results are presented on 250 (of the 537) MDE patients studied thus far during the acute phase. The rate of BP-II disorder which was 22% at initial evaluation, nearly doubled (40%) by systematic evaluation. As expected from the selection of MDE by uniform criteria, inter-group comparison between BP-II vs unipolar showed no differences on the majority of socio-demographic parameters, clinical presentation and global intensity of depression. Despite such uniformity, key characteristics significantly differentiated BP-II from unipolar: younger age at onset of first depression, higher frequency of suicidal thoughts and hypersomnia during index episode, higher scores on Hypomania Checklist and cyclothymic and irritable temperaments, and higher switching rate under current treatment. Eighty-eight percent of cases assigned to cyclothymic temperament by clinicians (with a cut-off of 10/21 items on self-rated cyclothymia) were recognized as BP-II. Evaluation of this temperament by clinician and patient correlated at a highly significant level (r=0.73; p <0.0001). Cyclothymia and hypomania were also correlated significantly (r=0.51; p < 0.001).; Limitation: In a study conducted in diverse clinical settings, it was not possible to assure that clinicians making affective diagnoses were blind to the various temperamental measures. However, bias was minimized by the systematic and/or semi-structured nature of all evaluations.; Conclusion: With a systematic search for hypomania, 40% of major depressive episodes were classified as BP-II, of which only half were known to the clinicians at study entry. Cyclothymic temperamental dysregulation emerged as a robust clinical marker of BP-II disorder. These data indicate that clinicians in diverse practice settings can be trained to recognize soft bipolarity, leading to changes in diagnostic practice at a national level.;Bipolar Disorder/*classification, Depressive Disorder/*classification, Adult, Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Diagnosis, Differential, Feasibility Studies, Female, France, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatry/standards, Severity of Illness Index","Hantouche, E G; Akiskal, H S; Lancrenon, S; Allilaire, J F; Sechter, D; Azorin, J M; Bourgeois, M; Fraud, J P & ChÃ¢tenet-DuchÃªne, L",1,537
538,A prospective naturalistic study of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome,"Objective: Patients often develop neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and agitation after they have started taking an antidepressant, and this is thought to be associated with a potentially increased risk of suicide. However, the incidence of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome has not been fully investigated, and little has been reported on its predictors. The aim of this study was to survey the incidence of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome and clarify its predictors in a natural clinical setting. Materials and methods: Between January 2009 and July 2012, we prospectively surveyed 301 patients who had not taken any antidepressants for 1 month before presentation, and who were prescribed antidepressants for 1 month after their initial visit. Patients were classified as developing antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome if they experienced any symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, or mania during the first month. Results: Among the 301 patients, 21 (7.0%) developed antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome. Major depressive disorder and a diagnosis of mood disorder in first-degree relatives of patients were significantly associated with induction of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome (odds ratio 10.2, P = 0.001; odds ratio 4.65, P = 0.02; respectively). However, there was no such relationship for sex, age, class of antidepressant, combined use of benzodiazepines, or diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that major depressive disorder and a diagnosis of mood disorder in first-degree relatives may be clinical predictors of antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome.

539,Incidence and predictors of activation syndrome induced by antidepressants,"Background: Activation syndrome is a side effect of antidepressants that is thought to carry a potentially increased risk of suicide. However, the incidence of activation syndrome has not been fully investigated and little has been reported on its predictors. The aim of this study was to survey the incidence of activation syndrome and clarify its predictors in a natural clinical setting. Methods: Among 2,521 new outpatients visiting between August 2003 and March 2005, we retrospectively surveyed the case records of 729 patients who had not taken any antidepressants during the 1 month before presentation and were prescribed antidepressants for 3 months after the initial visit. Patients were classified as developing activation syndrome if they experienced any symptom of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania during the first 3 months. Results: Of the 729 patients, 31 (4.3%) developed activation syndrome. The incidence was not significantly related to gender, age, class of antidepressant, combined use of benzodiazepine, or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis except for personality disorder. Diagnosis of personality disorder was significantly associated with the induction of activation syndrome (odds ratio = 4.20, P = 0.002). Conclusions: This study suggests that diagnosis of personality disorder may be a clinical predictor of activation syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

540,Missed opportunity to screen and diagnose PTSD and depression among deploying shipboard US military personnel,"Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are significant risks for suicide and other adverse events among US military personnel, but prevalence data among ship-assigned personnel at the onset of deployment are unknown.Aims: To determine the prevalence of shipboard personnel who screen positive for PTSD and/or major depressive disorder (MDD) at the onset of deployment, and also those who reported these diagnoses made by a physician or healthcare professional in the year prior to deployment.Method: Active-duty ship-assigned personnel (N = 2078) completed anonymous assessments at the beginning of deployment. Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; score of ≥22), and PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C; both score and symptom criteria were used).Results: In total, 7.3% (n = 151 of 2076) screened positive for PTSD and 22% (n = 461 of 2078) for MDD at deployment onset. Only 6% and 15% of those who screened positive for PTSD or MDD, respectively, had been diagnosed by a healthcare professional in the past year.Conclusions: Missed opportunities for mental healthcare among screen-positive shipboard personnel reduce the benefits associated with early identification and linkage to care. Improved methods of mental health screening that promote early recognition and referral to care may mitigate psychiatric events in theatre.Declaration Of Interest: This work was performed as part of the official duties of the authors as military service members or employees of the US Government.Copyright and Usage: This work was prepared by military service members or employees of the US Government as part of their official duties","Harbertson J; Hale BR; Michael NL; Scott PT,",0,540
541,Insomnia and complicated grief symptoms in bereaved college students,"In this study, we extended previous research by concentrating on sleep- and grief-related symptoms in a cohort of bereaved college students, in view of the potential for each of these problems to exacerbate the other. A sample of 815 college students completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief (H. G. Prigerson & S. C. Jacobs, 2001), along with an assessment of diagnostic criteria for insomnia and associated sleep behaviors. As predicted, the rate of insomnia was significantly higher (22%) in the bereaved sample than in a nonbereaved comparison group (17%), a difference that was particularly pronounced in terms of middle insomnia. Also as hypothesized, bereaved insomniacs reported higher complicated grief scores than bereaved noninsomniacs, and several specific sleep variables (including sleep-onset insomnia related to nighttime rumination about the loss and sleep-maintenance insomnia associated with dreaming of the deceased) were significantly related to complicated grief symptomatology.;Bereavement*, Grief*, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*psychology, Students/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Cause of Death, Cohort Studies, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Dreams, Female, Homicide/psychology, Humans, Male, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Students/statistics & numerical data, Suicide/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires","Hardison, Heather Gaines; Neimeyer, Robert A & Lichstein, Kenneth L",0,541
542,Health issues in adolescents' Internet use - benefits and risks,"The Internet has turned during the past decade into a major information resource in various domains of life and a communication venue among adolescents who seek health information via the net. The increasing availability of computers in homes, as well as wireless Internet access, means that adolescents today can go online anywhere, at any time. The media are not the leading cause of any major health problem, but they do contribute significantly to a variety of adolescent health problems, including aggressive behavior, sexual activity, drug use, obesity, sleep disorders, eating disorders, depression, suicide and self harm. This paper focuses on 3 major health issues in adolescents' Internet use: Body image and eating behaviors; sexuality and reproductive health behaviors; and self harm and suicidal behavior. This paper also demonstrates Internet venues where reliable health information is provided to young people by health professionals. Health professionals need to recognize the hazards of adolescents Internet use, and to address potential Internet abuse when encountering adolescents in clinical settings.;Adolescent Development*, Information Seeking Behavior*, Internet*, Adolescent Behavior/*psychology, Patient Education as Topic/*methods, Risk Assessment/*methods, Sexuality/*psychology, Access to Information/psychology, Adolescent, Humans, Physician-Patient Relations","Hardoff, D",0,542
543,Psychiatric adverse events associated with varenicline: an intensive postmarketing prospective cohort study in New Zealand,"Background: Psychiatric adverse events, including depression, suicidal ideation and psychotic reactions have been reported in patients taking the smoking cessation medicine varenicline. However, data regarding the frequency of psychiatric adverse reactions in 'real-life' postmarketing use are limited to date.; Objective: The aim of the study was to calculate the occurrence rates of psychiatric adverse reactions in a nationwide general population prescribed varenicline in New Zealand.; Methods: Observational prospective cohort study using Prescription Event Monitoring methods. All New Zealand patients dispensed a prescription for varenicline from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 were included in this study. Patients were followed up by multiple methods, including linkage to national morbidity and mortality datasets, questionnaires to patients' doctors and assessment of spontaneous reports sent to the Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme. Main outcome measures were occurrence rates of psychiatric adverse events in the total patient cohort and in the subgroup for whom a follow-up questionnaire was returned (the 'responder population').; Results: The cohort for this study included 3415 patients prescribed varenicline during the first year of monitoring in New Zealand. Follow-up by record linkage was performed for 3353 (98%) patients, and questionnaires were returned for 1394 (42%) of these patients. Of 1394 questionnaires returned, 1310 were valid and defined as the 'responder' population. Sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep disturbance, dreams and nightmares, were the most frequently reported psychiatric events and were experienced by 56 (4.3%) patients in the responder population. Symptoms of depression were reported by 39 (2.98%) patients in the responder population (24 new-onset depression, 14 worsening of pre-existing depression and 1 report of impaired motivation). Withdrawal reactions after stopping varenicline were reported by 6 (0.46%) patients in the responder population. Serious psychiatric reactions including suicide (one case), suicidal ideation (two cases) and psychotic reactions (three cases) were also identified. Six self-harm events (one fatal, five non-fatal) were identified in the total cohort, giving an occurrence rate of 0.18% (95% CI 0.06, 0.38) in this population.; Conclusions: This intensive postmarketing study of 3415 New Zealand patients demonstrates that psychiatric adverse events are commonly reported in patients taking varenicline. Approximately 3% of patients experienced symptoms of depression and the majority of these cases appeared to have a causal association with varenicline. Serious psychiatric reactions including suicide, suicidal ideation and psychotic reactions were also identified, but these were less frequently reported.;Benzazepines/*adverse effects, Mental Disorders/*chemically induced, Nicotinic Agonists/*adverse effects, Quinoxalines/*adverse effects, Sleep Wake Disorders/*chemically induced, Smoking Cessation/*methods, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cohort Studies, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, New Zealand, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/statistics & numerical data, Prospective Studies, Surveys and Questionnaires, Varenicline, Young Adult","Harrison-Woolrych, Mira & Ashton, Janelle",0,543
544,Trajectories of self-reported sleep disturbance across inpatient psychiatric treatment predict clinical outcome in comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,"As there has been a demonstrated link between sleep disturbance and suicide, the present study investigated the relationship between self-reported sleep disturbance during inpatient psychiatric treatment and clinical outcomes at discharge and six months post-discharge.Methods: Participants were 2,970 adults receiving care in a long-term inpatient psychiatric hospital. Greater than 90% of inpatients reported at least mild sleep disturbance throughout treatment. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine patterns of sleep disturbance changes over time.Results: Participants fit into distinct categories based on their trajectories of sleep problems across treatment: No Sleep Problems (10.3% of participants, no sleep problems endorsed over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment), Resolvers (sleep problems completely resolved over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment; 10.6%), Non-Responders (did not respond to inpatient psychiatric treatment; 35.7%) and Responders (sleep problems decreased but did not fully resolve over the course of inpatient psychiatric treatment; 43.4%). Individuals with comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to demonstrate higher rates of sleep disturbance throughout inpatient psychiatric treatment and their sleep problems did not respond to treatment as usual (Non-Responders). Further, patients in the Non-Responder group had significantly more suicidal ideation and worse clinical outcomes (higher anxiety, more disability, and lower well-being) at discharge and six months post-discharge, as well as were on more medication including hypnotics throughout treatment.Conclusions: Findings indicate the urgent need to design and implement inpatient psychiatry sleep protocols to not only improve sleep and clinical outcomes, but also reduce the risk for suicide post-discharge",Hartwig EM; Rufino KA; Palmer CA; Shepard C; Alfano CA; Schanzer B; Mathew SJ; Patriquin MA,1,544
545,Sleep and circadian functioning: Critical mechanisms in the mood disorders?,"Evidence for the importance of sleep in the mood disorders has mushroomed over the past decade. Among adolescents and adults with a mood disorder, sleep disturbance is a risk factor for episodes, can contribute to relapse, has an adverse impact on emotion regulation, is critical for cognitive functioning, compromises health, and may contribute to substance use comorbidity and suicidality. This evidence has triggered a shift away from viewing sleep disturbance as an epiphenomenon, toward viewing sleep disturbance as an important but under-recognized mechanism in the multifactorial cause and maintenance of the mood disorders. Because the biology underpinning the sleep and circadian system is an open system, readily influenced by inputs from the environment, sleep in the mood disorders represents a unique and exciting domain for interdisciplinary research across behavioral, social, cognitive, and neurobiological levels of explanation. Together, the accumulated evidence has informed a range of novel, powerful, simple, and inexpensive treatments with potential for massive improvements to public health, including improving quality of life, reducing length and severity of episodes, and reducing the risk of subsequent episodes in the large number of individuals who suffer from mood disorders.

After reviewing the evidence that has accrued to date on the nature and severity of the sleep disturbance experienced, we document the importance of sleep for quality of life, risk for relapse, affective functioning, cognitive functioning, health (sleep disturbance is implicated in obesity, poor diet, and inadequate exercise), impulsivity, and risk taking. We argue that sleep may be critically important in the complex multifactorial cause of interepisode dysfunction, adverse health outcomes, and relapse. An agenda for future research is presented that includes improving the quality of sleep measures and controlling for the impact of bipolar medications.; ","Harvey, Allison G.; Talbot, Lisa S. & Gershon, Anda",0,546
547,"Old drug ifenprodil, new hope for PTSD with a history of childhood abuse","Comments on an article Sexual abuse and lifetime diagnosis of psychiatric disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis by L. P. Chen (2010). A recent meta-analysis showed that a history of sexual abuse is associated with increased risk for a lifetime diagnosis of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, sleep disorders, and suicide attempts. However, there are currently no standard therapeutic agents for treating flashbacks associated with PTSD. The NMDA receptors are crucial for synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, and glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptors plays a role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. In conclusion, we would like to propose that ifenprodil therapy could be an alternative treatment for flashbacks in adult and adolescent PTSD patients with a childhood abuse, since this drug is already in clinical use. Nonetheless, more detailed randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of ifenprodil are needed to confirm its efficacy.

548,"A 35-year-old man with depressed mood, insomnia, and suicidal ideation","The article presents a case report of a 35-year-old man with depressed mood, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. The patientâ€™s diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition was major depressive episode. Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with major depressive disorder fail to respond adequately to treatment and are labeled 'treatment resistant' (or treatment refractory), which is usually taken to mean failure to respond to two or more trials of antidepressant medication of adequate dose and duration. The goal of antidepressant treatment is remission of symptoms, which is usually taken to mean complete resolution of symptoms as signified by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 7 or less, as un-remitted patients report poorer quality of life and are at higher risk of relapse and recurrence. Current guidelines suggest a step-wise approach to patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although there are no straightforward algorithms or charts and treatment must be individually tailored, current options suggest four main strategies, which can be remembered with the mnemonic: 'SACO' (Switching, Augmentation, Combination, and Optimization).

Findings from clinical interviews for depression (derived from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and the Raskin Three Area Scale for Depression show rapid improvement in suicidal feelings, insomnia, and anorexia, but slower and more gradual improvement in impaired work and interests, retardation, and pessimism and hopelessness. Psychotic depressives did not show substantial improvement until the 3rd wk of treatment whereas neurotic depressives improved markedly within the 1st wk. It is suggested that the psychotic classification may be more useful as a predictor of speed of response than as a predictor of final treatment outcome.

550,Abnormal fingernail beds following carbon monoxide poisoning: a case report and review of the literature,"Introduction: Carbon monoxide poisoning is a very common cause of death in accidental, suicidal, or homicidal cases throughout the world. Fingernail bed manifestation is reported in survivors of carbon monoxide poisoning.; Case Presentation: A 40-year-old Caucasian woman was exposed to carbon monoxide when she was sleeping alone in her one-bedroom apartment; fortunately, the beeps from her First Alert combination smoke and carbon monoxide detector woke her and she was saved from any extensive health issues. The most indicative symptoms experienced were a severe headache, blurred vision, agitation, and confusion. Following contact with the Emergency Responses Services, she was promptly transferred to the hospital via ambulance and was treated with high-flow oxygen on the way. She was discharged from the emergency department on the same day, but carbon monoxide exposure had already had adverse effects on her fingernail beds. The fingernail tips were altered and appeared as if a bite had been taken out of their distal borders. The changes in the tips of her fingernails were significant, but they completely disappeared eight weeks later without any additional treatment.; Conclusions: Worldwide, carbon monoxide poisoning is a potentially lethal condition that is preventable with educational programs and installation of carbon monoxide detectors in the home setting. Exposure to carbon monoxide frequently goes unrecognized until it is too late and causes silent death. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of fingernail bed manifestations in a survivor of carbon monoxide poisoning.; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning/*therapy, Nails/*drug effects, Nails, Malformed/*chemically induced, Nails, Malformed/*therapy, Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/*methods, Adult, Emergency Medical Services/methods, Female, Humans, Treatment Outcome","Hatami, Mehrangiz; Naftolin, Frederick & Khatamee, Masood A.",0,550

Results show that 6.3% of Ss reported IPA during the previous year. Those experiencing IPA were more likely to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Ss experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance but did receive routine health care. Findings suggest that females in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for serious emotional and physical health concerns and that most are in routine contact with health care providers.

552,"Prevalence and Trends of Concurrent Opioid Analgesic and Benzodiazepine Use Among Veterans Affairs Patients with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, 2003-2011","Background: Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have complex and multiple symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, and co-occurring pain, often treated with opioids and benzodiazepines. While concurrent use of these medications poses safety concerns, little is known about the trends of long-term concurrent use and the prevalence of high-risk conditions among those who are prescribed them. Study objectives were to examine the trends in annual prevalence of long-term concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use among patients with PTSD and prevalence of high-risk conditions in concurrent users of these medications.; Design: Retrospective review of pharmacy records of the Veteran Affairs Northwest Integrated Network (VISN20).; Subjects: Patients (nâ€‰=â€‰66,210) with PTSD receiving care during 2003-2011.; Methods: Concurrent use was defined as overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions for â‰¥90 consecutive days. Gender-specific logistic regressions estimated long-term concurrent use of these medications and tested for linear trends over 9-years.; Results: The trend in age-adjusted long-term concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use over 9-years increased 52.7%, from 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 3.3-3.9%) to 5.5% (5.3-5.8%), in men and 79.5%, from 3.9% (3.0-5.0%) to 7.0% (6.2-7.9%), in women. In 2011, 17.1% of long-term concurrent users were prescribed morphine-equivalent daily doses of opioids â‰¥100 mg and 49.4% had a documented high-risk condition.; Conclusion: Despite known risks associated with prescribing opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently, the adjusted prevalence of long-term concurrent use rose significantly among men and women with PTSD in VISN20 over a 9-year period.

At present, the factors that predict college studentsâ€™ violent behavior are not well understood. To increase knowledge in this area, two studies were conducted that examined the prevalence and predictors of college studentsâ€™ fears of committing violent behavior. Data from a single university indicated that less than 2% of the general student body possessed strong fears of acting violently and more than 80% of students had no such fears. Among clients at the university counseling center, 7% expressed strong fears of acting violently whereas 71% of clients had no such fears. Similar prevalence rates were found in a sample of 27,616 clients from 66 university counseling centers. Predictors of fears of acting violently included low academic motivation, suicidal ideation, irritable feelings, fears of having a panic attack in public, having harmed another person previously, having nightmares or flashbacks, and getting into frequent arguments.

554,Anxiety and depression in adults with primary immunodeficiency: How much do these patients experience and how much do they attribute to their primary immunodeficiency?,"Introduction: Primary immunodeficiency (PID) is a rare group of disorders that manifest similarly with infection, neoplasms, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, and are treated with injectable medications. Often the burden of disease and cost of management is excessive, and premature death is not uncommon. In light of these features of PID, it was our objective to survey our cohort to assess for factors that can influence depression and anxiety.; Methods: We used an investigator-developed survey, in addition to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, after institutional review board approval of our pilot study, to determine the extent of anxiety and depression that our patients with PID experienced and variables that may have affected the difference of expression. The differences among groups were tested by using Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and chi-square tests.; Results: The patients with PID had similar depression compared with the U.S. population, as assessed by the HAM-D scale. Risk factors associated with elevated HAM-D scores included the following: not driving, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (versus subcutaneous), nurse-administered therapy (versus self-administered), having unpleasant adverse effects from therapy, previously attempted suicide, and family members with reported anxiety and/or depression. Anxiety was not significantly increased in our cohort. Risk factors for significantly elevated Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores included the following: having poor health, an unhealthy diet, lack of refreshing sleep, and family members with reported anxiety and/or depression.; Conclusion: Many factors influence depression and anxiety, and may add to the morbidity of PID. Patients should be assessed for our identified factors for depression and anxiety. Treatment or referrals should be initiated as it is hoped to improve our patients' quality of life and outcomes.; Anxiety*/diagnosis, Depression*/diagnosis, Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*epidemiology, Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*psychology, Adult, Female, Humans, Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/diagnosis, Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/therapy, Male, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires","Heath, Jacqueline; Lehman, Erik; Saunders, Erika F.

555,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based and mobile stress-management intervention for employees: design of a randomized controlled trial,"Work-related stress is associated with a variety of mental and emotional problems and can lead to substantial economic costs due to lost productivity, absenteeism or the inability to work. There is a considerable amount of evidence on the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face stress-management interventions for employees; however, they are often costly, time-consuming, and characterized by a high access threshold. Web-based interventions may overcome some of these problems yet the evidence in this field is scarce. This paper describes the protocol for a study that will examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based guided stress-management training which is based on problem solving and emotion regulation and aimed at reducing stress in adult employees.Methods: The study will target stressed employees aged 18 and older. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be applied. Based on a power calculation of d=.35 (1-β of 80%, α = .05), 264 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. Inclusion criteria include an elevated stress level (Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale-10 ≥ 22) and current employment. Exclusion criteria include risk of suicide or previously diagnosed psychosis or dissociative symptoms. The primary outcome will be perceived stress, and secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety. Data will be collected at baseline and seven weeks and six months after randomization. An extended follow up at 12 months is planned for the intervention group. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect health care costs. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.Discussion: The substantial negative consequences of work-related stress emphasize the necessity for effective stress-management trainings. If the proposed internet intervention proves to be (cost-) effective, a preventative, economical stress-management tool will be conceivable.

556,Effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy for depression in routine psychiatric care,"Background: Efficacy of guided Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for depression has been demonstrated in several randomised controlled trials. Knowledge on the effectiveness of the treatment, i.e. how it works when delivered within routine care, is however scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of ICBT for depression. Methods: We conducted a cohort study investigating all patients (N = 1203) who had received guided ICBT for depression between 2007 and 2013 in a routine care setting at an outpatient psychiatric clinic providing Internet-based treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self rated (MADRS-S). Results: Patients made large improvements from pre-treatment assessments to post-treatment on the primary outcome (effect size d on the MADRS-S = 1.27, 99% CI, 1.14-1.39). Participants were significantly improved in terms of suicidal ideation and sleep difficulties. Improvements were sustained at 6-month follow-up. Limitations: Attrition was rather large at 6-month follow-up. However, additional data was collected through telephone interviews with dropouts and advanced statistical models indicated that missing data did not bias the findings. Conclusions: ICBT for depression can be highly effective when delivered within the context of routine psychiatric care. This study suggests that the effect sizes are at least as high when the treatment is delivered in routine psychiatric care by qualified staff as when delivered in a controlled trial setting.

558,Bipolar patients referred to specialized services of care: Not resistant but impaired by sub-syndromal symptoms Results from the FACE-BD cohort,"Objective: A national network of expert centers for bipolar disorders was set up in France to provide support, mainly for psychiatrists, who need help for managing bipolar disorder patients. The aims of this article are to present the main characteristics of the patients referred to an expert center in order to highlight the major disturbances affecting these patients and to understand the most significant difficulties encountered by practitioners dealing with bipolar disorder patients. Methods: Patients were evaluated by trained psychiatrists and psychologists, with standardized and systematic assessment using interviews and self-report questionnaires. Results: All patients (n = 839) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria for bipolar disorder I (48.4%), bipolar disorder II (38.1%) or bipolar disorder-not otherwise specified (13.5%). Mean illness duration was 17 years (Â±11.3), with 41.9% of patients having a history of suicide attempts. Lifetime comorbidities were 43.8% for anxiety disorders and 32.8% for substance abuse. At the point of inclusion, most patients (76.2%) were not in an acute phase, being considered to have a syndromal remission, but which still required referral to a tertiary system of care. Among these patients, 37.5% had mild to moderate residual depressive symptoms (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale ranging from 7 to 19) despite 39% receiving an antidepressant. However, 47.8% were considered to be poorly adherent to medication; 55% showed evidence of sleep disturbances, with half being overweight; 68.1% of patients showed poor functioning (Functioning Assessment Short Test â‰¥ 12) with this being linked to residual depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances and increased body mass index. Conclusions: It appears that bipolar disorder patients referred to an expert center in most cases do not suffer from a severe or resistant illness but they rather have residual symptoms, including subtle but chronic perturbations that have a major impact on levels of functioning. The longitudinal follow-up of these patients will enable a better understanding of the evolution of such residual symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

559,A French network of bipolar expert centres: A model to close the gap between evidence-based medicine and routine practice,"Background: Bipolar disorders are a major public health concern. Efforts to provide optimal care by general practitioners and psychiatrists are undermined by the complexity of the disorder and difficulties in applying clinical practice guidelines and new research findings to the spectrum of cases seen in day to day practice. Method: A national network of bipolar expert centres was established. Each centre has established strong links to local health services and provides support to clinicians in delivering personalized care plans derived from systematic case assessments undertaken at the centre. Results: A common set of diagnostic and clinical assessment tools has been adopted at eight centres. Evaluations are undertaken by trained assessors and cross-centre reliability is monitored. A web application, e-bipolarÂ© is used to record data in a common computerized medical file. Anonymized data is entered into a shared national database for use in multi-centre audit and research. Conclusions: Instead of offering treatment advice based on clinical practice guidelines recommendations for selected sub-populations of patients (a â€˜top-downâ€™ approach), the French bipolar network offers systematic, comprehensive, longitudinal, and multi-dimensional assessments of cases representative of general bipolar populations. This â€˜bottom-upâ€™ strategy may offer a more efficient and effective way to transfer knowledge and share expertise as the referrer can appreciate the rationale underpinning suggested treatment protocols and more readily apply such principles and approaches to other cases. The network also builds an infrastructure for clinical cohort and comparative-effectiveness research on more representative patient populations.

560,Methods for assessing patient“clinician communication about depression in primary care: What you see depends on how you look,"Objective: To advance research on depression communication and treatment by comparing assessments of communication about depression from patient report, clinician report, and chart review to assessments from transcripts. Data: One hundred sixtyâ€four primary care visits from seven health care systems (2010â€“2011). Study Design: Presence or absence of discussion about depressive symptoms, treatment recommendations, and followâ€up was measured using patient and clinician post-visit questionnaires, chart review, and coding of audio transcripts. Sensitivity and specificity of indirect measures compared to transcripts were calculated. Principal Findings: Patient report was sensitive for mood (83 percent) and sleep (83 percent) but not suicide (55 percent). Patient report was specific for suicide (86 percent) but not for other symptoms (44â€“75 percent). Clinician report was sensitive for all symptoms (83â€“98 percent) and specific for sleep, memory, and suicide (80â€“87 percent), but not for other symptoms (45â€“48 percent). Chart review was not sensitive for symptoms (50â€“73 percent), but it was specific for sleep, memory, and suicide (88â€“96 percent). All indirect measures had low sensitivity for treatment recommendations (patient report: 24â€“42 percent, clinician report 38â€“50 percent, chart review 49â€“67 percent) but high specificity (89â€“96 percent). For definite followâ€up plans, all three indirect measures were sensitive (82â€“96 percent) but not specific (40â€“57 percent). Conclusions: Clinician report and chart review generally had the most favorable sensitivity and specificity for measuring discussion of depressive symptoms and treatment recommendations, respectively.

561,Suvorexant in elderly patients with insomnia: Pooled analyses of data from phase III randomized controlled clinical trials,"Objective: Suvorexant is an orexin receptor antagonist approved for treating insomnia at doses of 10â€“20 mg. Previously reported phase III results showed that suvorexant was effective and well-tolerated in a combined-age population (elderly and nonelderly adults). The present analysis evaluated the clinical profile of suvorexant specifically in the elderly. Methods: Prespecified subgroup analyses of pooled 3-month data from two (efficacy) and three (safety) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. In each trial, elderly (â‰¥65 years) patients with insomnia were randomized to suvorexant 30 mg, suvorexant 15 mg, and placebo. By design, fewer patients were randomized to 15 mg. Patient-reported and polysomnographic (subset of patients) sleep maintenance and onset endpoints were measured. Results: Suvorexant 30 mg (N = 319) was effective compared with placebo (N = 318) on patient-reported and polysomnographic sleep maintenance, and onset endpoints at Night 1 (polysomnographic endpoints)/Week 1 (patient-reported endpoints), Month 1, and Month 3. Suvorexant 15 mg (N = 202 treated) was also effective across these measures, although the onset effect was less evident at later time points. The percentages of patients discontinuing because of adverse events over 3 months were 6.4% for 30 mg (N = 627 treated), 3.5% for 15 mg (N = 202 treated), and 5.5% for placebo (N = 469 treated). Somnolence was the most common adverse event (8.8% for 30 mg, 5.4% for 15 mg, 3.2% for placebo). Conclusion: Suvorexant generally improved sleep maintenance and onset over 3 months of nightly treatment and was well-tolerated in elderly patients with insomnia (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01097616, NCT01097629, NCT01021813).

562,Causes and consequences of sleepiness among college students,"Daytime sleepiness, sleep deprivation, and irregular sleep schedules are highly prevalent among college students, as 50% report daytime sleepiness and 70% attain insufficient sleep. The consequences of sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness are especially problematic to college students and can result in lower grade point averages, increased risk of academic failure, compromised learning, impaired mood, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. This article reviews the current prevalence of sleepiness and sleep deprivation among college students, contributing factors for sleep deprivation, and the role of sleep in learning and memory. The impact of sleep and sleep disorders on academics, grade point average, driving, and mood will be examined. Most importantly, effective and viable interventions to decrease sleepiness and sleep deprivation through sleep education classes, online programs, encouragement of naps, and adjustment of class time will be reviewed. This paper highlights that addressing sleep issues, which are not often considered as a risk factor for depression and academic failure, should be encouraged. Promotion of university and college policies and class schedules that encourage healthy and adequate sleep could have a significant impact on the sleep, learning, and health of college students. Future research to investigate effective and feasible interventions, which disseminate both sleep knowledge and encouragement of healthy sleep habits to college students in a time and cost effective manner, is a priority.; GPA, academic performance, adolescence, grade point average, sleep deprivation, sleep education programs","Hershner, Shelley D. & Chervin, Ronald D.",0,562
563,Effects of different steps in gender reassignment therapy on psychopathology: A prospective study of persons with a gender identity disorder,"Abstract Introduction At the start of gender reassignment therapy, persons with a gender identity disorder (GID) may deal with various forms of psychopathology. Until now, a limited number of publications focus on the effect of the different phases of treatment on this comorbidity and other psychosocial factors. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate how gender reassignment therapy affects psychopathology and other psychosocial factors. Methods This is a prospective study that assessed 57 individuals with GID by using the Symptom Checklistâ€90 (SCLâ€90) at three different points of time: at presentation, after the start of hormonal treatment, and after sex reassignment surgery (SRS). Questionnaires on psychosocial variables were used to evaluate the evolution between the presentation and the postoperative period. The data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS 19.0, with significance levels set at P < 0.05. Main Outcome Measures The psychopathological parameters include overall psychoneurotic distress, anxiety, agoraphobia, depression, somatization, paranoid ideation/psychoticism, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and sleeping problems. The psychosocial parameters consist of relationship, living situation, employment, sexual contacts, social contacts, substance abuse, and suicide attempt. Results A difference in SCLâ€90 overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P < 0.001). Significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility. Furthermore, the SCLâ€90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated. Analysis of the psychosocial variables showed no significant differences between preâ€ and postoperative assessments. Conclusions A marked reduction in psychopathology occurs during the process of sex reassignment therapy, especially after the initiation of hormone therapy.

564,"Behavioral risk, emotional risk, and child abuse among adolescents in a nonclinical setting","In this replication study of adolescents in a nonclinical setting, the prevalence of reported problem behaviors, emotions, and abuse is evaluated, and the impact of abuse on multivariate emotional and behavioral risk is assessed. A total of 3998 students (69%) in a rural midwestern community in grades 7 to 12 participated in the study. Almost 20% of the students reported some form of physical and/or sexual abuse, with more girls than boys reporting sexual abuse (chi 2 = 48.5, P less than .001). Some problem behaviors (alcohol use) and emotions (trouble sleeping, difficulty with anger) were common among all adolescents and some were strongly associated with a history of abuse (especially, considering or attempting suicide, running away, laxative use, and vomiting to lose weight). Higher emotional and behavioral risk scores among abused students were confirmed. The effects of physical and sexual abuse on risk scores were independent and additive; no interaction was observed. An interaction of gender and sexual abuse on problem behavior was observed, with problem behavior being significantly greater among sexually abused boys. The results confirm increased risk of problem behaviors and negative feelings among abused adolescents when compared with nonabused peers, and better define influences of gender and abuse type on emotional and behavioral risks.; Adolescent Behavior*, Psychology, Adolescent*, Child Abuse/*psychology, Child Abuse, Sexual/*psychology, Adolescent, Female, Humans, Male","Hibbard, R.

565,An approach to managing depression in general practice,"Detection of depression in primary care can be enhanced by use of self-report assessment forms. With the new classes of antidepressants, there is the opportunity to choose specific drug classes for different types of depressive disorders. Depression is frequently a relapsing illness. Treatment goals should include long term reduction of vulnerability factors. An active therapeutic partnership can be facilitated by providing accurate detailed information early in the course of the illness. Behavioural therapies, which focus on modification of the sleep-wake cycle, activity planning and reduction of substance abuse, are essential. Structured problem solving is the most accessible form of cognitive intervention that general practitioners can readily provide. More complex cognitive therapies are usually provided by mental health professionals or general practitioners with extensive training.;Depressive Disorder*/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder*/drug therapy, Depressive Disorder*/rehabilitation, Family Practice*, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Behavior Therapy, Humans, Male, Problem Solving, Risk Assessment, Suicide/prevention & control","Hickie, I B",0,565
566,Association between psychotic experiences and non-accidental self-injury: Results from a nationally representative survey of adolescents,"Purpose: The association between psychotic experiences (PEs) and non-accidental self-injury (SI; including self-harm and suicide attempts) is well established, although variables influencing this relationship have not been comprehensively examined. This study aimed to investigate (1) the cross-sectional PEâ€“SI association before and after adjustment for confounders, and (2) the individual contribution of each confounding and potentially mediating variable to the association.Methods: A random sample of Australian adolescents aged 14â€“17 years (n = 1998) completed self-report questions regarding any self-harm, suicidality or PEs experienced in the past 12 months in 2013â€“2014 as part of the Young Minds Matter Survey, a national household survey. We conducted logistic regression analyses to investigate the association between SI and PEs, after controlling for confounders (sociodemographics, substance use, and parental mental illness) as well as the influence of potential mediators (major depression, bullying, psychological distress, sleep, self-esteem, disordered eating behaviour, social isolation, and intervention factors).Results: Except for special messages, all PE subtypes (auditory and visual hallucinatory experiences [HEs], and two of the three delusional experiences [DEs]) were associated with SI after adjustment for confounders (OR range: 2.60â€“5.21). Depression and psychological distress significantly influenced all PEâ€“SI associations, where depression appeared to fully explain the DEâ€“SI association, and partially attenuate the HEâ€“SI association. Variables such as parental mental illness, disordered eating behaviour, and social isolation had negligible effects in nearly all self-harm and attempted suicide models.Conclusions: Adolescents reporting any PE in the past 12 months reported increased likelihood of SI in the same time period and, auditory HEs in particular, were strongly and independently associated with self-harm and suicide attempts. These results highlight the importance of PEs as indicators of risk of self-injurious behaviour among Australian youth.

567,"Risks of cardiovascular or central nervous system adverse events and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, for dolutegravir versus other antiretrovirals: meta-analysis of randomized trials","Purpose Of Review: Results from nonrandomized cohort studies suggest higher risks of CNS adverse events for dolutegravir, versus other ARVs. There have been two case reports of myocarditis on dolutegravir. Integrase inhibitors have been associated with IRIS in two cohort studies. Meta-analysis of randomized trials can be used to cross-check potential safety signals. This systematic review of drug safety used an EMBASE and MEDLINE search combined with serious adverse event (SAE) reports on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Cardiovascular, CNS or IRIS-associated adverse events were analysed for dolutegravir versus other ARVs. Relative risks for the comparison between dolutegravir and other antiretrovirals were calculated for each adverse event. Meta-analyses applied Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models.; Recent Findings: There was a higher risk of Grade 1-4 insomnia adverse events for DTG (6.1%) versus other ARVs (4.5%; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.02). There was no significant difference between DTG and other ARVs in the risk of cardiovascular serious adverse events. In the SINGLE and SPRING-1 trials comparing DTG with efavirenz, there were 5/465 patients with reported suicidality SAEs on DTG (1.1%) versus 6/469 (1.3%) on EFV. In other studies, serious adverse events of suicidality were reported for 15/2250 patients on DTG (0.7%) versus 9/2257 patients on other ARVs (0.4%). Risks of IRIS were low, but event rates were low and the main trials excluded CDC stage C disease.; Summary: In this meta-analysis, there was no significant effect of dolutegravir on the risk of cardiac, IRIS or suicide-related serious adverse events. There was a higher risk of insomnia for DTG. Other completed randomized trials should be included in new evaluations of DTG safety. Continued pharmacovigilance, with regular meta-analyses, should be used to monitor safety.; ","Hill, Andrew M.; Mitchell, Nikkita; Hughes, Sophie & Pozniak, Anton L.",0,567

569,Binge drinking above and below twice the adolescent thresholds and healthrisk behaviors,"Background: Underage drinking has been associated with healthâ€risk behaviors: unintentional and unprotected sex; physical and sexual assault; suicide; homicide; traffic and other unintentional injuries; and overdoses. Five drinks consumed over 2 hours by adult males and 4 drinks by adult females typically produce blood alcohol levels (BALs) of â‰¥ 0.08%, which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism considers binge drinking. Being smaller, young adolescents can reach adult bingeâ€drinking BALs of â‰¥ 0.08% with fewer drinks. Previous research indicates boys ages 9 to 13 would reach â‰¥ 0.08% with 3 drinks, 4 drinks at ages 14 to 15, and 5 drinks at ages â‰¥ 16. For girls, â‰¥ 0.08% is reached with â‰¥ 3 drinks at ages 9 to 17 and â‰¥4 drinks at ages â‰¥ 18. This study explores whether, among a national sample of high school students, adolescent binge drinking at â‰¥ twice versus < twice the ageâ€/genderâ€specific thresholds versus nonbinge drinking heightens associations of drinking with healthâ€risk behaviors. Methods: In 2015, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked a national probability sample of 15,624 high school students grades 9 to 12 (response rate 60%) about their pastâ€month drinking and pastâ€month or pastâ€year healthâ€risk behaviors. Logistic regressions with pairwise comparisons examined the association between different drinking levels and selected risk behaviors, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and drinking frequency. Results: Seven percent binged â‰¥ twice and 9% < twice the ageâ€/genderâ€specific thresholds, and 14% drank less than the binge thresholds. Significantly higher percentages of binge drinkers at â‰¥ twice versus < twice the thresholds versus other drinkers reported illegal drug and tobacco use, risky sexual and traffic behaviors, physical fights, suicide, less schoolâ€night sleep, and poorer school grades. Conclusions: Adolescent alcohol misuse screening should query the maximum number of drinks consumed per occasion and frequency of such consumption. State and national surveillance surveys should include those questions to investigate which individual, family, school, community, and policy interventions reduce consumption beyond binge thresholds and related healthâ€risk behaviors.

571,Time Course of Depression-Symptom Improvement During Treatment with Duloxetine,"The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal response for overall and individual symptoms during the treatment of major depressive disorder. Data were pooled from two 9-week trials, which compared duloxetine 60-mg QD (n = 251) with placebo (n = 261) in the treatment of MDD. Changes from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMDâ‚â‚‡) and in the Visual Analog Scales for pain were analyzed. Compared to placebo-treated patients, duloxetine-treated-patients experienced greater improvement (P <. 05) in the HAMDâ‚â‚‡ total score at Week 2. The individual symptoms showing the most rapid improvements (Week 1) were depressed mood, guilt, suicidal ideation, work/activities, and psychic anxiety as well as VAS back pain and shoulder pain. At subsequent visits, significant improvements were observed in retardation (Week 2); hypochondriasis (Week 3); general somatic symptoms (Week 5); middle and late insomnia (Week 7); and gastrointestinal (GJ) symptoms, genital symptoms (level of sexual interest or ease of sexual arousal), insight, and early insomnia (Week 9). Significant advantages for duloxetine were not achieved at any visit for agitation, somatic anxiety, or weight loss. At Weeks 1 and 2, placebo-treated patients had significantly lower GI symptoms and reported less weight loss compared with duloxetine-treated patients; however, differences were not significant at subsequent visits. Furthermore, duloxetine was superior to placebo on GI symptoms at endpoint compared to placebo-treated patients; duloxetine-treated patients had a significantly higher response rate at Week 2 and a higher remission rate at Week 5. These results may help clinicians establish more accurate expectations regarding treatment with duloxetine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

572,Perceived stress moderates the effects of a randomized trial of dance movement therapy on diurnal cortisol slopes in breast cancer patients,"Women with breast cancer are at risk of psychosocial distress and may suffer from aberrant diurnal cortisol rhythms. Dance movement therapy (DMT), a movement-based psychotherapy that incorporates exercise and artistic components, has demonstrated stress reduction effects. This study examined the effects of DMT on the diurnal cortisol rhythms of breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment and the role of perceived stress in producing such effects. The study sample comprised 121 Chinese breast cancer patients randomized to the DMT (n=63) and control (n=58) groups. The intervention consisted of six 1.5-h group sessions held twice weekly over the course of radiotherapy. Participants completed validated self-report measures of perceived stress, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance and provided five salivary cortisol samples at baseline (Time 1) and post-intervention (Time 2). Moderated mediation analysis was used to evaluate the intervention effect on Time 2 diurnal cortisol slopes. Despite the absence of a significant DMT effect on diurnal cortisol slopes (B=-0.55, 95% CI=-1.20 to 0.08, Î²=-0.14), baseline perceived stress significantly moderated the intervention effect (B=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.32 to -0.05, Î²=-0.30). At high levels of baseline perceived stress (1 SD above the mean), the DMT group showed a steeper cortisol slope (M=-7.14) than the control group (M=-5.80) at Time 2. The present findings suggest that DMT might have a beneficial effect on diurnal cortisol slopes in breast cancer patients with high levels of distress.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

573,The associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health among adolescents: a systematic review,"Background: With technological developments and modernised sedentary lifestyles has come an increase in diseases associated with inactivity such as obesity and other non-communicable diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that time spent sedentary may also interact with mental health. This systematic review examined the associations between sedentary behaviour and mental health problems among adolescents.; Methods: This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, and applied a quality assessment tool for quantitative studies to identity best available evidence. Following stringent search strategy of the databases; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Health Source: Nursing and Academic Edition, MEDLINE, PsychARTICLES and PsycINFO, we identified 32 articles eligible for review.; Results: All studies reported leisure screen time among adolescents, and two thirds of identified studies examined depressive symptomatology. Other mental health measures were; anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, suicide ideation, loneliness, stress, and psychological distress. Strong consistent evidence was found for the relationship between both depressive symptomatology and psychological distress, and time spent using screens for leisure. Moderate evidence supported the relationship between low self-esteem and screen use. Poorer mental health status was found among adolescents using screen time more than 2-3Â h per day, and gender differences exist. Essential information was missing for quality of evidence including heterogeneity in mental health and screen time-based measures, and self-report data collection methods.; Conclusions: The findings are of particular significance given the global public health concern of lifestyle-attributed diseases and the possibility for novel approaches to mental health. Future research should examine the psychological impact of reducing time spent using screens for leisure among adolescents, whilst accounting for possible confounding factors such as physical activity and dietary behaviours. It is critical that the reciprocal relationship between lifestyle behaviours and mental health is represented in both the psychiatric and public health forum.; Computers*, Internet*, Leisure Activities*, Mental Health*, Sedentary Lifestyle*, Television*, Video Games*, Adolescent, Depression/etiology, Exercise, Female, Humans, Male, Self Concept, Stress, Psychological/etiology, Adolescents*, Mental health*, Screen time*, Sedentary behaviour*","Hoare, Erin; Milton, Karen; Foster, Charlie & Allender, Steven",0,573
574,Exploring thematic nightmare content and associated selfharm risk,"Nightmares have been shown to be robust predictors of selfâ€harm risk, beyond depressive symptoms and hopelessness at times. However, few studies have investigated associations between nightmare content and increased selfâ€harm risk. This study explored associations of thematic nightmare content with history of selfâ€harm, and risk of selfâ€harm phenomena the morning following a nightmare. A mixedâ€method diary study was performed. Prospective nightmare reports were obtained from 72 participants. A total of 47 nightmare reports met inclusion criteria and were analyzed for themes using inductive thematic analysis. Chiâ€square and bootstrap Pearson's correlation tests were performed to assess the associations between nightmare themes and selfâ€harm history, and risk of selfâ€harm phenomena following a nightmare. 'Powerlessness to Change Behavior' was associated with a history of selfâ€harm engagement, whereas 'Financial Hardship' indicated reduced risk. Themes were not significantly associated with increased risk of selfâ€harm phenomena following a nightmare. Content may be of use in detecting lifetime history of selfâ€harm engagement, particularly in populations where disclosure is seen as taboo. However, nightmare symptom severity remains a better indicator of risk. Evidence for the utility of nightmare content in assessing immediate selfâ€harm risk is presently lacking.

Findings from our eâ€survey (n = 540) supported the IPTS over models of Suicide as Escape. Sleepâ€specific measurements of arousal (insomnia and nightmares) showed no main effect, yet interacted with acquired capability to predict increased suicidality. The explained variance in suicidality by the interaction (1%â€“2%) using sleepâ€specific measures was comparable to variance explained by interactions previously reported in the literature using measurements composed of a mix of waking and sleep state arousal symptoms. Similarly, when entrapment (inability to escape) was included in models, main effects of sleep symptoms arousal were not detected yet interacted with entrapment to predict suicidality. We discuss findings in relation to treatment options suggesting that sleepâ€specific interventions be considered for the longâ€term management of atâ€risk individuals.

577,The unidirectional relationship of nightmares on self-harmful thoughts and behaviors,"Understanding the direction of the predictive relationship between nightmares and suicidal behaviors is important to model its underlying mechanisms. We examine the direction of this relationship and the mediating role of negative affect. A fixed interval diary study obtained presleep and postsleep measures of affect, nightmares, and self-harmful thoughts and behaviors (SHTBs) from 72 university students (88.9% female). The results show predictive utility of nightmares on SHTBs--indicating a fourfold increased risk of SHTBs. Additionally, results support the suggestion of a unidirectional predictive influence (of nightmares on likelihood of SHTBs but not vice versa). Moreover, postsleep negative affect partially mediated the relationship between nightmares and postsleep SHTBs. This empirically validates assumptions of directionality for future models.

578,A randomized controlled trial of exercise to improve mood after traumatic brain injury,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that a structured aerobic exercise regimen would decrease the severity of depressive symptoms in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who reported at least mild depression severity at baseline.; Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.; Setting: Community gymnasium.; Participants: Subjects with a history of a prior TBI (6 months to 5 years post-injury), recruited from the community. Inclusion criteria included scoring â‰¥ 5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Subjects were excluded if they were non-English speakers, had a medical condition precluding exercise, had suicidal ideation, regularly exercised, or could not use standard aerobic exercise equipment.; Intervention: Weekly supervised exercise sessions over a 10-week period consisted of education, warm-up, 30 minutes of aerobic exercise, and cool down. The exercise intensity was adjusted to reach a heart rate goal of 60% of the participant's estimated maximal heart rate.; Main Outcome Measurement: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) comparing exercise to control groups. Post hoc analyses compared groups exercising â‰¥ 90 minutes or <90 minutes per week.; Results: Between-group comparisons at 10 weeks revealed no difference between groups on the BDI (P = .250). For the groups divided by minutes exercised per week, the high-activity group had significantly better depression scores than those in the low-activity group (P = .033).; Conclusions: Although there was no statistically significant difference between the treated and the control group on mood after intervention, those persons with TBI who recounted higher levels of exercise per week also reported less depression and improved sleep, community participation, and overall quality of life.; Copyright Â© 2010 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

579,Target problem (mis) matching: Predictors and consequences of parent“youth agreement in a sample of anxious youth,"Parents and youth often report discrepant target problems upon seeking treatment for youth psychopathology, which can have important impact on therapy processes (e.g., dropout) and treatment outcomes, as entry-level attitudes have been found to be influential in ultimate use and benefit of treatment. The current study examined parentâ€“youth agreement within an anxiety disordered sample by assessing demographic and diagnostic factors that may predict matching, as well as the impact of matching on attrition, treatment outcome, and parental satisfaction. Ninety-five youth with principal anxiety disorders received cognitiveâ€“behavioral treatment for anxiety at a university outpatient clinic. Youth and parents independently identified target problems during the pretreatment assessment. Target problems were coded into 25 qualitative categories representing diagnostic, symptom, and functional impairment domains, including diffuse anxiety, social anxiety, academic achievement, oppositional/behavior problems, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, and family functioning. The majority of parentâ€“youth dyads (67.4%) agreed on at least one target problem. Although problems related to diffuse anxiety and social anxiety were reported most frequently, relatively low rates of agreement were found in these domains. Kappa values demonstrated higher levels of agreement for problems with specific fears, school attendance, and panic and lower levels of agreement for difficulties with worry, shame, and self-esteem. Further, youth diagnosed with comorbid externalizing disorders were less likely to agree with their parents on at least one target problem. No effects were found for gender, age, or number of diagnoses in predicting agreement. Target problem agreement did not significantly impact rates of attrition or diagnostic remission, but did predict some measures of parental satisfaction. Results suggest that disagreement on treatment goals exists even within a narrow treatment population and may predict important consumer variables such as satisfaction. Findings emphasize that initial goals disagreement warrants careful assessment and monitoring.

580,Internet-based grief therapy for bereaved individuals after loss due to Haematological cancer: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Approximately 10% of the individuals experiencing the death of a loved one develop prolonged grief disorder (PGD) after bereavement. Family members of haematological cancer patients might be particularly burdened since their loss experience is preceded by a very strenuous time of disease and aggressive treatment. However, support needs of relatives of cancer patients often remain unmet, also after the death of the patient. Therapeutic possibilities are enhanced by providing easily available and accessible Internet-based therapies. This study will adapt and evaluate an Internet-based grief therapy for bereaved individuals after the loss of a significant other due to haematological cancer. Methods: The efficacy of the Internet-based grief therapy is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control group. Inclusion criteria are bereavement due to hematological cancer and meeting the diagnostic criteria for PGD. Exclusion criteria are severe depression, suicidality, dissociative tendency, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, and current psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment. The main outcome is PGD severity. Secondary outcomes are depression, anxiety, somatization, posttraumatic stress, quality of life, sleep quality, and posttraumatic growth. Data is collected pre- and posttreatment. Follow-up assessments will be conducted 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of the intervention. The Internet-based grief therapy is assumed to have at least moderate effects regarding PGD and other bereavement-related mental health outcomes. Predictors and moderators of the treatment outcome and PGD will be determined. Discussion: Individuals bereaved due to haematological cancer are at high risk for psychological distress. Tailored treatment for this particularly burdened target group is missing. Our study results will contribute to a closing of this healthcare gap.

581,Psychological Symptoms in Late Adolescence and Long-Term Risk of Suicide and Suicide Attempt,"Mental disorders in the general population are associated with increased risk of suicidality, but less is known about the independent predictive ability of self-reported psychological symptoms. We followed 49,321 screened and interviewed Swedish conscripts through 36-year follow-up to test whether psychological symptoms predicted suicide and hospitalization for suicide attempts. There were 619 suicides and 1,230 suicide attempts during the follow-up period. After excluding subjects with any psychiatric diagnoses (nÂ =Â 5,691, 12%) and controlling for other psychological symptoms, severe symptoms of anger, trouble falling asleep, and feeling down predicted suicide.

582,"Rumination in relation to suicide risk, ideation, and attempts: Exacerbation by poor sleep quality?","Background: Rumination, particularly brooding rumination, is associated with suicide risk, ideation and attempts; however, findings are inconsistent with respect to reflective rumination. Recent research suggests reflective rumination might be associated with increased suicide risk specifically among vulnerable individuals. Poor sleep quality is related to both suicide risk and rumination, yet no research has examined whether reflective rumination and sleep quality interact in relation to suicidal risk. This study, therefore, examined whether sleep quality moderates the link between ruminative subtypes and (a) suicide risk overall, and (b) suicidal ideation and (c) history of suicide attempts, specifically.; Methods: Participants were 1696 college students (ages 18-29 years; 65% female) who completed measures assessing rumination, sleep, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Hierarchical linear and logistic regressions were performed regressing overall suicide risk (linear), suicidal ideation (linear) and history of attempts (logistic) on ruminative subtypes controlling for demographics. Sleep quality was examined as a moderator of the rumination-suicide risk/ideation/attempts link.; Results: Brooding rumination was significantly associated with increased suicide risk, ideation, and attempts but these associations were not moderated by sleep quality. Sleep quality exacerbated the association of reflective rumination with overall suicide risk and suicidal ideation specifically. Reflective rumination was not itself, or in interaction with sleep quality, significantly associated with a history of suicide attempts.; Limitations: The study is cross-sectional and utilizes a college student sample.; Conclusions: This study adds to the literature that suggests reflective rumination is associated with suicide risk and ideation in certain cases, such as in individuals with lower sleep quality. In addition, the study adds continued support for an association between brooding rumination and suicidal behaviors. More studies that examine the relations between ruminative subtypes and attempts are needed.

583,A preliminary examination of the effect of cognitive processing therapy on sleep disturbance among veterans with military sexual trauma-related posttraumatic stress disorder,"Veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST) report numerous psychosocial difficulties including sleep disturbance and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) has been shown to effectively reduce total PTSD symptoms among veterans with MST-related PTSD; however, sleep disturbance may persist after successful treatment. Sleep disturbance is associated with suicidal self-directed violence, substance use, and poorer physical health. Identification of if and when CPT can sufficiently address sleep disturbance may help to determine when adjunctive interventions may be indicated. The current study described the rate of sleep disturbance in a sample of veterans with MST-related PTSD before and after CPT. In an exploratory analysis, potential baseline predictors (i.e., sociodemographic, PTSD symptoms, trauma-related cognitions, depression, and physical health) of change in sleep disturbance following CPT were assessed. A secondary analysis of 72 male and female veterans enrolled in a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of CPT for MST-related PTSD was conducted. Most veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance at baseline (100%) and posttreatment (89%). A significant relationship between clinically significant change in PTSD symptoms and resolution of sleep disturbance was not identified. Using hierarchical multiple linear regression, potential predictors of change in sleep severity following CPT were assessed; however, no significant predictors were identified in this exploratory analysis. These results are consistent with previous research describing high residual rates of sleep disturbance in veterans with PTSD, despite reductions in overall PTSD symptoms. Future research should focus on identifying effective augmentation strategies for CPT to specifically address sleep disturbance","Holder, Nicholas; Holliday, Ryan; Wiblin, Jessica; Surís, Alina",0,583
584,Sleep in depression and sleep deprivation: a brief conceptual review,"Risk factors for somnipathies are psychological stress or psychiatric illness. More severe sleep difficulties have been found to be clearly related to psychiatric illness such as depression and phobias, as well as to addiction. Somnipathies can objectively be identified by means of polygraphy. Overall, polysomnographic measures in patients with affective disorders differ most frequently and significantly from those in normal control subjects. Persistent sleep disturbances are associated with significant risk of both relapse and recurrence in mood disorders and an increased risk of suicide. In addition to changes in sleep architecture, patients with major depression show profoundly altered patterns of nocturnal hormone secretion, possibly through mechanisms that link regulation of sleep with neuroendocrine activity.

585,"Adolescent depression: Study protocol for a randomized, controlled, double-blind multicenter parallel group trial of Bright Light Therapy in a naturalistic inpatient setting (DeLight)","Background: Depressive disorders are among the most prominent health problems in youth. Even with the best available pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, remission rates are low. Without early treatment, depression in youth is associated with a high risk of symptom progression, chronicity, co-morbidity, and suicidal behavior. Thus, adolescent depression is a prime candidate for innovation in treatment. In depressive adults, meta-analytic evidence has proven that bright light therapy (BLT) is a potent low-threshold intervention, promising due to easy application, low side effects, and optimized compliance. In adolescents, studies with small samples show promising effects. This randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of BLT in youth inpatients.; Methods/design: In this randomized, controlled, double-blind multicenter parallel group trial, morning BLT is applied for fourÂ weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) for depressed youth inpatients (daily morning exposure to bright light via light-emitting glasses, 10,000Â lx, for 30Â min) and will be compared to a control condition (placebo light treatment, red light, identical light glasses). The primary objective is to assess whether BLT reduces symptoms of depression in youth with greater effect compared to placebo light therapy. Secondary objectives are to examine the impact of BLT on responder status, application of antidepressant medication, and further depression-related symptoms (sleep, activity, quality of life, satisfaction with health, general psychopathology, alertness, and circadian function). Nâ€‰=â€‰224 patients will be recruited in a naturalistic inpatient setting.

586,Thwarted belongingness as an explanatory link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation: Findings from three samples of military service members and veterans,"Background: Although insomnia has been identified as a robust predictor of suicidal ideation and behaviors, little is known about the mechanisms by which sleep disturbances confer risk for suicide. We investigated thwarted belongingness as an explanatory link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation across three military service member and veteran samples. Methods: Data were collected among United States military service members and veterans (Nâ‚ = 937, Nâ‚‚ = 3,386, Nâ‚ƒ = 417) who completed self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, thwarted belongingness, suicidal ideation, and related psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, hopelessness). Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation analyses were utilized to examine the indirect effects of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation through thwarted belongingness, controlling for related psychiatric symptoms. Results: Consistent with study hypotheses, thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation across all three samples; however, insomnia symptoms did not significantly account for the relationship between thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation, highlighting the specificity of our findings. Limitations: This study utilized cross-sectional self-report data. Conclusions: Insomnia may confer suicide risk for military service members and veterans, in part, through the pathway of thwarted belongingness. Additional prospective studies are warranted to further delineate this model of risk. Our results offer a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of suicide, via the promotion of belongingness, among service members and veterans experiencing insomnia symptoms.

587,Examining the link between prior suicidality and subsequent suicidal ideation among high-risk US military service members,"Background: Research is needed to identify the factors that explain the link between prior and future suicidality. This study evaluated possible mediators of the relationship between: (1) the severity of prior suicidality and (2) suicidal ideation severity at 3-month follow-up among a sample of high-risk military personnel.; Methods: US military service members referred to or seeking care for suicide risk (N = 624) completed self-report psychiatric domain measures and a clinician interview assessing prior suicidality severity at baseline. Three months later, participants completed a self-report measure of suicidal ideation severity. Three separate percentile bootstrap mediation models were used to examine psychiatric factors (i.e. alcohol abuse, anxiety sensitivity, hopelessness, insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, suicidal ideation, and thwarted belongingness) as parallel mediators of the relationship between prior suicidality severity (specifically, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and overall suicidality - i.e. ideation/attempt severity combined) at baseline and suicidal ideation severity at follow-up.; Results: Hopelessness, specifically, and the total effect of all mediators, each significantly accounted for the relationship between prior suicidality severity and subsequent ideation severity across models. In the models with attempt severity and overall suicidality severity as predictors, thwarted belongingness was also a significant mediator.; Conclusions: Hopelessness, thwarted belongingness, and overall severity of psychiatric indices may explain the relationship between prior suicidality severity and future suicidal ideation severity among service members at elevated suicide risk.

588,Investigating insomnia as a cross-sectional and longitudinal predictor of loneliness: Findings from six samples,"Loneliness has been repeatedly associated with sleep problems; however, there is a dearth of research examining the prospective relationship between insomnia and loneliness, as well as this association controlling for other psychiatric symptoms. This study evaluated the cross-sectional and prospective relationship between insomnia and loneliness using six samples: 666 undergraduates; 2785 Army recruiters; 208 adults with a history of suicidality and/or depression; 343 adult psychiatric outpatients; 326 young adults at elevated suicide risk; and 183 undergraduates. A meta-analysis also was conducted to examine the magnitude of the relationship between insomnia and loneliness across the six studies. More severe insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with greater feelings of loneliness while accounting for some (e.g., anxiety, nightmares) but not all (i.e., depression) psychiatric covariates. Findings underscore the strength of the association between insomnia and loneliness and suggest that depression may account for this relationship. Additional studies are needed to further establish the temporal relationship between these variables, delineate the role of depression in the association between insomnia and loneliness, and test whether insomnia may confer unique risk for subsequent loneliness.

589,"Insomnia brings soldiers into mental health treatment, predicts treatment engagement, and outperforms other suicide-related symptoms as a predictor of major depressive episodes","Given the high rates of suicide among military personnel and the need to characterize suicide risk factors associated with mental health service use, this study aimed to identify suicide-relevant factors that predict: (1) treatment engagement and treatment adherence, and (2) suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and major depressive episodes in a military sample. Army recruiters (N = 2596) completed a battery of self-report measures upon study enrollment. Eighteen months later, information regarding suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, major depressive episodes, and mental health visits were obtained from participantsâ€™ military medical records. Suicide attempts and suicidal ideation were very rare in this sample; negative binomial regression analyses with robust estimation were used to assess correlates and predictors of mental health treatment visits and major depressive episodes. More severe insomnia and agitation were significantly associated with mental health visits at baseline and over the 18-month study period. In contrast, suicide-specific hopelessness was significantly associated with fewer mental health visits. Insomnia severity was the only significant predictor of major depressive episodes. Findings suggest that assessment of sleep problems might be useful in identifying at-risk military service members who may engage in mental health treatment. Additional research is warranted to examine the predictive validity of these suicide-related symptom measures in a more representative, higher suicide risk military sample.

590,Examining physical and sexual abuse histories as correlates of suicide risk among firefighters,"Research indicates that physical and sexual abuse are associated with increased suicide risk; however, these associations have not been investigated among firefightersâ€”an occupational group that has been shown to be at elevated suicide risk. This study examined whether physical and sexual abuse histories are associated with (a) career suicide ideation, plans, and attempts; and (b) current suicide risk (controlling for theoretically relevant symptoms) in this occupational group. A sample of 929 U.S. firefighters completed selfâ€report surveys that assessed lifetime history of physical and sexual abuse; career suicide ideation, plans, and attempts; current suicide risk; and theoretically relevant symptoms. Logistic regression analyses revealed that individuals who reported a history of physical abuse were significantly more likely to report career suicide ideation, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.12, plans, AOR = 13.05, and attempts, AOR = 23.81, than those who did not. A similar pattern of findings emerged for individuals who reported a sexual abuse history, AORs = 7.83, 18.35, and 29.58 respectively. Linear regression analyses revealed that physical and sexual abuse histories each significantly predicted current suicide risk, even after controlling for theoretically relevant symptoms and demographics, prÂ² = .07 and .06, respectively. Firefighters with a history of physical and/or sexual abuse may be at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. A history of physical and sexual abuse were each significantly correlated with current suicide risk in this population, even after accounting for the effects of theoretically relevant symptoms. Thus, when conceptualizing suicide risk among firefighters, factors not necessarily related to one's firefighter career should be considered.

591,A Longitudinal Study of Psychological Factors as Mediators of the Relationship Between Insomnia Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation Among Young Adults,"Study Objectives: Prior cross-sectional studies indicate that psychological factors (eg, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness) may explain the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation. Longitudinal studies are needed, however, to examine how these variables may relate to one another over time. Using data collected at three time points, this study aimed to evaluate various psychological factors as mediators of the longitudinal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation.; Methods: Young adults (n = 226) completed self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, suicidal ideation, and psychological factors (ie, disgust with self, others, and the world; perceived burdensomeness; thwarted belongingness; and loneliness) at baseline (T1), 1-month follow-up (T2), and 2-month follow-up (T3). Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation models were utilized to evaluate each T2 psychological factor as a mediator of the relationship between T1 insomnia symptoms and T3 suicidal ideation severity, controlling for the corresponding T1 psychological factor and T1 suicidal ideation severity.; Results: Only T2 disgust with others and T2 disgust with the world significantly mediated the relationship between T1 insomnia symptoms and T3 suicidal ideation severity. When both mediators were included in the same model, only T2 disgust with the world emerged as a significant mediator.; Conclusions: Findings indicate that disgust with others, and particularly disgust with the world, may explain the longitudinal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation among young adults. These factors may serve as useful therapeutic targets in thwarting the trajectory from insomnia to suicidal ideation. Research is needed, however, to replicate these findings in higher risk samples.; Â© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.insomnia, mediation, psychological, sleep, suicide","Hom, Melanie A.; Stanley, Ian H.; Chu, Carol; Sanabria, Michelle M.; Christensen, Kirsten; Albury, Evan A.; Rogers, Megan L. & Joiner, Thomas E.",1,591
592,Exposure to suicide and suicide bereavement among women firefighters: Associated suicidality and psychiatric symptoms,"Objective: To examine experiences with suicide exposure and bereavement among women firefighters. Methods: Women firefighters (N = 266, Mage = 37.64y) completed selfâ€report measures assessing their experiences with suicide exposure, history of suicidality, current psychiatric symptoms, and suicide risk. Results: Threeâ€fourths (74.4%) of participants reported knowing someone who had died by suicide; of these participants, 31.3% reported losing a fellow firefighter to suicide. Exposure to suicide during one's firefighting career was associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms and suicide risk. Greater impact of a suicide death was significantly associated with more severe current suicide risk, even after controlling for prior suicidality and other psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Women firefighters exposed to suicide during their careers may experience more severe psychiatric symptoms and increased suicide risk as compared to their counterparts without this exposure. In particular, women firefighters who are more severely impacted by a suicide loss may be at increased suicide risk.

Women firefighters (n = 290) completed self-report measures of experiences with harassment on the job, career suicidality, and various psychiatric symptoms. Logistic regression analyses and one-way analyses of variance were used to address study aims. Of the sample, 21.7% reported having experienced sexual harassment and 20.3% reported having been threatened or harassed in another way on their firefighting job. Sexual harassment and other threats/harassment on the job were both significantly associated with a greater likelihood of reporting career suicidal ideation, as well as reporting more severe psychiatric symptoms. Harassment and threats experienced on the job may be associated with increased suicide risk and more severe psychiatric symptoms among women firefighters.

Consequently, Japanese society has begun to address such important issues as psychogenic disability and job-related suicide. Furthermore, given the aging of society and the surge in the number of elderly people requiring care, it is necessary to adequately and proactively support employees who care for their elderly relatives. The purpose of the present study was to investigate caregiver burden in caring for elderly relatives and work-related stress factors associated with mental health among employees.; Methods: We studied 722 men and women aged 18-83 years in a cross-sectional study. The K10 questionnaire was used to examine mental health status.; Results: The proportion of participants with a high K10 score was 15% (nÂ =Â 106). Having little conversation with their supervisor and/or coworkers significantly increased the risk of depression [odds ratio (OR) 1.8], as did high job overload (OR 2.7) and job dissatisfaction (OR 3.8), compared with employees who frequently conversed with their supervisor and/or coworkers. Caring for elderly relatives as a prominent characteristic of an employee was a significant risk factor for depression (OR 2.1).; Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that employees who were caring for elderly relatives were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression. To prevent depressive disorders, it may be important to focus on reducing the work-caregiving role conflict, as well as enhancing employees' job control and better rewarding their efforts in the workplace.; caregiving, depression, work-related stress","Honda, Ayumi; Date, Yutaka; Abe, Yasuyo; Aoyagi, Kiyoshi & Honda, Sumihisa",0,594
595,Sexual Violence as a Key Contributor to Poor Mental Health Among Japanese Women Subjected to Intimate Partner Violence,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) on mental health among Japanese women and to explore to what extent sexual IPV is an important contributor to the severity of mental health problems in comparison with physical and psychological IPV.; Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of the medical records of participants during psychiatric consultation at the Institute of Women's Health, Tokyo Women's Medical University, including 62 women who experienced IPV without sexual violence and 83 women who experienced IPV with sexual violence. Mental health problems were compared, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dissociative experiences.; Results: The results demonstrated a higher incidence and severity of somatic symptoms, insomnia, social dysfunction, severe depression and suicidality, PTSD, and dissociative experiences among women in the sexual IPV group than in the women who experienced IPV without sexual violence. In analyzing the relative contribution of sexual, physical, and psychological violence to the severity of mental health problems of the survivors, results indicated that sexual violence was an independent predictor of both PTSD and dissociative experiences.; Conclusions: The present research showed that significant adverse effects on mental health were observed among women who experienced IPV with sexual violence compared with the ones without. These findings provide important implications for considering the specific approaches to meet the needs of those women experiencing sexual IPV and the need for timely and effective interventions, including healthcare, social services, and primary prevention.; Anxiety/*psychology, Depression/*psychology, Dissociative Disorders/*psychology, Intimate Partner Violence/*psychology, Sex Offenses/*psychology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Adult, Anxiety/epidemiology, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depression/epidemiology, Dissociative Disorders/epidemiology, Female, Humans, Incidence, Intimate Partner Violence/ethnology, Japan/epidemiology, Mental Health, Middle Aged, Severity of Illness Index, Sex Offenses/ethnology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology, Suicide/ethnology, Japanese*, PTSD*, depression*, dissociation*, intimate partner sexual violence*","Honda, Tomoko; Wynter, Karen; Yokota, Jinko; Tran, Thach; Ujiie, Yuri; Niwa, Madoka; Nakayama, Michi; Ito, Fumie; Kim, Yoshiharu; Fisher, Jane & Kamo, Toshiko",0,595
596,Novel therapeutic approaches for various cancer types using a modified sleeping beauty-based gene delivery system,"Successful gene therapy largely depends on the selective introduction of therapeutic genes into the appropriate target cancer cells. One of the most effective and promising approaches for targeting tumor tissue during gene delivery is the use of viral vectors, which allow for high efficiency gene delivery. However, the use of viral vectors is not without risks and safety concerns, such as toxicities, a host immune response towards the viral antigens or potential viral recombination into the host's chromosome; these risks limit the clinical application of viral vectors. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based system is an attractive, non-viral alternative to viral delivery systems. SB may be less immunogenic than the viral vector system due to its lack of viral sequences. The SB-based gene delivery system can stably integrate into the host cell genome to produce the therapeutic gene product over the lifetime of a cell. However, when compared to viral vectors, the non-viral SB-based gene delivery system still has limited therapeutic efficacy due to the lack of long-lasting gene expression potential and tumor cell specific gene transfer ability. These limitations could be overcome by modifying the SB system through the introduction of the hTERT promoter and the SV40 enhancer. In this study, a modified SB delivery system, under control of the hTERT promoter in conjunction with the SV40 enhancer, was able to successfully transfer the suicide gene (HSV-TK) into multiple types of cancer cells. The modified SB transfected cancer cells exhibited a significantly increased cancer cell specific death rate. These data suggest that our modified SB-based gene delivery system can be used as a safe and efficient tool for cancer cell specific therapeutic gene transfer and stable long-term expression.; Genetic Vectors/*genetics, Neoplasms/*genetics, Neoplasms/*therapy, Transposases/*genetics, Animals, Cell Line, Gene Transfer Techniques, Humans, Mice, Mice, Inbred NOD, Mice, SCID, Transfection/methods","Hong, In-Sun; Lee, Hwa-Yong & Kim, Hyun-Pyo",0,596
597,"Prevalence, correlates, comorbidities, and suicidal tendencies of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in a nationwide sample of Korean women","Purpose: We examined the prevalence, correlates, comorbidities, and suicidal tendencies of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) according to the DSM-IV criteria in a nationwide sample of Korean women. Methods: A total of 2,499 women aged 18-64 years participated in this study. Diagnostic assessments were based on the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 2.1 and its 12-month PMDD diagnostic module, which were administered by lay interviewers. The frequencies of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, insomnia, and suicidal tendency were analyzed among PMDD cases and compared with non-PMDD cases, and both odds ratios and significance levels were calculated. Results: The 12-month prevalence rate of DSM-IV-diagnosed PMDD was 2.4%. Among subjects with PMDD, 59.3% had at least one psychiatric illness; in comparison, the control frequency was 21.8%. Associations between PMDD and alcohol abuse/dependence, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, somatoform disorder, insomnia, and suicidality were overwhelmingly positive and significant (p < 0.05), after controlling for age. Physical illness and being underweight were associated with increased risks of PMDD (p < 0.05). Conclusions: PMDD was prevalent in the nationwide sample of Korean women and was frequently associated with other psychiatric disorders, insomnia, and suicidality, suggesting the need to detect and treat women who experience PMDD.

A real-world study in a Japanese workplace,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a 4-week walking intervention on subjective sleep quality.Design: A prospective open-label study.Participants: A total of 490 healthy workers were included in the study. The 490 participants were divided into a group of 214 participants with exercise habits (exercising group, EG) and a group of 276 participants without exercise habits (non-EG).Interventions: A walking intervention with a target of walking 10 000 steps daily for 4 weeks.Outcome Measures: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was administered twice (before the start and after the end of the study).Results: Overall, the walking intervention improved the participants' PSQI global score, sleep latency (minutes), sleep duration (hours), perceived sleep quality factor and daily disturbance factor. Among the EG participants, the walking intervention significantly improved the PSQI global score and perceived sleep quality. Among the non-EG participants, the walking intervention significantly improved the PSQI global score, sleep latency, sleep duration and perceived sleep quality.Conclusions: A walking intervention might reduce the sleep latency and increase total sleep duration in working persons without exercise habits",Hori H; Ikenouchi-Sugita A; Yoshimura R; Nakamura J,0,598
599,Delirium and Agitation,"Delirium is a syndrome of altered state of consciousness and global cognitive impairment with diverse causes. It is common in the medically or surgically compromised patient and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The primary goal of treatment is to identify and correct the underlying cause of the delirium. Treatment includes protecting the patient from accidental self-harm, initiating pharmacotherapy to manage disruptive and dangerous behavior and symptoms of psychosis, and providing supportive and educational therapy for the patient and family. Physical restraints may need to be used for patients at immediate risk of injuring themselves or someone else until pharmacologic management can be initiated. Antipsychotics such as haloperidol with or without lorazepam are the treatment of choice. Environmental factors that may exacerbate delirium also need to be controlled. Patients should be reoriented and may benefit by having familiar or favorite objects present, such as family pictures. Sleep-wake disturbances must be corrected, and visual and auditory impairments must be addressed. Because family members can have a calming effect, provide frequent reorientation, and give the patient a sense of safety, family should be encouraged to be present if at all possible.; ","House, R.

600,"Associations between chronotypes, psychopathology, and personality among incoming college students","Chronotye is associated with age, sex, personality, and parental monitoring during childhood. The evening type is associated with poor school performance, sleep problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, tobacco smoking, caffeine consumption, alcohol drinking, and suicidality in adolescents. The present study tested the relationships between chronotype and a wide range of psychopathology and personality traits among 2919 incoming undergraduate students. Each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire that included demographics, plus the Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) scale, Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS), Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, and Maudesley Personality Inventory. The t-score distribution of the M-E scale was used to form the morning (t-score >60, n = 419), evening (t-score <40, n = 371), and intermediate (40 â‰¤ t-score â‰¤ 60, n = 2129) groups. Multivariable regression was employed for data analysis. For males, the evening type scored higher on all subscales of the BSRS than the morning type, except phobic anxiety. For females, the evening type had higher scores than the other two types on all subscales, except in obsession/compulsion and phobic anxiety, where the evening type only scored higher than the intermediate type. The evening type of both sexes also scored higher than the morning type in novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and neurotic personality characteristics, but lower than the morning type in extraversion and social desirability. In reward dependence, the evening type scored lowest for males, but there was no difference for females. The findings of the evening type being associated with possible psychopathology and certain types of personality have public health implications, that is, chronotype needs to be taken into account in the development of mental health prevention programs and assessment of and intervention for mental problems in young adults.

601,Psychiatric outcomes observed in patients living with HIV using six common core antiretrovirals in the Observational Pharmaco-Epidemiology Research and Analysis database,"Background: Psychiatric outcomes are common among people living with HIV and may be associated with specific antiretroviral use. We evaluated the occurrence of psychiatric outcomes in patients taking dolutegravir (DTG)-containing regimens compared with five other core agents.; Methods: Patients in the OPERA database prescribed regimens based on DTG, efavirenz (EFV), raltegravir (RAL), darunavir (DRV), rilpivirine (RPV), or elvitegravir (EVG) for the first time between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015 were analyzed. Psychiatric outcomes included diagnoses of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or suicidality during core agent exposure. Multivariable Cox analysis models were used to assess time to psychiatric outcomes between core agents stratified by psychiatric history, with DTG as the referent.; Results: A total of 13,261 patients initiated a regimen of interest (DTG: 2783; RAL: 979; EVG: 3895, EFV: 1746, RPV: 1921, DRV: 1937). Psychiatric history was common, with varied prevalence across groups (DTG 38%, EFV 24%, RAL 40%, DRV 34%, RPV 29%, EVG 31%). Among patients without a psychiatric history, the likelihood of a psychiatric outcome during follow up did not differ between DTG and the other core agents. Among patients with a psychiatric history, risk during follow up for patients taking DTG was equivalent (versus RPV), marginally reduced (versus RAL and EFV), or reduced (versus EVG and DRV).; Conclusions: In a large cohort of HIV+ patients in care, patients with a psychiatric history appeared channeled towards drugs with known favorable psychiatric safety profiles, including DTG. Despite this, DTG exposure was not associated with an increased risk of psychiatric outcomes during follow up in patients with or without a psychiatric history.; HIV, antiretroviral therapy, integrase strand transfer inhibitors, psychiatric outcomes","Hsu, Ricky; Fusco, Jennifer; Henegar, Cassidy; Mounzer, Karam; Wohlfeiler, Michael; Vannappagari, Vani; Aboud, Michael; Curtis, Lloyd & Fusco, Gregory",1,601
602,Undiagnosed bipolar disorder in patients treated for major depression in China,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a recurrent, complex illness and often misdiagnosed and treated as a major depressive disorder (MDD). This study set out (1) to investigate the proportion of BD in patients treated for MDD using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria; (2) to test the usefulness of the screening toolâ€”the 32-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) in Chinese patients; and (3) to assess whether MDD patients with subthreshold manic features (patients who screened positive for BD on the HCL-32, but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for DSM-IV BD as measured by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)) differ from those with BD, and from those suffering from MDD without manic features in terms of basic demographic and clinical variables. Methods: A total of 1487 patients treated for MDD were consecutively examined in 13 mental health centers in China. The patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. The HCL-32 was self-completed by patients to identify hypomanic symptoms, and the MINI was used by clinicians to establish DSM-IV diagnoses. Results: The proportions of undiagnosed BD (all types), BD-I and BD-II were 20.8%, 7.9% and 12.8%, respectively. The HCL-32 had low positive predictive value (0.43). Compared to MDD patients without subthreshold manic features, MDD patients with subthreshold manic features were younger at onset, less likely to be married and had more depressive episodes on a seasonal basis, and more frequent depressive episodes overall. Compared to BD patients, MDD patients with subthreshold manic features had an older age at onset and less frequent depressive episodes and less family history of psychiatric disorders, appetite, weight gain and time spent sleeping, suicide ideation and attempts and psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: At least one fifth of Chinese patients treated for MDD may have an undiagnosed BD. The HCL-32 is useful to identify broader subthreshold bipolar features. The findings need to be confirmed by longitudinal studies using more comprehensive, standardized instruments.

603,Factors Related to Complicated Grief among Bereaved Individuals after the Wenchuan Earthquake in China,"Background: The Wenchuan earthquake in China caused shock and grief worldwide. Sudden bereavement caused by the earthquake led to physical disorders as well as psychological disturbances in the bereaved individuals. The bereaved had a high risk for complicated grief (CG), which may have led to significant distress and impairment in their health. However, there was few available studies on CG among disaster-bereaved individuals in China after the disaster. The aim of this study was to identify factors (demographic characteristics and disaster-related variables) associated with symptoms of CG among the bereaved 18 months after the Wenchuan earthquake.; Methods: This study was conducted with a cross-sectional design and a convenience sample of 271 bereaved individuals from three of the hardest hit areas. Data were collected by questionnaires and the instruments used in the study were: General questionnaire and Inventory of CG (ICG). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with symptoms of CG.; Results: The mean score on ICG was 52.77 (standard deviation: 10.00). Being female and loss of a child were related to higher level of CG while having another child after the disaster and receiving psychological counseling experience were associated with lower level of CG. Forty-nine percent of the variance of CG was explained by these identified factors.; Conclusions: Eighteen months after the Wenchuan earthquake, the symptoms of CG among the bereaved were higher than the previous studies with bereaved individuals. This study uncovers a vulnerable population of the bereaved at high risk for CG. Early assessments, targeted interventions, and policy support tailored for the disaster-bereaved individuals are necessary to identify and alleviate symptoms of CG and to improve their well-being.; Grief*, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, Earthquakes, Female, Humans, Linear Models, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Surveys and Questionnaires","Hu, Xiao-Lin; Li, Xiao-Lin; Dou, Xin-Man & Li, Rong",0,603
604,"Risks of Treated Insomnia, Anxiety, and Depression in Health Care-Seeking Physicians: A Nationwide Population-Based Study","High occupational stress and burnout among physicians can lead to sleep problems, anxiety, depression, and even suicide. Even so, the actual risk for these behavioral health problems in health care-seeking physicians has been seldom explored. The aim of this study was to determine whether physicians have higher odds of treated insomnia, anxiety, and depression than the normal population.This is a nationwide population-based case-control study using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan for the years 2007 to 2011. Physicians were obtained from the Registry for Medical Personnel in 2009. Hospital physicians who had at least 3 coded ambulatory care claims or 1 inpatient claim with a principal diagnosis of insomnia, anxiety, or depression were identified. A total of 15,150 physicians and 45,450 matched controls were enrolled. Odd ratios (ORs) of insomnia, anxiety, and depression between physicians and their control counterparts were measured.The adjusted ORs for treated insomnia, anxiety, and depression among all studied physicians were 2.028 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.892-2.175), 1.103 (95% CI, 1.020-1.193), and 0.716 (95% CI, 0.630-0.813), respectively. All specialties of physicians had significantly higher ORs for treated insomnia; among the highest was the emergency specialty. The adjusted ORs for treated anxiety among male and female physicians were 1.136 (95% CI, 1.039-1.242) and 0.827 (95% CI, 0.686-0.997), respectively. Among specialties, psychiatry and others"" had significantly higher risks of anxiety. Obstetrics and gynecology and surgery specialties had significantly lower risks of anxiety. The adjusted ORs for treated depression among physicians in age groups 35 to 50 years and >50 years were 0.560 (95% CI 0.459-0.683) and 0.770 (95% CI 0.619-0.959) respectively. Those in the psychiatry specialty had significantly higher risks of depression; internal and surgery specialties had significant lower risks of depression.Hospital physicians have lower odds of treated depression than the general population although they have higher odd of treated insomnia and anxiety. Undertreatment was noted in some sex age and specialty subgroups of physicians.

605,Role of sleep quality in mediating the relationship between sexual minority status and suicidal behavior among Chinese adolescents,"Background: Studies suggest that sexual minority adolescents experience higher rates of sleep disturbance than their heterosexual peers, and disturbed sleep is a well-known risk factor for suicidality. This study aimed to explore whether sleep quality had mediating effects on the relationship between sexual minority status and suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents.; Methods: We analyzed data collected from 7th to 12th graders from seven randomly selected provinces of People's Republic of China in the 2015 School-Based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. The 123,459 students who completed questionnaires regarding sexual attraction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, past-year suicidal ideation, and past-year suicide attempts were included in our study (response rate: 95.9%).; Results: After adjustment for covariates, sexual minority status was associated with suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio =1.82, 95% CI=1.69-1.95) and suicide attempts (adjusted odds ratio =2.16, 95% CI=1.82-2.56). Sleep quality partially mediated the effects of sexual minority status on suicidal ideation (standardized Î² estimate=0.009, 95% CI=0.007-0.012) and suicide attempts (standardized Î² estimate=0.004, 95% CI=0.003-0.005).; Conclusion: Poor sleep quality partially explained the increased risk of suicidality for Chinese sexual minority adolescents. To prevent subsequent suicidality, suicide interventions targeting sexual minorities should be made, with a focus on their disparities in sleep disturbance and sleep health promotion.; adolescents, mediating effect, sexual minority, sleep quality, suicidal behavior","Huang, Yeen; Li, Pengsheng; Lai, Zhisheng; Jia, Xiaofei; Xiao, Di; Wang, Tian; Guo, Lan & Lu, Ciyong",1,605
606,"Predicting suicide in older adults”A community-based cohort study in Taipei City, Taiwan","Background: Older adults worldwide are at a greater risk of suicide than other age groups. There is a scarcity of prospective studies exploring risk factors for suicide in older people and their discriminative ability to identify future suicide. Methods: We examined a prospective cohort of senior Taipei City residents between 2005 and 2009 (N = 101,764). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine significant risk factors and to construct a predictive score. The accuracy of the derived score in the prediction was tested by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Results: Male sex (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 3.41, p < 0.001), lower education (HR = 3.31, p < 0.001) and lower income (HR = 2.52, p = 0.01) were associated with an increased risk of suicide, as well as depressed mood (HR = 1.44, p = 0.02; per unit increase in a 4-point scale) and insomnia (HR = 1.30, p = 0.03; per unit increase in a 4-point scale). The derived prediction score yielded a sensitivity of 0.63 a specificity of 0.73 and an area under curve of 0.73. Removing depressed mood from the prediction model did not significantly alter suicide predictability (P = 0.11). Limitations: The dataset examined did not contain information regarding to important risk factors such as substance misuse and prescribed medications and the measures of mental health were relatively limited. Conclusion: Prediction of suicide based on factors recorded in a routine health screen of elderly people was unsatisfactory; the strongest predictors were factors that cannot be easily altered. Further understanding of how the socioeconomic condition of seniors contributes to suicide may provide valuable insights for intervention targeting this growing population-at-risk.

607,"Prospective, open trial of adjunctive triple chronotherapy for the acute treatment of depression in adolescent inpatients","Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility and proof of concept of triple chronotherapy (TCT) as a nonpharmacological adjunctive treatment in the acute management of depression in the adolescent population. Methods: Thirty-one adolescents with nonpsychotic moderate-to-severe depression were included in the study. The 4-day TCT intervention comprised one night of sleep deprivation followed by 3 days of sleep phase advancement and daily bright light therapy. Primary outcomes were feasibility and depression, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17). Secondary outcomes included severity of illness, anxiety, self-harm, insomnia, and suicidality. Results: Twenty-nine (94%) adolescents completed the 4-day TCT intervention. Twenty-six (84%) of the 31 enrolled patients experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms of at least 50% from baseline; 24 (77%) achieved remission, defined as a HAMD-17 score less than 8.

Secondary outcomes showed significant improvement following the 4-day TCT intervention; improvement was sustained through the 1-week and 1-month follow-up periods. Conclusions: This pilot study determined TCT to be a feasible, safe, rapid, and potentially effective adjunctive treatment for depression in the adolescent population.

608,Quality of life 6 months after intensive care: results of a prospective multicenter study using a generic health status scale and a satisfaction scale,"Objective: To assess the quality of life of intensive care survivors 6 months after discharge.; Design: Multicenter prospective study.; Setting: Medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) of four French university hospitals.; Patients: Among the 589 patients admitted to the four ICUs between 1 January and 31 March 1989, 329 were investigated.; Measurements and Results: A generic scale assessing health-related quality of life, the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), a satisfaction scale, the Perceived Quality of Life scale (PQOL) and a questionnaire on professional status were sent by mail 6 months after discharge. Data concerning age, severity of acute illness (assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score) and main diagnosis were recorded. A total of 223 questionnaires (67.8 %) were analysable. The professional status remained unchanged in 79.7% of the patients, despite a significant (p < 0.01) increase (15.3 vs 22.1%) in sick leave. Quality of life, assessed with NHP, was fair (50th percentile = 0.73 on a 0 to 1 scale), whereas satisfaction measured by PQOL was lower (50th percentile = 0.61). Both scales correlated well (z = 9.853; p = 0.0001) but with a large dispersion. The NHP scale showed a severe reduction in energy, sleep and emotional reactions, whereas social isolation, pain and physical handicap were infrequent. Family support was rated with the PQOL score as very good, whereas dissatisfaction concerning recreational and professional activities was expressed. Subsequent sick leave was associated with a poor quality of life (p < 0.05). Quality of life was mainly a function of the diagnosis, not of age and severity of illness: patients admitted for suicide attempt or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease fared poorly.; Conclusions: Quality of life measured with a health-related quality of life scale and a satisfaction scale 6 months after an ICU stay depended on the admission diagnosis.

609,Intimate Partner Violence Associated With Poor Health Outcomes in US South Asian Women,"To assess the associations between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) victimization and health outcomes of South Asian women in Greater Boston. To explore the nature of the health experiences of victimized women in this population. Cross-sectional surveys with a community-based sample of women in relationships with males (n = 208) assessed demographics, IPV history, and health. In-depth interviews were conducted with a separate sample of women with a history of IPV (n = 23). Quantitative data were assessed by logistic regression, qualitative data by a grounded theory approach. Twenty-one percent of the quantitative sample reported IPV in the current relationship. Abused women were significantly more likely than those with no history of IPV in their current relationship to report poor physical health (95% CI = 1.3-12.0), depression (95% CI = 1.8-9.3), anxiety (95% CI = 1.3-6.4), and suicidal ideation (95% CI = 1.9-25.1). Qualitative subjects described how victimization resulted in injury and chronic health concerns and how IPV-induced depression and anxiety affected their sleep, appetite, energy, and well-being. Experiences of IPV are related to increased poor health among South Asian women. This elevated risk demands intervention. Healthcare providers should be trained to screen and refer South Asian patients for partner violence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

610,Age-Related Characteristics of Depression: A Preliminary STARD Report,"Objective: Studies have shown that age is a determinant in the course of major depressive disorder. Age has been associated with depression severity; it has also been associated with varying depressive symptomatology. The authors explore the relationships between current age and depression severity, course of illness, presenting symptom features, and comorbid symptoms. Methods: Baseline clinical and sociodemographic information was collected on 1,498 participants enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study. Five age cohorts (18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51-65, and 66-75) were compared on both sociodemographic and clinical factors. Depressive symptoms were measured with the 30-item clinician-rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Results: Clinically meaningful differences were found among age cohorts on several clinical and depressive symptom features. Older patients (51-65 and 66-75) endorsed longer durations of illness, more major depressive episodes, a later age at onset of their first major depressive episode, and more general medical comorbidities. Older patients had more middle and terminal insomnia, less irritability, and less hypersomnia. They were less likely to hold negative views of themselves or of their future and were less likely to report previous suicide attempts. Older patients were less likely to endorse symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and drug abuse. Conclusions: These cross-sectional data indicate that different age-cohorts present with varying sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as general-medical and psychiatric comorbid conditions.

611,Intravenous quetiapine abuse,"There are recent reports in the literature describing the intranasal abuse of quetiapine among jail inmates. Here we have provided a clinical case study of Ms. A who was a 34-year-old woman with a history of polysubstance dependence (alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine), depressive episodes associated with multiple suicide attempts, and borderline personality disorder who was incarcerated after conviction on charges of physical assault and possession of controlled substances. She had a history of incarceration on multiple occasions for similar charges. She complained of difficulty sleeping, poor impulse control, irritability, and depressed mood. For these symptoms, she was given oral quetiapine, 600 mg at bedtime. Rather than ingest the pills, she crushed the two tablets, dissolved them in water, boiled them, drew the solution through a cotton swab, and while lying in bed, covered by blankets, intravenously injected the solution. Twelve hours later, she was awoken by facility guards who found the syringe she used still in place on her arm. She informed the guards that she had intravenously injected herself with quetiapine the previous evening and became rapidly sedated, falling asleep before she could remove the syringe. Quetiapine treatment has been demonstrated to be associated with prolonging abstinence and decreasing the number of hospitalizations in patients with alcohol dependence and posttraumatic stress disorder. It is conceivable that such a progression from the use of quetiapine to its abuse either intranasally or intravenously is more prevalent than is currently assumed.

612,Is it possible to study sleep-wake patterns in adolescent borderline personality disorder? An actigraphic feasibility study,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by severe instability in mood, impulse control, relationships and sleep patterns, alongside with mild cognitive disturbances in some patients. Although research on adolescent BPD has developed over the last decade, little is known about circadian sleep-wake patterns in this population. Low compliance and cooperation frequently reported in these patients impede data collection. Therefore, research had to introduce non-invasive objective measurements such as actigraphy while minimizing attrition and resurgence of suicidal ideation. This article examined the feasibility of an actigraphic study with BPD adolescents. Eighteen BPD adolescents (13-17 years old) were recruited from a specialized outpatient mood disorders clinic and asked to wear an actigraph for nine days including two weekends. Twelve (66.7%) of the 18 BPD patients who consented kept the actigraph for an average of 11.00 days (SD: 2.04), thus completing the required 9-day period. The reasons surrounding difficulties during the experiment, such as aversive emotions during interviews, dermal irritation, fragile alliance with the research assistant, are described. The factors that contributed the most to our satisfactory compliance rate included stabilized mood before inclusion, close ties between the research and the clinical teams, rapid access to an emergency psychiatric assessment if needed.

613,Suicide incidence and risk factors in an active duty US military population,"Objectives: The goal of this study was to investigate and identify risk factors for suicide among all active duty members of the US military during 2005 or 2007. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design and included the entire active duty military population. Study sample sizes were 2,064,183 for 2005 and 1,981,810 for 2007. Logistic regression models were used. Results: Suicide rates for all services increased during this period. Mental health diagnoses, mental health visits, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), sleep prescriptions, reduction in rank, enlisted rank, and separation or divorce were associated with suicides. Deployments to Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom were also associated with elevated odds ratios for all services in the 2007 population and for the Army in 2005. Conclusions: Additional research needs to address the increasing rates of suicide in active duty personnel. This should include careful evaluation of suicide prevention programs and the possible increase in risk associated with SSRIs and other mental health drugs, as well as the possible impact of shorter deployments, age, mental health diagnoses, and relationship problems.

614,Sleep problems and self-harm in adolescence,"Background: Although self-harm and sleep problems are major public health problems in adolescence, detailed epidemiological assessment is essential to understand the nature of this relationship. Aims: To conduct a detailed assessment of the relationship between sleep and self-harm in adolescence. Method: A large population-based study in Norway surveyed 10 220 adolescents aged 16â€“19 years on mental health, including a comprehensive assessment of sleep and self-harm. Results: Adolescents with sleep problems were significantly more likely to report self-harm than those without sleep problems. Insomnia, short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency, wake after sleep on set as well as large differences between weekdays versus weekends, yielded higher odds of self-harm consistent with a doseâ€“response relationship. Depressive symptoms accounted for some, but not all, of this association. Conclusions: The findings highlight a strong relationship between sleep problems and self-harm. Interventions to reduce adolescent self-harm ought to incorporate sleep problems as a treatment target.

The risk factors for suicide ideation included demographic characteristics, such as gender (girls), low grades, low economic status, and not living with one or both parents. Behavioral and mental health risk factors affecting suicide ideation were depression, low sleep satisfaction, high stress, alcohol consumption, smoking, and sexual activity. Health care providers should particularly target adolescents manifesting the above risk factors when developing suicide prevention programs for them.

616,Associations of interleukin-6 with vegetative but not affective depressive symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients,"Purpose: Previous studies have reported associations of depressive symptoms with pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially with interleukin-6 (IL-6) in noncancer subjects and cancer patients. Meanwhile, symptoms such as tiredness and appetite loss may be vegetative symptoms of depression when associated with other diagnostic criteria of depression. Such vegetative-type symptoms worsen during the last 6 months of life in cancer patients and may not be associated with affective depressive symptoms such as sadness and nervousness. This study explored associations between depressive symptoms and plasma IL-6 in terminally ill cancer patients whose survival period was confirmed to be less than 6 months by follow-up, with attention to differences in vegetative and affective depressive symptoms.; Methods: Data from 112 consecutively recruited terminally ill cancer patients who registered at a palliative care unit without any active anticancer treatment were used. Plasma IL-6 levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence assay. Depressive symptoms included in the DSM-IV and Cavanaugh criteria were assessed by structured interviews and were categorized into affective symptoms and vegetative symptoms. Affective symptoms were also measured with the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, which does not include vegetative symptoms.; Results: Vegetative symptoms, such as appetite loss, insomnia, and fatigue, were significantly associated with IL-6 levels. However, neither of the affective symptoms nor their severity was associated with IL-6 levels.; Conclusions: IL-6 was associated with vegetative depressive symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients but not with affective depressive symptoms, suggesting possible differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms between these sets of symptoms.;Terminally Ill*, Depression/*blood, Depressive Disorder/*blood, Interleukin-6/*blood, Neoplasms/*blood, Adult, Aged, Anxiety/blood, Anxiety/complications, Anxiety/psychology, Depression/complications, Depression/psychology, Depressive Disorder/complications, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Fatigue/blood, Fatigue/complications, Fatigue/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/complications, Neoplasms/psychology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales","Inagaki, Masatoshi; Akechi, Tatsuo; Okuyama, Toru; Sugawara, Yuriko; Kinoshita, Hiroya; Shima, Yasuo; Terao, Kimio; Mitsunaga, Shuichi; Ochiai, Atsushi & Uchitomi, Yosuke",0,616

IFN-Î± and ribavirin are the approved treatment for HCV infection, but also carries a risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects, viz. insomnia, irritability, mood changes, and depression.We present a case report of depression induced by IFN-Î± and ribavirin, leading to attempted suicide. Following the episode, antidepressant paroxetine (20 mg o.d.) and zolpidem (10 mg h.s) were added with psychotherapy. No significant improvement was observed. Patient was given a drug dechallenge (IFN-Î± and ribavirin). Dramatic improvement was seen over 1 month. Following rechallenge with combination, patient again experienced depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation. IFN-Î± and ribavirin were promptly stopped.

618,Multi-scale motility amplitude associated with suicidal thoughts in major depression,"Major depression occurs at high prevalence in the general population, often starts in juvenile years, recurs over a lifetime, and is strongly associated with disability and suicide. Searches for biological markers in depression may have been hindered by assuming that depression is a unitary and relatively homogeneous disorder, mainly of mood, rather than addressing particular, clinically crucial features or diagnostic subtypes. Many studies have implicated quantitative alterations of motility rhythms in depressed human subjects. Since a candidate feature of great public-health significance is the unusually high risk of suicidal behavior in depressive disorders, we studied correlations between a measure (vulnerability index [VI]) derived from multi-scale characteristics of daily-motility rhythms in depressed subjects (n = 36) monitored with noninvasive, wrist-worn, electronic actigraphs and their self-assessed level of suicidal thinking operationalized as a wish to die. Patient-subjects had a stable clinical diagnosis of bipolar-I, bipolar-II, or unipolar major depression (n = 12 of each type). VI was associated inversely with suicidal thinking (r = â€“0.61 with all subjects and r = â€“0.73 with bipolar disorder subjects; both p < 0.0001) and distinguished patients with bipolar versus unipolar major depression with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 79.2%. VI may be a useful biomarker of characteristic features of major depression, contribute to differentiating bipolar and unipolar depression, and help to detect risk of suicide. An objective biomarker of suicide-risk could be advantageous when patients are unwilling or unable to share suicidal thinking with clinicians.

619,"Intimate Partner Violence, Suicide, and Their Overlapping Risk in Women Veterans: A Review of the Literature","Introduction: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are both serious and prevalent problems in the Veteran population that often occur in tandem, particularly among women Veterans. Women Veterans, the fastest growing segment of the Veteran population, may have unique overlapping risks that are worth exploring. Although the intersection of IPV and STB is well documented in the civilian population, it has not been thoroughly explored in women Veterans.; Materials and Methods: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, we conducted a systematic review of the STB and IPV literature specifically related to women Veterans. We only included articles that sampled women Veterans, rather than active duty/reservist/National Guard women; due to the small volume of STB research using samples of only women Veterans, we included studies that used mixed-gender samples. We extracted risk factors for STB and/or IPV involvement from 56 selected articles and placed them into tables for comparison to determine commonalities.; Results: Common risk factors fell into three categories: socio-demographic risk factors (young age, unemployment, and sexual minority status) were significant across both bodies of literature; mental health risk factors (general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, sleep disturbance, and substance use/abuse) also had significant overlap; and military service-related risk factors (military sexual trauma (MST) and deployment factors) were also relevant across both bodies of literature. Mental health risk factors, particularly PTSD, were the most common.; Conclusion: Frequently, the risk factors for IPV and STB are shared and it is important to consider how research, screening and intervention efforts for these serious problems might be integrated. Our exploration of the literature may be used as a basis for future research with women Veterans on the intersection of STB and IPV. Further, Veterans Health Administration clinicians should be aware of these intersecting risk factors to enhance care and improve screening for both issues in women Veteran clients.; ","Iovine-Wong, Paige E.; Nichols-Hadeed, Corey; Thompson Stone, Jennifer; Gamble, Stephanie; Cross, Wendi; Cerulli, Catherine & Levandowski, Brooke A.",0,619
620,Daily oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care: A 28-day open-label proof-of-concept trial,"Background: Depression and anxiety are prevalent and undertreated in patients receiving hospice care. Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. Methods: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Results: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35 = 8.03, p = 0.002, Î·Â² = 0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35 = 14.275, p < 0.001, Î·Â² = 0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Î” = 3.5, d = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-5.9, p = 0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Î” = 2.4, d = 0.67, 95% CI = 1.0-3.7, p = 0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Î” = 4.0, d = 1.34, 95% CI = 2.3-5.9, p = 0.001) and anxiety (mean Î” = 6.09, d = 1.34, 95% CI = 3.6-8.6, p < 0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. Conclusions: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted. The findings of the potential efficacy of oral ketamine for depression and the response of anxiety symptoms are novel. Further investigation with randomized, controlled clinical trials is necessary to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care or other subject populations.

The patterns of choice of antidepressants in the two areas accorded with prescribing patterns in two independent prescription surveys. Amitriptyline was chosen even more frequently for severe depression and depression with severe insomnia. Clomipramine was chosen comparatively more often for depression with severe anxiety. Low toxicity compounds (mainly lofepramine, mianserin, and moclobemide) were more often the drug of choice in depression associated with overt risk of suicide. Amitriptyline and clomipramine were used extensively for disorders other than depression (40% and 54% of prescriptions, compared with 13-19% for some other major antidepressants).; Conclusion: Patient groups treated with different antidepressant compounds may not be comparable with respect to diagnoses and severity of disease. In particular, lofepramine, mianserin, and moclobemide, and possibly amitriptyline, seem to be chosen more often for patients prone to suicide.;Attitude of Health Personnel*, Family Practice*, Psychiatry*, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects, Anxiety/drug therapy, Choice Behavior, Depression/drug therapy, Drug Utilization, Humans, Risk Factors, Rural Health, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/drug therapy, Suicide/prevention & control, Sweden, Urban Health","Isacsson, G; Redfors, I; Wasserman, D & Bergman, U",0,621
622,Non specific drug distribution in an autopsy case report of fatal caffeine intoxication,"Caffeine has long been recognized as an addictive substance that causes autonomic nerve effect, and is known to increase catecholamine secretion from the adrenal glands. In recent years, the risk of ingesting toxic levels of caffeine has increased because of the easy availability of analgesics, CNS (Central Nervous System) stimulant medicine and dietary supplements at shops, health stores and through online purchases. We report the death of a young female resulting from the ingestion for suicide of an online purchased sleepiness-preventing medicine containing caffeine. The autopsy findings included pulmonary edema and congestion plus cutaneous emphysema. The stomach contents included a dark-brown viscous fluid without tablet or food residue. Toxicological examination revealed the presence of caffeine in the right heart blood (154.2 Î¼g/mL) and stomach contents (197.5 Î¼g/mL) (lethal blood level, >80 Î¼g/mL). The highest caffeine content was in the bile (852.3 Î¼g/mL). Biochemical findings showed that catecholamine concentration in the peripheral blood in the iliac vein was elevated. Immunostaining of catecholamine was weak in the adrenal medulla. We recommend highlighting the toxicity risk of ingesting substances with a high caffeine concentration, and we propose that caffeine concentrations should be included in the comprehensive routine forensic toxicological tests for all cases.; Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Face-to-face structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 443 women contacted at health facilities in the northern region. Results indicate that 7 out of 10 women have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) within the past 12 months; 62% had experienced psychological violence, 29% had experienced physical violence, and 34% had experienced sexual violence. Participants reported health problems associated with violence, including injury, thoughts of suicide, sleep disruption, and fear of partner (FP). Logistic regression analyses showed that women who reported physical, psychological, and sexual violence, respectively, had 3.94 times, 10.50 times, and 2.21 times the odds of reporting thoughts of suicide, whereas the odds that women who reported physical, psychological, and sexual violence would report sleep disruption were 4.82 times higher, 4.44 times higher, and 2.50 times higher, respectively. However, only physical and psychological violence predicted the odds of FP. This study shows that IPV is a health risk factor among women in Ghana. Measures that should be designed to improve the health of women experiencing marital violence are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

624,The Challenges of Psychopharmacological Management of Children with Severe Developmental Disabilities,"M is a 10-year, 4-month old girl who was initially referred for psychiatric evaluation at age 6 years due to increased aggression, impulsive, disruptive behavior, and elevated risk for self-injury. Prior to her referral, M had been diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, profound mental retardation, Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Disruptive Behavior Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), and Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. M was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, profound mental retardation, and Autistic Spectrum Disorder at 3 years of age. She was started on phenobarbital and phenytoin but subsequently switched to valproic acid (VPA) 150 mg/day secondary to a Stevens Johnson reaction to the phenobarbital and phenytoin (see Table 1). The child and adolescent psychiatrist recommended a trial of risperidone to address the behavioral difficulty, which was initiated at 0.25 mg at bedtime and subsequently increased to 0.5 mg twice daily over a period of 2 weeks. Following the initiation of risperidone, M's behavior became more manageable. At the expense of some morning drowsiness, she seemed to respond better to her foster parent and was sleeping through the night. M's case highlights empirically observed challenges in the management of these severely affected children with neurological, developmental, and psychiatric co-morbidities. Children with severe developmental delays and co-morbid neurological and psychiatric disorders may be unpredictably vulnerable to potential drug-drug interactions, even when the drugs are used in conventional doses and serum levels appear therapeutic.

625,Application of The APA Practice Guidelines on Suicide to Clinical Practice,"This article presents charts from The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Patients with Suicidal Behaviors, part of the Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders Compendium, and a summary of the assessment information in a format that can be used in routine clinical practice. Four steps in the assessment process are presented: the use of a thorough psychiatric examination to obtain information about the patient's current presentation, history, diagnosis, and to recognize suicide risk factors therein; the necessity of asking very specific questions about suicidal ideation, intent, plans, and attempts; the process of making an estimation of the patient's level of suicide risk is explained; and the use of modifiable risk and protective factors as the basis for treatment planning is demonstrated. Case reports are used to clarify use of each step in this process.;Practice Guidelines as Topic*, Practice Patterns, Physicians'*, Depression, Postpartum/*psychology, Suicide/*prevention & control, Adult, Aged, Depression, Postpartum/complications, Female, Humans, Male, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/complications","Jacobs, Douglas G & Brewer, Margaret L",0,625
626,Suvorexant for the treatment of insomnia,"Suvorexant (Belsorma(Â®)) is the first orexin receptor antagonist approved by the US FDA (August 2014) for insomnia treatment. Following comprehensive Phase II/III studies, with up to 12 months of treatment in adult and elderly patients, there is little doubt that suvorexant induces and maintains sleep. However, the FDA and sponsor disagreed about effective versus safe doses (November 2012). The FDA considered that 5-15 mg were efficient and probably safe, whereas the sponsors had proposed 15-40 mg. The final approved doses are 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg. The major issues are next-morning somnolence and safety as seen in driving tests, with possible signs of muscle weakness, weird dreams, sleep walking, other nighttime behaviors and suicidal ideation. Despite its limitations, suvorexant's market entry offers a truly novel treatment for insomnia, paving the way for follow-up compounds and opening therapeutic avenues in other disorders for orexin receptor modulating compounds.;Azepines/*therapeutic use, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*drug therapy, Triazoles/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Animals, Azepines/administration & dosage, Azepines/pharmacology, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Approval, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/administration & dosage, Hypnotics and Sedatives/pharmacology, Orexin Receptor Antagonists, Triazoles/administration & dosage, Triazoles/pharmacology, United States, United States Food and Drug Administration, Belsorma, FDA, NDA, SB649868, almorexant, drug development, hypocretin, insomnia, orexin, orexin receptor antagonists, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, sleep disorders, suvorexant","Jacobson, Laura H; Callander, Gabrielle E & Hoyer, Daniel",1,626
627,Psychopharmacotherapy prescription and suicidal behaviour,"Suicidal behaviour has multiple causes. Psychiatric disorder is a major contributing factor. Consecutively, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders has an impact on suicide rate. The studies that investigated the possible impact of psychopharmacotherapy prescription practise on suicide rate have been gathered in the present article. Ongoing discussion of potential benefits and risks of antidepressant treatment with respect to suicidal behaviours includes many ecological, or population- based, correlational studies of temporal or regional trends in suicide rates and rates of usage of modern antidepressants including SSRIs. A number of studies have found a relationship between increase in national antidepressant prescribing and declining suicide rates, with general agreement but some exceptions. In general, studies showed that increased prescribing of antidepressants may indicate improved diagnosis and treatment of depression. On the other hand, studies that investigated the impact of prescription of anxyolitics on suicide rate were scarce, although the ratio of anxiolytics to antidepressants has been described as a quality indicator regarding treatment of depression, which is in most cases combined with anxiety and increased suicide risk. Importantly, sedatives and hypnotics are widely prescribed to elderly persons with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, but studies demonstrated that sedatives and hypnotics were both associated with increased risk for suicide in the elderly. Finally, studies on antipsychotic prescription demonstrated that particularly treatment with clozapine decreased suicide mortality among individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders and on the other hand lithium reduced suicide rate among individuals with mood disorders.;Suicide*/statistics & numerical data, Mental Disorders/*drug therapy, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use, Humans","Jagodic, Helena Korosec; Agius, Mark & Pregelj, Peter",0,627
628,"Cholecystokinin (CCK) level is higher among first time suicide attempters than healthy controls, but is not associated with higher depression scores","Suicide and suicide attempts are dramatic events for both the individuals concerned and for their social environments. Efforts have been made to identify reliable biological predictors of suicide and suicide attempts. In the present study, we focused on one potential marker, cholecystokinin (CCK), among first time suicide attempters. A total of 25 suicide attempters (mean age: 30 years; 80% females) and 23 healthy controls were enrolled in the present cross-sectional study. Experts rated participants' symptoms of depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS). Blood levels of CCK levels were assessed. Suicide attempters had CCK levels 22.67 times higher and HDRS scores 14.33 higher than healthy controls. CCK levels were only weakly associated with HDRS scores. CCK appears to be a fairly reliable biomarker for suicide attempts. However, CCK levels were not associated with depression scores, making it difficult to match biological markers to depressive behaviour.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

629,Physical Pain and History of Suicidal Behaviors in Alcohol-Dependent Patients Entering Treatment in Poland,"Background: Individuals with alcohol use disorders have been shown to be at increased risk for suicidal behaviors and chronic pain.; Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct initial analyses of the association between current physical pain and the likelihood of suicidal behavior history in alcohol-dependent patients entering treatment in Poland.; Methods: A sample of 366 (73.5% men and 26.5% women) participants were recruited from alcohol treatment centers in Warsaw, Poland. Information was obtained about a history of lifetime suicidal behavior, past 4-week pain level, demographics, social functioning, childhood abuse, depressive symptoms, severity of alcohol and sleep problems.; Results: A total of 118 individuals (32.2%) reported at least one suicidal behavior during their lifetime. In unadjusted analyses, there was a significant association between a history of lifetime suicidal behavior and a moderate or greater experience of physical pain during the last four weeks. Other variables that were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors were: younger age, history of childhood abuse, depressive symptoms, sleep problems, consequences of drinking, and lower social support. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only experience of moderate or greater pain, age, and depressive symptoms remained significantly associated with a history of suicidal behavior.; Conclusions: The experience of physical pain is significantly associated with a lifetime history of suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent patients. Clinicians should be aware of these associations when conducting assessments and treating alcohol use disorders.; Suicidal Ideation*, Alcoholism, Child, Child Abuse, Female, Humans, Male, Pain, Poland, Risk Factors, Suicide, Attempted, Alcohol dependence*, childhood abuse*, depressive symptoms*, physical pain*, suicidal behavior*","Jakubczyk, Andrzej; Ashrafioun, Lisham; Ilgen, Mark; Kopera, Maciej; Klimkiewicz, Anna; Krasowska, Aleksandra; Solowiej, Malgorzata; Brower, Kirk J. & Wojnar, Marcin",1,629
630,The CC genotype in the T102C HTR2A polymorphism predicts relapse in individuals after alcohol treatment,"The serotonin system is hypothesized to contribute to predisposition and course of alcohol dependence. However, the potential association between the T102C polymorphism (rs6313) in the type 2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A) gene and treatment outcomes in alcohol dependence has not been investigated. The aim of the study was to assess the contribution of this genetic polymorphism as a predictor of relapse in relation to other previously identified predictors. A sample of 254 alcohol dependent subjects, were recruited in alcohol treatment centers in Warsaw, Poland and prospectively assessed at baseline and follow-up after 12 months. At baseline, information about demographics, psychopathological symptoms and alcohol problems was obtained. The stop-signal task was performed and blood samples for genetic analysis of HTR2A T102C (rs6313) were collected. Relapse was defined as any drinking during the follow-up period. The statistical analysis showed that the CC genotype was significantly associated with increased relapse. Other significant factors were baseline depressive symptoms, number of drinking days during the 3 months prior to the baseline assessment, severity of alcohol-related problems, and a lifetime history of impulsive suicide attempts. Logistic regression analysis with and without the genetic factor revealed that adding the genetic factor increased the R square value by about 4%, with the CC genotype in the T102C polymorphism being the strongest predictor of relapse (OR = 2.32). The significant influence on relapse of the CC genotype, which is associated with fewer 5-HT2A receptors in the central nervous system, suggests the possibility that this genetic polymorphism could influence response to serotonergic medications.

631,"Here and now aboriginal assessment: Background, development and preliminary evaluation of a culturally appropriate screening tool","Objective: Assessment of Aboriginal social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) is a complex and challenging task, in part due to a lack of suitable assessment tools. This paper reports the development and evaluation of a culturally appropriate screening tool called the Here and Now Aboriginal Assessment (HAA). Method: The initial phase included development of a glossary of Aboriginal terms and concepts relating to SEWB. The glossary was used to identify 10 key HAA domains, which included physical health, sleep, mood, suicide risk and self harm, substance use, memory, unusual experiences, functioning, life stressors and resilience. Evaluation of the HAA included exploration of its cultural applicability, feasibility, reliability and validity. Results: The HAA was well accepted by study participants and easily implemented by assessors. Reliability was good, with inter-rater agreements between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal assessors measured by Kappa statistics ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. There was also a good agreement between assessors and treating clinicians in identifying the main presenting problem and recommended course of action. Conclusion: The HAA is a culturally appropriate and useful tool for the screening of SEWB among Aboriginal adults. It can also be used for teaching and training purposes of mental health and other professionals working with Aboriginal people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

632,Relationship between current sleep duration and past suicidal ideation or attempt among Korean adolescents,"Objectives: To comprehensively examine the relationship between current sleep duration and past suicidal idea or attempt among Korean adolescents.; Methods: Data came from the 2009 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey with 75 066 participants (with the participation rate of 97.6%) in 800 middle and high schools. Binary logistic regression was conducted by gender and depressed mood to identify significant factors for suicidal ideation/attempt. The dependent variable was the log odds of suicidal ideation/attempt, while the independent/control variables were sleep duration and other demographic, socio-economic and health-related factors.; Results: A negative association between sleep duration and suicidal ideation or attempt was weaker for those with depressed mood than for those without such experience in Korea for Year 2009. The odds ratio of suicidal ideation/attempt regarding less than 4 hours of sleep compared to 6 to 7 hours of sleep, was smaller in a group with depressed mood than in a group without such experience, for example, 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29 to 2.08) vs. 2.06 (95% CI, 1.34 to 3.17) for men's suicidal ideation, 2.50 (95% CI, 1.69 to 3.69) vs. 3.89 (95% CI, 1.74 to 8.66) for men's suicidal attempt. A negative association between age (or self-rated health) and suicidal ideation/attempt was also weaker for those with depressed mood than for those without such experience in the nation for the year.; Conclusions: There was a negative association between sleep duration and suicidal ideation/attempt in Korea for Year 2009 and this association was weaker for those with depressed mood than for those without such experience. Based on the findings of this study, adolescents' better mental health and longer, more comfortable sleep might help to prevent their suicidal ideation and attempt in Korea.;Sleep*, Suicidal Ideation*, Adolescent, Demography, Female, Humans, Internet, Logistic Models, Male, Odds Ratio, Republic of Korea, Sex Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data, Time Factors, User-Computer Interface, Adolescent, Depressed mood, Korea, Sleep duration, Suicidal attempt, Suicidal ideation","Jang, Sung-In; Lee, Kwang-Sig & Park, Eun-Cheol",1,632
633,From phenomenology to neurophysiological understanding of hallucinations in children and adolescents,"Typically reported as vivid, multisensory experiences which may spontaneously resolve, hallucinations are present at high rates during childhood. The risk of associated psychopathology is a major cause of concern. On the one hand, the risk of developing further delusional ideation has been shown to be reduced by better theory of mind skills. On the other hand, ideas of reference, passivity phenomena, and misidentification syndrome have been shown to increase the risk of self-injury or heteroaggressive behaviors. Cognitive psychology and brain-imaging studies have advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these early-onset hallucinations. Notably, specific functional impairments have been associated with certain phenomenological characteristics of hallucinations in youths, including intrusiveness and the sense of reality. In this review, we provide an update of associated epidemiological and phenomenological factors (including sociocultural context, social adversity, and genetics, considered in relation to the psychosis continuum hypothesis), cognitive models, and neurophysiological findings concerning hallucinations in children and adolescents. Key issues that have interfered with progress are considered and recommendations for future studies are provided.; Â© The Author 2014.

634,Psychologic aspects of sexual abuse in adolescence,"This paper reviews psychologic aspects of sexual abuse in female adolescents. It documents that sexual abuse is widespread, occurring at an alarming rate at all socioeconomic levels of society. It is perpetrated principally by adult men in the victim's family. Often its effects are tragic. Adolescent female sexual abuse victims are at high risk for subsequent acting out behavior, sexual promiscuity, physical and sexual abuse, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, alcohol and drug abuse or dependence, chronic sleep disturbance, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, emotional numbing, dissociation, guilt, shame, hyperalertness, suicidal ideation, and multiple associated psychiatric disorders. Although it may appear at a surface level that sexual abuse victims recover from such abuse, follow-up studies suggest that many remain disabled long after the abuse has ended. Health care professionals should be especially cognizant of the magnitude of the impact of sexual abuse on adolescent girls and recognize the need of these patients for psychologic and medical services.;Psychology, Adolescent*, Child Abuse, Sexual/*psychology, Adolescent, Child Abuse, Sexual/complications, Child Abuse, Sexual/epidemiology, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Female, Humans, Mental Disorders/epidemiology, Mental Disorders/etiology, Rape/psychology, Rape/statistics & numerical data, Risk Factors, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/etiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology","Jeffrey, T B & Jeffrey, L K",0,634

These students were recruited from two high schools in Lijin County, Shandong Province, China by using a stratified random cluster sampling method. Overall, 13.5% of the sample reported having suicidal ideation in the past year, and there was no significant difference between boys and girls in reporting rate of suicidal ideation. Nightmares, physical activity, and sleep duration as well as family environment, paternal education, and mental heath status were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. More efforts for these factors should be considered in suicide prevention for high school students in rural China.

636,Sleep disturbance and attempted suicide in rural China: A case-control study,"This study aimed to examine the association between sleep disturbance and attempted suicide in rural China. The study group included 409 suicide attempters from six rural counties in Shandong Province, China and an equal number of controls matched on age, sex, and residency. Sleep disturbance was assessed by the item â€œsleep restlessâ€ in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Sleep disturbance was reported more frequently in suicide attempters than in controls (1-2 days/week, 9.0% vs. 4.4%; 3-4 days/week, 11.5%vs. 2.4%; â‰¥5 days/week, 30.3% vs. 7.5%, Ï‡Â² = 128.72, p < 0.001).

637,Suicidal ideation and the risk of suicide in patients with fibromyalgia: A comparison with non-pain controls and patients suffering from low-back pain,"Fibromyalgia is associated with an increased rate of mortality from suicide. In fact, this disease is associated with several characteristics that are linked to an increased risk of suicidal behaviors, such as being female and experiencing chronic pain, psychological distress, and sleep disturbances. However, the literature concerning suicidal behaviors and their risk factors in fibromyalgia is sparse. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and the risk of suicide in a sample of patients with fibromyalgia compared with a sample of healthy subjects and a sample of patients with chronic low-back pain. We also aimed to evaluate the relevance of pain intensity, depression, and sleep quality as variables related to suicidal ideation and risks. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the likelihood of suicidal ideation and the risk of suicide adjusted by age and sex. We also used two logistic regression models using age, sex, pain severity score, depression severity, sleep quality, and disease state as independent variables and using the control group as a reference. Forty-four patients with fibromyalgia, 32 patients with low-back pain, and 50 controls were included. Suicidal ideation, measured with item 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory, was almost absent among the controls and was low among patients with low-back pain; however, suicidal ideation was prominent among patients with fibromyalgia (P < 0.0001). The risk of suicide, measured with the Plutchik Suicide Risk Scale, was also higher among patients with fibromyalgia than in patients with low-back pain or in controls (P < 0.0001). The likelihood for suicidal ideation and the risk of suicide were higher among patients with fibromyalgia (odds ratios of 26.9 and 48.0, respectively) than in patients with low-back pain (odds ratios 4.6 and 4.7, respectively). Depression was the only factor associated with suicidal ideation or the risk of suicide. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

638,Insomnia in patients with depression: Some pathophysiological and treatment considerations,"The almost ubiquitous sleep disturbances in patients with depression commonly, but not always, subside with the remission of depression. Evidence linking insomnia with the risk of relapses in recurrent depression, as well as suicide, makes optimization of the treatment of insomnia associated with depression a priority. However, most antidepressant agents do not adequately address the sleep complaints in depression: their effects on sleep range from sizeable improvement to equally significant worsening. One approach to the management of insomnia associated with depression is to choose a sedating antidepressant agent such as trazodone, mirtazapine or agomelatine. A second approach is to start with a non-sedating antidepressant (e.g. the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, venlafaxine or duloxetine); those with a persistent or treatment-emergent insomnia can be switched to a more sedating antidepressant, or offered a hypnotic or cognitive-behavioural therapy as adjunctive treatment. The review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of all treatment options, pharmacological and otherwise. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

639,Validation and factor structure of the Thai version of the EURO-D scale for depression among older psychiatric patients,"Objectives: To assess the concurrent and the construct validity of the Euro-D in older Thai persons. Method: Eight local psychiatrists used the major depressive episode section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to interview 150 consecutive psychiatric clinic attendees. A trained interviewer administered the Euro-D. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the overall discriminability of the Euro-D scale and principal components factor analysis to assess its construct validity. Results: The area under the ROC curve for the Euro-D with respect to major depressive episode was 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.90] indicating moderately good discriminability. At a cut-point of 5/6 the sensitivity for major depressive episodes is 84.3%, specificity 58.6%, and kappa 0.37 (95% CI 0.22-0.52) indicating fair concordance. However, at the 3/4 cut-point recommended from European studies there is high sensitivity (94%) but poor specificity (34%). The principal components analysis suggested four factors. The first two factors conformed to affective suffering (depression, suicidality and tearfulness) and motivation (interest, concentration and enjoyment). Sleep and appetite constituted a separate factor, whereas pessimism loaded on its own factor. Conclusion: Among Thai psychiatric clinic attendees Euro-D is moderately valid for major depression. A much higher cut-point may be required than that which is usually advocated. The Thai version also shares two common factors as reported from most of previous studies.

Psychiatric disorders, physical illnesses, disabilities, functional status and stress were assessed among 4651 female patients (aged 18-99 yrs) at 8 primary care and 7 obstetric gynecology clinics throughout the US. 289 women (6.2%) were diagnosed with BN or BED. The prevalence of BN was approximately 1% among young and middle-aged women. The prevalence of BED increased steadily from early through middle adulthood. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders and diabetes were much more common among women with BN or BED than among women without these eating disorders. Women with BN or BED reported markedly poorer functioning and much higher levels of disability, health problems, insomnia, psychosocial stress and suicidal thoughts than did women without BN or BED, after co-occurring psychiatric disorders were controlled statistically. Yet, fewer than 1 of 10 cases of BN or BED was recognized by the patients' physicians. The authors argue that increased recognition of eating disorders is a crucial step towards encouraging more patients to seek treatment for disability, impairment, distress and co-occurring illnesses.

Estimates were made using an epidemiologic measure, population attributable risk. Population attributable risk is a compound measure reflecting both the morbid risk to an individual with a disorder and the prevalence of the disorder in the community.; Design: Epidemiologic survey.; Participants: Eighteen thousand five hundred seventy-one adults in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study interviewed from a complex random sample in five US communities.; Outcome Measures: Suicide attempts, use of psychoactive medications, self-reported physical and emotional health, time lost from work, and general medical services or use of emergency departments for emotional problems.; Results: Major depression-dysthymia (lifetime prevalence, 6.1%) and depressive symptoms (lifetime prevalence, 23.1%) were associated with increased service utilization and social morbidity as measured by the outcome variables. On a population basis, however, as much or more service burden and impairment was associated with depressive symptoms as with the clinical conditions of depression or dysthymia. The equal association results from the greater prevalence of depressive symptoms. Population attributable risk percentages associated with depressive symptoms (not disorder) were as follows: emergency department use (11.8%) or medical consultations for emotional problems (21.5%); use of tranquilizers (14.6%), sleeping pills (21.0%), or antidepressants (22.2%); fair or poor self-reported emotional health (15.3%); days lost from work (17.8%); and suicide attempts (25.0%).; Conclusions: Estimates of population attributable risk indicated that physicians actually provided services to more persons with depressive symptoms than to persons with formally defined conditions of depressive disorders.

Adolescents with eating disorders were at a substantially elevated risk for anxiety disorders, cardiovascular symptoms, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, depressive disorders, limitations in activities due to poor health, infectious diseases, insomnia, neurological symptoms, and suicide attempts during early adulthood after age, sex, socioeconomic status, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, adolescent health problems, body mass index, and worries about health during adulthood were controlled statistically. Problems with eating or weight during adolescence predicted poor health outcomes during adulthood, regardless of whether an eating disorder had been present. Only 22% of the adolescents with current eating disorders had received psychiatric treatment within the past year.

643,Add-on lithium for the treatment of unipolar depression: Too often forgotten?,"Presents a case report of 61-year-old man admitted to the emergency department with increasing fatigue and irritability, which had started 2 months prior in the context of urinary retention due to benign prostatic hypertrophy. One month later, he was successfully operated, but his anxiety increased sharply in association with low mood, anhedonia, lack of motivation, poor concentration and decreased sleep and appetite. He had no suicidal intent. A severe major depressive episode was diagnosed. This patientâ€™s case illustrates the potential benefits of lithium in the acute treatment of unipolar depression. Side effects, narrow therapeutic margin and regular blood and urinary screening explain some cliniciansâ€™ reluctance to prescribe lithium. Lithium was also confirmed as a potent anti-suicidal drug in a recent meta analysis -a finding that is particularly relevant here given our patientâ€™s family history. Lithium should be used at blood levels between 0.5 and 0.8 mmol/L, and sparse data suggest that if efficient, it should be maintained for a period of at least 1 year to avoid recurrence. Finally, although antidepressant mechanisms are largely unknown, support for neuroprotective effects has been convincing. While lithium is not a panacea, the literature supports a broader use of this drug.

644,Describing the mental health profile of first responders: A systematic review ,"Background: First responders (FRs) are responsible for providing multiple services during various critical events. Considering the frequency, nature, and intensity of duty-related traumatic exposures, the cumulative impact on FRsâ€™ mental health is of paramount importance. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review was to describe how duty-related trauma exposure can affect the comprehensive mental health profile of FRs, including firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and paramedics. Design: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a literature search was conducted using keywords related to FRs and mental health. Results: Twenty-seven data-based articles met eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. Studies explored various mental health concerns, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidality, anxiety, alcohol use, and sleep disturbances. Conclusions: Findings pose significant implications for psychiatric nurses in practice and research, including the need for tailored strategies to meet the mental health needs of this at-risk population.

645,Prevalence and correlates of psychiatric symptoms among first responders in a Southern State,"First responders (FRs) respond to critical incidents as an expectation of their profession, and after years of service, exposure to trauma can accumulate and potentially lead to mental health problems, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A gap persists in the research regarding duty-related risk factors and prevalence of mental health problems among FRs. Guided by existing evidence and in partnerships with the state's FR community, this study assessed the mental health needs of FRs, risk factors that may contribute to these problems, and the associations therein. A convenience sample of firefighters and emergency medical technicians/paramedics (nâ€¯=â€¯220) were recruited from across Arkansas to complete an online survey. This survey incorporated brief assessment tools to measure various mental health problems, and captured other data regarding possible risk factors. Results found that 14% reported moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms, 28% reported moderate-severe and severe anxiety symptoms, 26% reported significant symptoms of PTSD, 31% reported harmful/hazardous alcohol use and dependence, 93% reported significant sleep disturbances, and 34% indicated high risk for suicide. Significant group differences were found across measures and gender (female), shift-structure (48â€¯h or more), department setting (rural), relationship status (non-partnered), and having a medical history of hypertension. These findings pose significant implications for mental healthcare providers, as well as other healthcare providers and FR organizations. Findings will guide future research that will address the need for changes in decision-making, funding, and policy regarding FRs' MH and MH services available to them.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

646,Predicting suicidal ideation in primary care: An approach to identify easily assessable key variables,"Objective: To obtain predictors of suicidal ideation, which can also be used for an indirect assessment of suicidal ideation (SI). To create a classifier for SI based on variables of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and sociodemographic variables, and to obtain an upper bound on the best possible performance of a predictor based on those variables. Methods: From a consecutive sample of 9025 primary care patients, 6805 eligible patients (60% female; mean age = 51.5 years) participated. Advanced methods of machine learning were used to derive the prediction equation. Various classifiers were applied and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed as a performance measure. Results: Classifiers based on methods of machine learning outperformed ordinary regression methods and achieved AUCs around 0.87. The key variables in the prediction equation comprised four items - namely feelings of depression/hopelessness, low self-esteem, worrying, and severe sleep disturbances. The generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the somatic symptom subscale (PHQ-15) did not enhance prediction substantially. Conclusions: In predicting suicidal ideation researchers should refrain from using ordinary regression tools. The relevant information is primarily captured by the depression subscale and should be incorporated in a nonlinear model. For clinical practice, a classification tree using only four items of the whole PHQ may be advocated.

647,Non-medical use of psychoactive drugs in relation to suicide tendencies among Chinese adolescents,"Introduction: To investigate the prevalence of non-medical use of psychoactive prescription drug (NMUPD) among adolescents and to explore the associations between non-medical psychoactive prescription drug use and depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, deliberate self-harm, and suicide. Methods: A two-stage stratified cluster sample design produced a representative sample of 12-19-year-old students in grades 1-6 who attended public middle schools in Guangdong province. Prevalence estimates (SE) of non-medical psychoactive prescription drug use were calculated, and logistic regression was used to examine its association with depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, deliberate self-harm, and suicide. Results: Overall, 7.5% of adolescents reported non-medical use of opioids, and 4.8% of adolescents reported non-medical use of sedatives. Lifetime, last-year, and last-month non-medical use of opioids and sedatives were positively associated with depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts among different gender and age-group adolescents. Those who reported last month non-medical use of opioids and sedatives had the greatest odds of reporting depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts. Males who were last month non-medical users of opioids or sedative had 8.9 or 10.7 times greater odds of reporting a suicidal attempt, and 8.8 or 9.8 times greater odds of reporting a suicidal attempt were observed among adolescents aged 16-19 who were last-month non-medical users of opioids or sedatives. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for improving adolescents' suicide prevention strategy by targeting supervision on high risk current non-medical users of psychoactive drug.

648,Prevalence and factors associated with desire for death in patients with advanced disease: results from a Portuguese cross-sectional study,"Background: Desire for death (DFD) within the context of palliative care has become a prominent medical issue and remains the subject of much controversy.; Methods: Cross-sectional study designed to assess the prevalence and associated demographic, physical, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors for DFD in patients with advanced disease.; Results: Seventy-five terminally ill patients were included in the analyses in a 28-month period. The prevalence of DFD was 20% (95% CI [11.7-30.8]). No statistical differences were observed between patients with and without DFD with respect to sex, age, race, education, religion, type of family, medical diagnosis, and medication. There were associations between DFD and being married/cohabitating (OR = 4.0; 95% CI [1.21-13.29]) and being socially isolated (OR = 0.3; 95% CI [0.06-0.98]). Significant positive correlations were found between moderate to severe Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) scores and DFD for tiredness (OR = 10.1; 95% CI [1.57 Â± inf]) and drowsiness (OR = 6.0; 95% CI [1.77-20.37]). DFD was also correlated with depression (DSM-IV criteria: OR = 5.5; 95% CI [1.56-19.47]; Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) depression subscale â‰¥11: OR = 8.6; 95% CI [1.33 Â± inf]). In exact multivariate regression analyses predicting DFD, three independent factors emerged: marital status (OR = 5.3; 95% CI [1.16-29.89]); HADS depression sub-scale score â‰¥11 (OR = 8.3; 95% CI [1.11 Â± inf]); drowsiness (OR = 5.8; 95% CI [1.29-32.85]).; Discussion: Prevalence of DFD was high in this sample of patients.

649,Adolescent health and subsequent risk of self-harm hospitalisation: a 15-year follow-up of the Young-HUNT cohort,"Background: Self-harm is associated with increased suicide risk, and constitutes a major challenge in adolescent mental healthcare. In the current study, we examined the association between different aspects of adolescent health and risk of later self-harm requiring hospital admission.; Methods: We linked baseline information from 13 to 19Â year old participants (nÂ =Â 8965) in the Norwegian Young-HUNT 1 study to patient records of self-harm hospitalisation during 15Â years of follow-up. We used Cox regression to estimate risk factor hazard ratios (HR).; Results: Eighty-nine persons (71% female) were admitted to hospital because of self-harm. Intoxication/self-poisoning was the most frequent method (81%). Both mental (anxiety/depression, loneliness, being bullied) and somatic (epilepsy, migraine) health issues were associated with up to fourfold increased risk of self-harm-related hospital admission.; Conclusions: Several health issues during adolescence markedly increased the risk of later self-harm hospitalisation. Current findings should be incorporated in the strive to reduce self-harming and attempted suicides among young people.; Adolescence, Hospitalisation, Self-harm","Junker, AsbjÃ¸rn; BjÃ¸rngaard, Johan HÃ¥kon & Bjerkeset, Ottar",1,649
650,"Sleep problems and hospitalization for self-harm: A 15-year follow-up of 9,000 Norwegian adolescents: The Young-HUNT study","Objectives: To investigate the association between sleeping problems in adolescence and subsequent hospital admission for self-harm (SH). Design: Prospective cohort study, linking health survey information on sleep problems to hospital-based patient records. Setting: Residents of Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag County, Norway, aged 13-19 years in 1995-97. Patients or Participants: 10,202 adolescents were invited to participate in the Young-HUNT study; 8,983 (88%) completed the health survey. Measurements and Results: 10% of participants reported difficulties initiating sleep, 4% reported early morning wakening. Ninety-eight participants (27% male) were hospitalized following SH over a mean 12 years follow-up. Difficulties initiating sleep/early morning wakening were associated with increased risk of SH (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.29-3.46, sex- and age-adjusted) compared with no problems, yet coexistent symptoms of combined anxiety/depression explained most of the association with sleep problems (fully adjusted HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.66-2.16). The HR of combined difficulties initiating sleep/early morning wakening differed in those with and without anxiety/depression at baseline (P interaction = 0.03); among those without caseness symptoms of anxiety/depression it was 5.58 (95% CI 2.02-15.40), while in those with caseness symptoms of anxiety/ depression it was 0.82 (95% CI 0.19-3.44). Conclusions: Sleep problems are common among Norwegian adolescents. The strong association between sleep problems and subsequent hospitalization for self-harm could mainly be related to coexistent symptoms of anxiety and depression. Prevention of adolescent sleep problems, anxiety and depression should be targeted when seeking to reduce and prevent self-harm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

651,Prednisolone suppression test in depression: Prospective study of the role of HPA axis dysfunction in treatment resistance,"Background: People with severe depressive illness have raised levels of cortisol and reduced glucocorticoid receptor function. Aims: To obtain a physiological assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis feedback status in an in-patient sample with depression and to relate this to prospectively determined severe treatment resistance. Method: The prednisolone suppression test was administered to 45 in-patients with depression assessed as resistant to two or more antidepressants and to 46 controls, prior to intensive multimodal in-patient treatment. Results: The patient group had higher cortisol levels than controls, although the percentage suppression of cortisol output after prednisolone in comparison with placebo did not differ. Non-response to in-patient treatment was predicted by a more dysfunctional HPA axis (higher cortisol levels post-prednisolone and lower percentage suppression). Conclusions: In patients with severe depression, HPA axis activity is reset at a higher level, although feedback remains intact. However, prospectively determined severe treatment resistance is associated with an impaired feedback response to combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor activation by prednisolone.

652,Alzheimer's disease in a patient with major depression and excellent performance in concise neuropsychological tests,"We present here a case study of a patient was a 63-year old woman with hypertension, otherwise healthy and with no history of depression. She had been a teacher of music, and had retired six years earlier because of hip arthritis. Until summer 2003 she had been functioning well, then her mother died and she began to feel unable to do anything. She begun to suffer from insomnia, lost her appetite, began to express unrealistic fears, and her weight decreased 20 kg in six months. During the autumn her functional capacity declined markedly. She did not prepare any food nor did she take part in any of the household tasks. She was totally hopeless and sometimes also anxious and agitated. Several antidepressants were tried but they did not help. The clinical conclusion was that there were no signs of AD. No brain imaging was thought to be necessary. One month later, the patient jumped from a sixth floor window and died immediately. A neuropathological autopsy was conducted and clear-cut Alzheimer changes in the brain were found, fairly plentiful neuritic plaques on cortices. It is obvious that all patients with subjective memory complaints cannot be examined by modern diagnostic instruments. But it is good to bear in mind that clinical assessment and neuropsychological screening tests do not always reveal very early and atypical cases of AD, especially in people with high education.

He was diagnosed with ASD when he was 4 years old and since that time he was receiving specialized education. He was on risperidone 1.25 mg/day for 4 months, receiving for his irritability, aggression, and hyperactivity. In his family history, son of his aunt had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BPD), and his four cousins were diagnosed with ASD. According to the clinical picture and history of the subject, the authors gave a diagnosis of drug-induced mania and ceased the oral decongestant. One week later, in his second visit, his father reported that his behaviors resolved within 4 days. This case highlights the fact that decongestants may cause manic symptoms. Clinicians should be alert to this possibility in subjects with a personal and/or family history of BPD.

654,Clinically relevant and simple immune system measure is related to symptom burden in bipolar disorder,"Objective: Immunological theories, particularly the sickness syndrome theory, may explain psychopathology in mood disorders. However, no clinical trials have investigated the association between overall immune system markers with a wide range of specific symptoms including potential gender differences. Methods: We included two similar clinical trials, the lithium treatment moderate-dose use study and clinical and health outcomes initiatives in comparative effectiveness for bipolar disorder study, enrolling 765 participants with bipolar disorder. At study entry, white blood cell (WBC) count was measured and psychopathology assessed with the Montgomery and Aasberg depression rating scale (MADRS). We performed analysis of variance and linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the deviation from the median WBC, and multinomial regression analysis between different WBC levels. All analyses were performed gender-specific and adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, race, and somatic diseases. Results: The overall MADRS score increased significantly for each 1.0 Ã— 10â¹/l deviation from the median WBC among 322 men (coefficient = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.32â€“1.89; p = 0.006), but not among 443 women (coefficient = 0.56; 95% CI = âˆ’0.19â€“1.31; p = 0.14). Among men, WBC deviations were associated with increased severity of sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, inability to feel, and suicidal thoughts. Among women, WBC deviations were associated with increased severity of reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic thoughts. Both higher and lower WBC levels were associated with increased severity of several specific symptoms. Conclusion: Immune system alterations were associated with increased severity of specific mood symptoms, particularly among men. Our results support the sickness syndrome theory, but furthermore emphasise the relevance to study immune suppression in bipolar disorder. Due to the explorative nature and cross-sectional design, future studies need to confirm these findings.

655,Sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being in adolescence: a longitudinal study in Switzerland and Norway,"Background: Adolescents' sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being are related. However, few studies have examined the relationship between sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being longitudinally across adolescence - a time of profound biological and psychosocial change. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether shorter sleep duration in adolescents is predictive of lower subjective psychological well-being 6 months and 12 months later or whether lower subjective psychological well-being is predictive of shorter sleep duration.; Methods: Adolescents (age range, 10.02-15.99 years; mean age, 13.05Â±1.49 years; 51.8%, female) from German-speaking Switzerland (n=886) and Norway (n=715) reported their sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being on school days using self-rating questionnaires at baseline (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months from baseline (T3).; Results: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed that sleep duration decreased with age. Longer sleep duration was concurrently associated with better subjective psychological well-being. Crossed-lagged autoregressive longitudinal panel analysis showed that sleep duration prospectively predicted subjective psychological well-being while there was no evidence for the reverse relationship.; Conclusion: Sleep duration is predictive of subjective psychological well-being.

656,Suicidal ideation in elderly Korean population: A two-year longitudinal study,"Background: This study aimed to assess the prevalence, incidence, and persistence of suicidal ideation (SI), and to investigate the psychosocial factors associated with these. Methods: A total of 1,204 community dwelling elderly adults aged 65 years or older were evaluated at baseline, 909 (75%) of whom were followed two years later. The presence of SI was identified using the questions from the community version of the Geriatric Mental State (GMS) diagnostic schedule (GMS B3) at both baseline and follow-up interviews. Baseline measures included demographic status, years of education, rural/urban residence, accommodation, past and current occupation, monthly income, marital status, stressful life events, social support deficits, number of physical illnesses, severity of pain, physical activity, disability, depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, cognitive function, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Results: Baseline SI prevalence, follow-up incidence (SI rate at follow-up of 805 elderly subjects who did not have SI at baseline), and persistence (SI rate at follow-up of 104 elderly subjects who had SI at baseline) were 11.5%, 9.6%, and 36.5%, respectively. Baseline SI was independently associated with no current employment, lower monthly income, stressful life events, more severe pain, presence of disability, depressive symptoms, and smoking. Incident SI was independently predicted by baseline unmarried status, social support deficit, severe pain, presence of depressive symptoms, and smoking. Persistent SI was independently predicted by baseline stressful life events and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were independently associated with prevalent, incident, and persistent SI, but other predictors varied according to incidence and persistence outcomes.

657,The relationship between shift work and mental health among electronics workers in South Korea: A cross-sectional study,"Objective: To determine the relationship between shift work and mental health, particularly insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation, among electronics production workers.; Methods: A survey was conducted with 14,226 workers from an electronics manufacturer in South Korea. After excluding 112 individuals with incomplete responses, 14,114 respondents were analyzed. As part of a larger project, we collected data on respondents' general characteristics, work-related characteristics, and health status; however, in this study, we focused on the data related to shift work and mental health. Insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation were set as dependent variables and working schedule as set as the independent variable. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis with daytime workers as the reference group. The model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, workplace, educational level, and marital status with or without children under 6 years of age.; Results: Relative to daytime workers, shift workers had 2.35, 1.23, and 1.17 greater odds of insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation, respectively. Within the shift worker group, we found that the odds of depression and suicidal ideation increased dramatically when respondents had insomnia. The ORs for depression and suicidal ideation were 4.899 and 7.934, respectively.; Conclusions: Our findings suggest that shift work is related to an increased risk of mental health problems in production workers, and the sleep disturbance related with shift work is a central mechanism for this relationship. Since these results suggest that proactive management of sleep problems might attenuate their detrimental effects on shift worker's mental health.; Electronics*, Mental Health*, Occupations*, Work Schedule Tolerance/*psychology, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Republic of Korea","Kang, Mo-Yeol; Kwon, Ho-Jang; Choi, Kyung-Hwa; Kang, Chung-Won & Kim, Hyunjoo",0,657

This study included 19 suicide attempters with MDD and 19 non-suicide attempters with MDD. RSFC was compared between the two groups and the regression analyses were conducted to identify the correlation between RSFC and Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) scores in the suicide attempt group. Statistical significance was set at p-value (uncorrected) <0.005 with k â‰¥ 28 voxels. Compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters showed significantly increased RSFC of the left amygdala with the right insula and left superior orbitofrontal area, and increased RSFC of the right amygdala with the left middle temporal area. The regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the SSI total score and RSFC of the right amygdala with the right parahippocampal area in the suicide attempt group. The present RSFC findings provide evidence of a functional neural basis and will help reveal the pathophysiology underlying suicidality in subjects with MDD.

659,Associations between sleep disturbance and suicidal ideation in adolescents admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit,"The goals of our study were to: 1) describe the incidence of disturbances in sleep quality, sleep hygiene, sleep-related cognitions and nightmares; and 2) investigate the association between these sleep-related disturbances and suicidal ideation (SI), in adolescents admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit. Our sample consisted of 50 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 years (32 females and 18 males; 41 Caucasian and nine African American). Our cross-sectional design involved the administration of the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS), the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-Short version for use with children (DBAS-C10), the Disturbing Dreams and Nightmare Scale (DDNSI), and the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Jr (SIQ-JR). Analyses were conducted using Pearson correlations, as well as univariate and multivariate regression. Results indicated that our sample experienced sleep disturbances and SI to a greater degree than non-clinical samples. Sleep quality was correlated with nightmares, while sleep quality and nightmares were each correlated with SI. Sleep quality, dysfunctional beliefs, and nightmares each independently predicted SI. Our study was the first to use the four sleep measures with an adolescent psychiatric inpatient sample. It is important to develop sleep-related assessment tools in high-risk populations given the link between sleep disturbances and suicidality. Furthermore, a better understanding of the relationships between SI and sleep quality, sleep-related cognitions, and nightmares is needed to develop potential prevention and treatment options for suicidality in adolescents.

In Arab community studies, the prevalence of lifetime suicide ideation varied from a low of 2.09% to a high of 13.9% and the lifetime prevalence of attempts from 0.72% to 6.3%. In about all community studies which assessed lifetime and 12 months suicide, ideation was significantly related to being a female. Twelve month suicide ideation was significantly related to depressive symptoms and experiencing more life events, illnesses and using more tranquilizers/sleeping pills. One month suicide ideation was related to non-married status, not having children and a history of psychiatric disorders, specifically MDD, dysthymia, agoraphobia, OCD and GAD. When compared to female university students, females who were displaced or refugees were significantly more likely to report suicide ideation (within the 'past few weeks'). In conclusion, national epidemiological studies are needed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behaviors in the Arab World.

662,Family characteristics and behavior problems of suicidal and non-suicidal children and adolescents,"Examined familial and individual variables in youngsters at high risk for suicide and non-suicidal youngsters. 100 6â€“17 yr old inpatients completed a battery of questionnaires including, FACES II, Family Strengths, and Problem Behavior Scales, to assess family dysfunction and individual behavior problems. The results indicated that suicidal Ss have lower pride in their families and perceived them as less adaptable than non-suicidal Ss as indicated by scores on the Family Strengths and FACES II, respectively. Scores on the Problem Behavior Scales indicated that suicidal Ss also exhibited self-inflicted behaviors, withdrawal from others, little interest in activities, poor concentration, and difficulties with sleeping. In addition, Ss at risk for suicide were more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder, including major depressive disorder and dysthymia, as well as substance abuse and phobias. These findings suggest that suicidal Ss' negative perceptions of their families and their maladaptive behaviors should be given special attention in designing appropriate interventions. In this way, treatment would likely be effective by providing appropriate coping skills and preventing future suicidal attempts in high risk youngsters.

663,A case for imaging in high-risk psychosis: Insular pathology in first episode psychosis,"Presents a case report of a 16-year-old male presented with 12 months of worsening referential delusions, thought broadcasting, thought insertion, third-person auditory hallucinations and olfactory hallucinations â€“ satisfying criteria for schizophrenia. He also had dysthymia and suicidal thoughts from age 11. There was no prior community psychiatric involvement. Five second degree relatives had schizophrenia, one had suicided. There was no known family history of cerebral tumors. Physical examination, serological investigation and sleep deprived electroencephalogram were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right insular cortex mass. The consulted neurosurgeon opined the likely low grade dysembryoplastic neuroepithilial tumors would remain relatively static and recommended surveillance monitoring. Depressive symptoms completely remitted on fluoxetine 40 mg/day. Psychotic symptoms did not respond to 8 weeks of risperidone 6 mg/day so the patient was transferred to an inpatient unit. Risperidone was switched to aripiprazole 30 mg/day, with subsequent transition to aripiprazole depot 400 mg monthly. Psychotic symptoms partially remitted, with full resolution of suicidal and homicidal ideation prior to discharge.

Criteria for treatment included 3 of the 4 following symptoms: irritability, sleep disturbance, aggressive or self-injurious behavior, and behavioral cycling. Medications prescribed at the time of enrollment, including neuroleptics and phenobarbitals, were usually discontinued. 18 patients completed the study. 14 patients (78%) responded favorably to treatment and were maintained on valproic acid for the 2 yrs of the study. A history of epilepsy or a suspicion of seizures was strongly associated with a favorable response to valproic acid.

666,"Insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicide ideation in Japanese white-collar employees","Background: Although poor sleep quality is the most common subjective complaint of workers and is a risk factor for depressive symptoms and suicide, researchers have not yet provided definitive links between insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicide. Purpose: In our mediation model, we hypothesized relationships among insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicide ideation. The purpose here was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our mediation model. Method: Three hundred forty-three Japanese full-time white-collar workers completed the measures to assess insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicide ideation over an approximately 3-month period. Results: A SEM analysis revealed that insomnia symptoms were positively and significantly associated with depressive symptoms, and depressive symptoms were positively and significantly associated with suicide ideation. Two tests showed a significant indirect effect of insomnia symptoms on suicide ideation through depressive symptoms. Thus, these results supported our mediation model. Conclusion: We conclude that insomnia symptoms were positively associated with suicidal ideation, though this relation was accounted for by depressive symptoms in Japanese white-collar workers.

667,Detecting and managing depression in older people,"Indicates that depression in older people is not only common but carries greater risks than when it occurs earlier in life. Elderly people are less likely to express the overt depressed mood necessary for major depression to be diagnosed, and they are also less likely to express suicidal ideation despite their increased risk of actual suicide. They are, however, more likely to complain of intractable physical symptoms with no apparent physical cause, to have intractable sleep disturbance, and to show prominent psychomotor agitation. It is discussed why treatment is seldom given to manage depression in the elderly. Encouraging the use of screening questionnaires may be helpful both in increasing general practitioner awareness of depression and also in highlighting individuals with clinically significant symptoms. The options available for acute management are presented.

668,Lifetime suicide attempt in bipolar I disorder: Its correlates and effect on illness course,"Objectives: To identify the prevalence and correlates of bipolar I patients with a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Materials and methods: Bipolar I disorder was diagnosed in 150 patients as per DSM-IV-TR criteria. Their lifetime suicide risk was assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. NIMH retrospective Life Chart Methodology was used to chart the illness course. Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess the recent adherence and subjective sleep quality, respectively. The suicide attempters were compared with non-attempters on individual variables. Results: Around 23% had a positive lifetime history of suicide attempt. They were predominantly female, had an index (first ever) episode of depression, spent more proportion of time being ill, especially in depressive or mixed episode phase. Comorbid substance use disorder along with suicidal attempts was seen only in males. Suicide attempters displayed poor medication adherence attitudes for medications taken during the past week and reported impaired sleep quality for the previous month. Conclusions: A positive history of lifetime suicide attempt was significantly associated with a worse course of bipolar I disorder. Effective treatment of depressive episodes, addressing non-adherence, substance use and sleep problems can reduce the suicide risk in such patients. Retrospective design of the study and recall bias are some of the limitations.

670,Early symptom change prediction of remission in depression treatment,"Objectives: This study investigated hypothesized early symptom changes as differential predictors of long-term remission for duloxetine and escitalopram.; Experimental Design: This was a post-hoc analysis from a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of patients with major depressive disorder treated for 8 weeks with duloxetine 60 mg/day (N = 273) or escitalopram 10 mg/day (N = 274), and for another 6 months with duloxetine up to 120 mg/day or escitalopram up to 20 mg/day. Odds ratios (ORs) for successful treatment (sustained remission), defined as a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) score </= 7 over 8 months, were determined for improvement in HAMD-17 depressed mood, retardation, and anxiety symptom factor subscales (20% decrease), along with associated positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs).; Principal Observations: For both drugs, 2-week HAMD-17 improvement on all symptom subscales (except sleep for duloxetine) significantly predicted remission with ORs > 2.0. In a follow-up analysis, specific subscale items for psychological anxiety, motor retardation, and suicidality significantly predicted remission for duloxetine, and psychological and somatic anxiety for escitalopram. Notably, high NPVs on the Maier subscale indicated that a lack of 20% improvement on the core"" depression factor by Week 2 was highly predictive of unsuccessful treatment outcome over 8 months.; Conclusions: In accord with hypotheses early symptom changes were specific to treatment with early response in the core depression factor (Maier subscale) anxiety and motor activity for duloxetine and core factor and anxiety for escitalopram. Lack of early response in depression symptom subscales was highly predictive of lack of sustained remission.;""Accession Number: 19204654. Language: English. Date Revised: 20151119.

This study examined the association between sleep apnea and psychopathology and mental health service utilization in a US nationally-representative sample.; Design: National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).; Setting: United States.; Participants: We used data on 264,653 individuals who participated in the 2008-2014 waves of the NSDUH, of which 5498 (3.3%) reported having sleep apnea within the past year.; Intervention: Not applicable.; Measurements: Based on NSDUH responses, participants were categorized as having depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, and serious psychological distress within the past year. Analyses consisted of using logistic regression models with sleep apnea as the main predictor and mental health conditions as the outcomes of interest, controlling for potential confounding variables.; Results: Compared with those without sleep apnea, those reporting past-year sleep apnea had 3.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.77-3.50) times increased odds of having depression, 2.75 (95% CI, 2.34-3.23) times increased odds of suicidal ideation, 3.68 (95% CI, 3.30-4.10) times increased odds of anxiety, and 2.88 (95% CI, 2.61-3.17) times increased odds of severe psychological distress, after controlling for confounders. Among those with each psychiatric outcome, individuals with sleep apnea were substantially more likely to report unmet need for mental health care, despite reporting greater mental health service use.; Conclusions: Individuals with sleep apnea have increased risk for psychopathology, including suicidal ideation.

672,Maternal depression and filicide--Case study of ten mothers,"This study describes ten cases of filicides committed by mothers who intentionally killed one or more of their children within 12 months after delivery. The data were collected from police and court records, forensic psychiatric records, autopsy reports, and other medical records. The mean age of the mothers was 28.5 years and of the victims 4 months. The symptoms of depression were clear: an irritable, severely depressed mood with crying spells, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, preoccupation with worries about the baby's well-being and the mother's caring abilities, suicidal ideation, or even psychotic thoughts. Most mothers had had house calls from the public health nurse or psychologist. The mothers' conditions deteriorated rapidly, and the filicide was committed when the mother was left alone with the baby against her will. The babies were well taken care of, not neglected or abused. The majority of the mothers had felt that their own parents, especially their mothers, were very demanding, rejecting, and emotionally unsupportive. All the mothers had also had traumatic experiences in their childhood or in adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

673,Insomnia is associated with suicide attempt in middle-aged and older adults with depression,"Background: Insomnia increases in prevalence with age, is strongly associated with depression, and has been identified as a risk factor for suicide in several studies. The aim of this study was to determine whether insomnia severity varies between those who have attempted suicide (n = 72), those who only contemplate suicide (n = 28), and those who are depressed but have no suicidal ideation or attempt history (n = 35). Methods: Participants were middle-aged and older adults (age 44â€“87, M = 66 years) with depression. Insomnia severity was measured as the sum of the early, middle, and late insomnia items from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. General linear models examined relations between group status as the independent variable and insomnia severity as the dependent variable. Results: The suicide attempt group suffered from more severe insomnia than the suicidal ideation and non-suicidal depressed groups (p < 0.05). Differences remained after adjusting for potential confounders including demographics, cognitive ability, alcohol dependence in the past month, severity of depressed mood, anxiety, and physical health burden. Moreover, greater insomnia severity in the suicide attempt group could not be explained by interpersonal difficulties, executive functioning, benzodiazepine use, or by the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions: Our results suggest that insomnia may be more strongly associated with suicidal behavior than with the presence of suicidal thoughts alone. Accordingly, insomnia is a potential treatment target for reducing suicide risk in middle-aged and older adults.

674,"Sleep problems and suicide risk in youth: A systematic review, developmental framework, and implications for hospital treatment","OBJECTIVE: Sleep problems are transdiagnostic symptoms that confer significant risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in adults. However, less is known about the sleep-STB association in adolescenceâ€”a developmental period when rates of STBs increase drastically, and sleep problems may be particularly pernicious. This article provides a systematic review of research on the sleep-STB association in youth, an overview of changes in sleep regulation during adolescence that may make sleep problems particularly detrimental for youth, and a discussion of the clinical implications of the sleep-STB association for hospitalized youth. METHOD: The systematic review included all longitudinal studies in which sleep problems were examined as prospective predictors of STBs in adolescents (aged 10â€“24/years). The search was conducted on December 1, 2017 using PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. RESULTS: Ten studies qualified for inclusion in this review. Of these, seven studies found at least one type of sleep problem significantly predicted a STB outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Although findings are mixed, growing research suggests that sleep problems may be a unique risk factor for STBs in youth. Sleep problems may be particularly important intervention target because they are easily assessed across healthcare settings and are amenable to treatment.

675,Bipolar depression: A new role for atypical antipsychotics?,"Bipolar depression, the most common phase of bipolar disorder, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional drugs such as lithium, lamotrigine or antidepressants each offer some clinical efficacy; however, efficacy can be limited and side effects are sometimes problematic. Thus there is a major unmet need for effective, well-tolerated agents for the treatment of bipolar depression. The atypical antipsychotics, with their proven efficacy against manic symptoms, are emerging as candidates for use against the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Several studies have shown that some atypicals improve depressive symptoms in mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder; however, few studies have been performed in patients specifically with bipolar depressive episodes. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute bipolar I depression, olanzapine monotherapy and an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination significantly improved Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) with corresponding effect sizes (improvement of active treatment over placebo divided by pooled standard deviation) of 0.32 and 0.68, respectively. Importantly, there were no significant differences in rates of switch into mania among the three groups. Recent results from an 8-week, randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with bipolar I and II disorder who were experiencing a bipolar depressive episode showed that quetiapine (300 and 600 mg/day) had significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo in improving the core symptoms of depression, including suicidal thoughts. Quetiapine significantly improved MADRS total scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001); effect sizes (improvement of quetiapine over placebo divided by pooled standard deviation) of 0.66 and 0.80 for 300 and 600 mg/day quetiapine, respectively, were observed. Both doses of quetiapine significantly improved symptoms of anxiety, sleep quality and global quality of life (all, p < 0.001 versus placebo). These initial findings suggest that atypical antipsychotics may prove to be important future treatments for patients with bipolar depression.

676,Suicidal ideation and the subjective aspects of depression,"Background: Suicidal ideation is common in depression, but only moderately related to depression severity - in part because certain clusters of symptoms, such as those related to core mood disturbance, have a differential relationship to suicidal thinking.; Methods: 400 medication free participants with current major depression were assessed with either or both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, n=396) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, n=366), and the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI). Depression rating scales were decomposed into symptoms clusters previously reported (Grunebaum et al., 2005), in order to evaluate their association to suicidal thinking.; Results: Correlations between overall depression severity ratings and the measure of suicidal ideation were modest, and reduced when specific items assessing suicidal thinking on these depression scales were removed. Symptom clusters assessing Psychic Depression (HDRS), Subjective Depression (BDI), and Self-Blame (BDI) were the strongest correlates of suicidal ideation; other somatic and vegetative symptoms had little or no association to suicidal ideation. Severity of these symptom clusters effectively discriminated those with (SSI>0) and without (SSI=0) ideation; severity of these symptom clusters was less strongly associated with the severity of ideation once ideation was present.; Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study, and the dynamic relationship between changes in the severity of various depressive symptoms and change in suicidal thinking remains to be explored.; Conclusions: Depression severity is moderately associated with suicidal ideation, and accounted for primarily by core mood disturbance symptoms and self-punitive thinking. These associations may explain why suicide risk might remain high during treatment even though somatic and vegetative symptoms improve.; Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The titles for Figures 2 and 3 are incorrect. The correct title for Figure 2 is Profiles of Average Levels for Each of the 12 Depressive Symptoms From the Between-Persons Sample and the correct title for Figure 3 is Profiles of the Average Depressive Symptom Deviations for Each of the Nine Adverse Life Event Categories From the Within-Persons Sample."" Also in the second paragraph of the Results section the information regarding the online supplemental figure is incorrect. The sentences in that passage should read ""The mean levels of feeling blue fatigue and appetite loss were especially variable (Figure 2). Anhedonia was elevated after deaths and romantic losses and was lowest after stress and failures.""] Objective: The authors sought to determine whether in a general population sample different categories of adverse life events were associated with different patterns of depressive symptoms. Method: A total of 4856 individuals (53% female) who experienced depressive symptoms in the previous year were assessed in up to four waves over a maximum of 12 years. At each wave participants reported the severity of 12 symptoms disaggregated from the nine DSM-III-R criteria for major depression and the self-identified cause of these symptoms which were classified into nine categories of adverse life events. Results: The patterns of depressive symptoms associated with the nine categories of adverse life events differed significantly. Deaths of loved ones and romantic breakups were marked by high levels of sadness anhedonia appetite loss and (for romantic breakups) guilt. Chronic stress and to a lesser degree failures were associated with fatigue and hypersomnia but less so with sadness anhedonia and appetite loss. Those who reported that no adverse life events caused their dysphoric episodes reported fatigue appetite gain and thoughts of self-harm but less sadness or trouble concentrating. These symptom patterns were found in a between-persons analysis of participants who had a single dysphoric episode and they were replicated in an independent within-persons analysis of episode-specific symptom deviations among individuals with multiple episodes. Similar results were obtained when the sample was restricted to those meeting DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for major depression. Conclusions: Depression is a pathoplastic syndrome. Different types of life events are related to different depressive symptom profiles. The results from the within-persons analysis suggest that these relationships are causal.

The goal of the current study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of prescription opioid and sedative misuse among veterans wounded in combat.; Method: We recruited veterans from the Combat Wounded Coalition (nâ€¯=â€¯212; 84% non-Hispanic White; 97.6% male) to complete an online survey of mental health and substance use disorder symptoms, assessed via the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptoms Measure, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5, the Pain Enjoyment General Activity Scale, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Prescription opioid and sedative misuse was assessed by frequency of use in the past year that was not currently prescribed or using more than prescribed.; Results: Participants reported high rates of past year prescription opioid misuse (46.2%) and sedative misuse (21.7%). Misuse of both opioids and sedatives was associated with the most distress, including greater depression, anger, sleep disturbance, AUDIT scores, PTSD symptoms, suicidality, and pain interference. In multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses, greater sleep disturbance (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.73) was associated with greater odds of sedative misuse versus no misuse. Higher AUDIT scores were associated with greater risk of sedative misuse (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.16) versus opioid misuse only.; Conclusions: Military veterans wounded in combat have high rates of prescription opioid misuse and sedative misuse. Sleep problems and AUDIT scores might help identify veterans who are at most risk for opioid and sedative misuse.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

679,"More than military sexual trauma: Interpersonal violence, PTSD, and mental health in women veterans","Military sexual trauma (MST) is reported by 20-40% of female veterans. The purpose of this study of female veterans referred for MST treatment was to examine the relationships between lifetime trauma (physical, sexual, and psychological) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, physical health, and quality of life using retrospective cross-sectional data from medical records. Of the 135 participants, 95.4% reported at least one trauma in addition to MST, most notably sexual abuse as adult civilians (77.0%) and as children (52.6%). PTSD, depression, and sleep difficulty rates were clinically significant. Chronic pain (66.4%) was associated with childhood abuse, physical health, sleep difficulties, and coping. Integrating mental and physical health treatment is necessary to treat MST and PTSD in female veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

681,The health effects of childhood abuse: four pathways by which abuse can influence health,"Objectives: This article describes four possible pathways by which childhood abuse relates to health problems in adults.; Method: Literature on the long-term effects of childhood abuse is organized in a health psychology framework describing behavioral, social, cognitive, and emotional pathways. Key studies from the health psychology and behavioral medicine literature are included to demonstrate how these pathways relate to health.; Results: Childhood abuse puts people at risk of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, participating in harmful activities, having difficulties in relationships, and having negative beliefs and attitudes towards others. Each of these increases the likelihood of health problems, and they are highly related to each other.; Conclusions: Childhood abuse is related to health via a complex matrix of behavioral, emotional, social, and cognitive factors. Health outcomes for adult survivors are unlikely to improve until each of these factors is addressed.;Health Behavior*, Child Abuse/*psychology, Child, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Feeding and Eating Disorders/psychology, Humans, Sexual Behavior/psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology, Social Support, Substance-Related Disorders/psychology, Suicide/psychology","Kendall-Tackett, Kathleen",0,681
682,A systematic review of the psychiatric side-effects of efavirenz,"Concerns regarding the use of efavirenz in patients with a history of mental illness may predispose clinicians to not offer this agent to psychiatrically ill populations in spite of the convenience of once daily dosing, which can result in improved adherence in these at-risk populations. This systematic review examines the current data regarding the neuropsychiatric effects of efavirenz, and also attempts to provide guidance to clinicians using efavirenz to treat patients with mental illness. The review identified high rates of neuropsychiatric side effects including vivid dreams, insomnia and mood changes in approximately 50% of patients who initiate efavirenz. The effects begin quickly, commonly peak in the first 2 weeks, and are generally mild and transient in nature. Isolated case reports and uncontrolled data suggest higher rates of severe side effects; however, there is no clear evidence of a broadly increased risk of suicide or dangerous behavior for patients taking efavirenz as part of their antiretroviral regimen.

683,Suicide by self-strangulation whilst under observation,"Two cases are reported of individuals who committed suicide after they had been identified as being acutely at risk of killing themselves. Self-strangulation by a ligature fashioned from the subjects' clothes was the mechanism of suicide in both cases. One death occurred in a police station and the other on an acute psychiatric ward. These cases highlight the need for those formulating policies concerning the supervision of the suicidal individual to pay attention to the minutiae of detail. In particular, a case is made for those at risk of suicide to be prevented from sleeping with their head covered by blankets.; Airway Obstruction*, Suicide/*prevention & control, Adult, Bedding and Linens, England, Humans, Male, Prisons/organization & administration, Psychiatric Department, Hospital/organization & administration, Risk Management","Kennedy, N.

684,Reliability of self-report of health in juvenile offenders,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of self-reports of juvenile offenders on physical factors (e.g. sleep difficulties, weight-related behaviours and weight perceptions), health risk behaviours (e.g. alcohol use), trauma history (e.g. physical and sexual abuse) and psychological factors (e.g. anxiety, suicidal and self-harm behaviours). Self-reports obtained via a Health Questionnaire from 242 incarcerated juvenile offenders were compared with standardized measures (body mass index, Adolescent Psychopathology Scale and Child Trauma Questionnaire) to investigate the reliability (via construct validity) and veracity of their self-report. Using kappa estimates and receiver-operating characteristic curves, results generally showed high agreement across measures, suggesting that self-report questions from the health survey could all be used reliably. The degree of accuracy indicated that young offenders are as reliable as clinical and community samples of adolescents in their self-report. These findings have implications for routine assessments and practice evaluations that rely on self-report as the method of data collection and as the basis for clinical formulation and treatment planning.

686,Assessment of sleep quality in bipolar euthymic patients,"Objective: Sleep quality is affected in bipolar disorder even in euthymic episodes. The aim of this study was to assess sleep quality in bipolar euthymic patients, determine related clinical characteristics and evaluate its effects on functionality. Methods: A total of 122 outpatients were included. Scales were used to confirm that patients were euthymic. Mini Mental Test was performed to exclude patients with a diagnosis of dementia. A data form for socio-demographic features and clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder have been completed. SCID-I and SCID II were used. The general features of sleep were investigated by General Sleep Questionnaire. All patients completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Bipolar Disorder Functioning Questionnaire. Results: 56.5% of our sample had poor sleep quality. Patients with poor sleep had a longer time to fall asleep and more frequent waking after sleep onset. Caffeine use and smoking, history of suicide attempts, seasonality, comorbidity of lifetime anxiety, somatoform and impulse control disorders, using antidepressant medication and administration of electroconvulsive therapy were significantly higher; emotional and intellectual functioning, household relations, taking initiative, self-sufficiency and total functionality were lower in bipolar patients with poor sleep quality (p<0.05). The strongest predictor of sleep quality problem was seasonality, recording an odds ratio of 3.91. Conclusions: Sleep quality is closely related with clinical features of bipolar disorder. Sleep quality is affected negatively in euthymic episodes of bipolar disorder and poor sleep quality cause loss in functionality. Assessment of sleep disturbances routinely in psychiatric interviews and dealing with sleep problems regardless mood episodes may improve sleep quality, thereby functionality and quality of life.

687,The epidemiology of DSM-III-R bipolar I disorder in a general population survey,"Background: Data are presented on the general population epidemiology of DSM-III-R bipolar I disorder in the United States.; Methods: Data come from the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a general population survey of DSM-III-R disorders. A modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to make diagnoses.; Results: A small (N = 59) clinical reappraisal study showed that the only manic symptom profile that could validly be assessed with the CIDI is characterized by euphoria, grandiosity and the ability to maintain energy without sleep, which described approximately half of all clinically validated bipolar I cases in the NCS. Further analysis focused on this symptom profile, which involved N = 29 cases in the total sample. Lifetime prevalence was estimated to be 0.4% and 12-month prevalence only slightly lower. Caseness was negatively related to income, education and age, positively related to urbanicity, and elevated among the previously married, never married and non-whites. All cases reported at least one other NCS/DSM-III-R disorder and 59.3% reported that their episode of bipolar disorder (either mania or depression) occurred at a later age than at least one other NCS/DSM-III-R disorder. Although 93.2% of lifetime cases reported some lifetime treatment, only 44.7% of recent cases were in treatment.; Conclusions: The type of bipolar disorder examined here is highly chronic, co-morbid and impairing. Increased efforts are required to attract current cases into appropriate treatment. Methodological research is needed to develop more accurate measures of other bipolar symptom profiles for use in general population epidemiological studies.;Bipolar Disorder/*epidemiology, Age of Onset, Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology, Behavioral Symptoms/epidemiology, Chi-Square Distribution, Comorbidity, Confidence Intervals, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Odds Ratio, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Prevalence, Retrospective Studies, Socioeconomic Factors, Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology, Suicide/psychology, Suicide/statistics & numerical data, Survival Analysis, United States/epidemiology","Kessler, R C; Rubinow, D R; Holmes, C; Abelson, J M & Zhao, S",0,687
688,Diagnostic validity and factor analysis of Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale in Parkinson disease population,"Background: The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is commonly used to assess major depression in Parkinson disease (PD), but studies on its utility are few. This study examines the validity and factor structure of MADRS in population with PD. Methods: In 104 patients with idiopathic PD, major depression was diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision; DSM-IV-TR) criteria, and all patients were rated by MADRS. Results: The MADRS showed good concurrent validity with DSM-IV-TR criteria. The diagnostic cutoff was established as 16/17 (sensitivity 97.43, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 98.48%). Factor analysis identified 3 factors, accounting for 76% of total variance: 'sadness-anhedonia' comprising apparent sadness, reported sadness, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal ideas; 'anxiety' with reduced sleep and inner tension; and 'vegetative symptoms' with reduced appetite. Conclusion: The MADRS has diagnostic utility in major depression in PD. The 3-factor structure of MADRS may help to understand the different dimensions of major depression and identify distinct symptom subgroups in this population.

689,Long-term safety and efficacy of armodafinil in bipolar depression: A 6-month open-label extension study,"Background: Safe/well-tolerated treatments for bipolar I depression remain limited. We assessed safety/tolerability of adjunctive open-label armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent evaluated in 3 acute, controlled efficacy studies with variable efficacy results. Methods: Completers of three 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled adjunctive armodafinil studies (150â€“200 mg/day added to ongoing stable maintenance doses of 1 or 2 protocol-defined mood stabilizers) in bipolar I depression could enter this 6-month, open-label extension study. Objectives included evaluation of safety/tolerability (primary) and efficacy (secondary). Results: 867 patients enrolled; 863 received â‰¥1 dose of armodafinil and 506 (58%) completed the 6-month study. Headache, insomnia, and anxiety were the most common adverse events (AEs) reported, whereas akathisia, nausea, sedation/somnolence, and weight increase were uncommon. Mean measures assessing emergence of mania, anxiety, insomnia, or suicidality showed no worsening. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 57 (7%) patients. Serious AEs occurred in 27 (3%) patients and were considered treatment-related in 8 (1%) patients. Depressive symptoms improved over the 6 months, as did patient functioning. Limitations: Lack of placebo control. Conclusions: Adjunctive armodafinil was generally safe and well tolerated over 6 months of open-label treatment at 150â€“200 mg/day when taken with protocol-defined mood stabilizers for bipolar I depression. This 6-month open-label study suggested that armodafinil augmentation of bipolar maintenance therapies may have a favorable risk profile and may improve depressive symptoms in some patients with bipolar I depression.

690,"Is postpartum depression a homogenous disorder: time of onset, severity, symptoms and hopelessness in relation to the course of depression","Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common illness, but due to the underlying processes and the diversity of symptoms, some variability is exhibited. The risk of postpartum depression is great if the mother has previously suffered from depression, but there is some evidence that a certain subgroup of women only experience depression during the postpartum period.; Methods: The study group consisted of 104 mothers with postpartum major depression and a control group of 104 postpartum mothers without depression. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was used for data collection. The severity of depression and other mental symptoms were assessed using several validated rating scales.; Results: A history of past depression (82%), including depression during pregnancy (42%) and during the postpartum period (53%), was very common in those with current PPD. Eighteen per cent of mothers with current PPD had previously not had any depressive episodes and four per cent had experienced depression only during the postpartum period. Therefore, pure PPD was rare. The onset of PPD was usually (84%) within six weeks of childbirth. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, depressed mood, diminished pleasure/interest, decreased energy, and psychomotor agitation/retardation were common with all kinds of depression histories. Pure PPD was the most similar to the first depressive episode. Nevertheless, the severity of depression, the level of hopelessness, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation were lower, appetite changed less, and concentration was better than in other recurrent depressions.; Conclusions: According to this study, PPD is not a homogenous disorder. The time of onset, severity, symptoms, level of hopelessness, and the course of depression vary. Recurrent depression is common. All mothers must be screened during the sixth week postpartum at the latest. Screening alone is not effective; it is also important to give mothers information about PPD and to discuss the symptoms with them in order for them to recognise this disorder and possible new episodes in the future.;Depression/*epidemiology, Depression, Postpartum/*epidemiology, Depressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology, Mothers/*psychology, Postpartum Period/*psychology, Adult, Case-Control Studies, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Suicidal Ideation, Surveys and Questionnaires, Young Adult","Kettunen, Pirjo; Koistinen, Eeva & Hintikka, Jukka",0,690
691,"Prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms in secondary school children in Dhaka city, Bangladesh","Objectives: Depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease, and often starts at a young age. Depression in young people can increase the risk of unhealthy lifestyle behaviour and can lead to substantial disability, social problems, poor health, and suicide. Other research has examined depressive symptoms among adult populations in Bangladesh, but little is known about other age groups. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of depressive symptoms among secondary school children of Dhaka city, Bangladesh.; Design: A self-completed questionnaire was administered to 898 students from eight secondary schools of Dhaka, the capital City of Bangladesh. Of the respondents, 755 (372 males, 383 females; average age 14.26 years; SD 1.15) completed the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10). A score of 10 or more was used to indicate depressive symptoms. Parents completed a separate questionnaire to provide individual and household/family-level data. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was used to assess sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with adolescent depressive symptoms.; Results: Among the responding adolescents, 25% reported depressive symptoms with prevalence more common among females than males (30% vs. 19%). Factors significantly associated with symptoms of depression included being female, aged 15-16 years, self-perception of non-normal weight, feeling unsafe at school, sleep disturbance, low life satisfaction, high intake of sugary drinks, and regularly skipping breakfast.; Conclusion: Depressive symptoms are prevalent among secondary school children in urban Bangladesh. Interventions for adolescents with depressive symptoms could focus on lifestyle practices such as weight management, personal safety, sleep hygiene and healthy eating.; Bangladesh, Depression, adolescent, children, depressive symptoms, mental health, wellbeing","Khan, Asaduzzaman; Ahmed, Rushdia & Burton, Nicola W.",1,691

694,A model to explain suicide by self-immolation among Iranian women: A grounded theory study,"Introduction: Self-immolation is a common method of suicide among Iranian women. There are several contributing motives for attempting self-immolation, and exploration of the process of self-immolation incidents will help interventionists and clinicians develop prevention programs.; Methods: A grounded theory study using face-to-face, recorded interviews was conducted with surviving self-immolated patients (n=14), their close relatives (n=5), and medical staff (n=8) in Kermanshah, Iran. Data were analyzed using constant comparison in open, axial, and selective coding stages.; Results: A conceptual model was developed to explain the relationships among the main categories extracted through the grounded theory study. Family conflicts emerged as the core category. Cultural context of self-immolated patients offered a contextual condition. Other important categories linked to the core category were mental health problems, distinct characteristics of the suicidal method, and self-immolation as a threat. The role of mental health problems as a causal condition was detected in different levels of the self-immolation process. Finally, adverse consequences of self-immolation emerged as having important impact.; Conclusion: The conceptual model, derived through grounded theory study, can guide design of prevention programs. The pivotal role of family conflicts should be emphasized in mental health interventions. The impact of adverse consequences of self-immolation on further suicidal processes necessitates post-suicide prevention programs. Further research to design specific interventions is recommended.; Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

From the context of gene by environment interactions, this manuscript presents a case study of the M family, which experienced 4 committed suicides within a short time period. Over the course of 5 years, the father and 3 sons committed suicide. Suicidal ideations developed in several other members of the family. The family's suicide risk appears to have stemmed from both environmental and genetic factors, and likely from an interactive effect between both. Environmental factors included low level of education, opium dependency among male family members, unemployment, and poverty, and limited access to mental health services. Genotype analyses of A218C polymorphism among surviving family members revealed that all individuals were associated with the gene variation genotypes CC and AC in tryptophan hydroxylase.

697,Pain and risk of completed suicide in Japanese men: A population-based cohort study in Japan (Ohsaki cohort study),"Unrelieved pain is a major factor that influences suicide risk among terminally ill patients, but little is known about the relationship between pain and the risk of completed suicide in the general population. We prospectively examined the association between self-reports of pain and subsequent risk of completed suicide in 26,481 men aged 40 to 79 years from the Ohsaki National Health Insurance Cohort study, a population-based, prospective cohort study initiated in 1994. On the basis of a five-item questionnaire on pain, individuals were classified as having no pain, very mild pain, mild pain, or moderate or severe pain. Completed suicide cases were documented from 1995 to 2001. During 131,027 person-years, 64 completed suicides were documented. After adjustment for covariates, the risk for completed suicide was significantly higher in the subjects with more pain. Multivariate hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) relative to the subjects who had no pain were 1.36 (0.67-2.75), 2.11 (1.02-4.33), and 2.93 (1.34-6.42) in the subjects who had very mild pain, mild pain, and moderate or severe pain, respectively (P for trend = 0.004). Stratified analysis showed that the positive association between pain and suicide risk was robust in the subjects with good health, low stress, adequate sleep, good physical activity, and no history of chronic diseases. Our results suggest that pain is associated with an increased risk of completed suicide among Japanese men. The association was consistently observed among apparently healthy subjects.

698,Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder An overview of research and clinical experience,"Although many studies of RCBD have been reported over the last 2 decades, knowledge remains limited. Higher incidence in women is the sole clearly replicated finding in most studies. This finding might be mediated by cyclothymia, a temperament that is of higher prevalence in women and that might be considered as a normal variant of RC. Many questions remain unanswered. Review of putative risk factors, such as hypothyroidism and treatment with antidepressants, provides no conclusive answers. There is clinical evidence to implicate both factors. In principle, the thyroid connection can be approached rationally, yet there seems to be no relationship between thyroid status and response to thyroid augmentation. For this reason and given the potential risks of long-term thyroid use, this strategy should not be the first one to be tried in RC. Cumulatively, naturalistic studies over the past 30 years have strongly implicated antidepressants in switching and cycle acceleration, yet the double-blind, controlled, prospective studies that are needed to provide definitive answers are unlikely to be conducted for ethical reasons discussed in this article. Bipolar family history of RC probands appears indistinguishable from non-RC probands, indicating that most likely RCBD does not breed true. Although RC seems to be more lithium resistant with less likelihood of being symptom-free after 2 to 5 years of follow-up, many of these patients nonetheless have resolution of the RC course. There is no marked difference in suicide rates. An association of RC with bipolar type II, D-M-I pattern and those who switch into mania or hypomania on antidepressants is a provocative possibility: Antidepressants might introduce RC by first inducing a switch during a depressive episode, creating a D-M-I pattern, a pattern that is poorly responsive to lithium, which eventually degenerates into RC. Again, this sequence might be mediated by the high prevalence of cyclothymia in bipolar II patients. Thus, data from phenomenology, family history, and long-term outcome do not support RC as a separate entity. RC appears to be a temporary complicated phase in the illness, not a stable feature. This was noted by Kraepelin: I think I am convinced that that kind of classification must of necessity wreck on the irregularity of the disease. The kind and duration of the attacks and the intervals by no means remain the same in the individual case but may frequently change, so that the case must be reckoned always to new forms. Data by Gottschalk et al testify to the chaotic mood swings of contemporary bipolar disorder. Moreover RC is seen in other medical diseases, such as epilepsy, in which patients have phases of increase in frequency of episodes (seizures) that become refractory to treatment. Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to understand the complexity of this intriguing phenomenon and to provide better treatments. Algorithms deriving from tertiary research or university-based clinical experience may not generalize to RC or otherwise treatment-resistant bipolar patients seen in more routine practice. Illness severity in RCBD generally precludes double-blind controlled investigations. Meanwhile, clinicians may rely on discontinuing antidepressants, maintaining patients on combined mood stabilizers--of which valproate is probably the most useful--and making judicious use of atypical neuroleptics.

699,"Prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidities, and suicidality in a community population with problematic Internet use","We examined the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of community-dwelling subjects with problematic Internet use (PIU). In an epidemiological survey of mental disorders among Korean adults conducted in 2006, 6510 subjects (aged 18â€“64 years) completed the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders; Diagnostic Interview Schedule exploring pathological gambling; Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 Screener; questionnaire for sleep disturbances; and questionnaire for suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts. Young's Internet Addiction Test was administered to 3212 individuals who had used the Internet within one month before the interviews in order to identify problematic Internet users (cutoff > 39). The prevalence of PIU was 9.3% in the general population of South Korea. Being male, younger, never married, or unemployed were all associated with increased risks of PIU. Significant positive associations were observed between PIU and nicotine use disorders, alcohol use disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, pathological gambling, adult type ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbances, suicide ideas and suicide plans compare to subjects without PIU, after controlling for socio-demographic variables. These findings suggest that careful evaluation and management of such psychiatric disorders is needed for individuals with PIU.

700,"Early initiation of alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and sexual intercourse linked to suicidal ideation and attempts: findings from the 2006 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey","Purpose: This study examined the association between early initiation of problem behaviors (alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and sexual intercourse) and suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), and explored the effect of concurrent participation in these problem behaviors on suicidal behaviors among Korean adolescent males and females.; Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the 2006 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative sample of middle and high school students (32,417 males and 31,467 females) in grades seven through twelve. Bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. Several important covariates, such as age, family living structure, household economic status, academic performance, current alcohol drinking, current cigarette smoking, current butane gas or glue sniffing, perceived body weight, unhealthy weight control behaviors, subjective sleep evaluation, and depressed mood were included in the analyses.; Results: Both male and female preteen initiators of each problem behavior were at greater risk for suicidal behaviors than non-initiators, even after controlling for covariates. More numerous concurrent problematic behaviors were correlated with greater likelihood of seriously considering or attempting suicide among both males and females. This pattern was more clearly observed in preteen than in teen initiators although the former and latter were engaged in the same frequency of problem behavior.; Conclusion: Early initiation of alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and sexual intercourse, particularly among preteens, represented an important predictor of later suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in both genders. Thus, early preventive intervention programs should be developed and may reduce the potential risks for subsequent suicidal behaviors.;Alcohol Drinking/*psychology, Sexual Behavior/*psychology, Smoking/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior/psychology, Adult, Female, Humans, Korea, Male, Time Factors, Young Adult, Alcohol drinking, attempted suicide, cigarette smoking, life experience, sexual intercourse, suicidal ideation","Kim, Dong-Sik & Kim, Hyun-Sun",0,700

Predictors were obtained from administrative data, and additional variables were abstracted from electronic medical chart notes in the year prior to the start of the antidepressant in 5 categories: clinical symptoms and diagnoses, substance use, life stressors, behavioral/ideation measures (e.g., suicide attempts), and treatments received. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess the predictors associated with different antidepressant prescribing, and adjusted relative risk ratios (RRR) were reported.; Results: Of the administrative data-based variables, gender, age, illicit drug abuse or dependence, and number of psychiatric medications in the prior year were significantly associated with antidepressant selection. After adjusting for administrative data-based variables, sleep problems (relative risk ratio [RRR]â€‰=â€‰2.47) or marital issues (RRRâ€‰=â€‰2.64) identified in the charts were significantly associated with prescribing mirtazapine rather than sertraline; however, no other chart-based variables showed a significant association or an association with a large magnitude.Â ; Conclusions: Some chart data-based variables were predictive of antidepressant selection, but we neither found many nor found them highly predictive of antidepressant selection in patients treated for depression.;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depression/*drug therapy, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies","Kim, Hyungjin Myra; Zivin, Kara; Choe, Hae Mi; Stano, Clare M; Ganoczy, Dara; Walters, Heather & Valenstein, Marcia",0,701

In the original article, on page 1563 an author's name was incorrectly listed. Jong-Yeon Park should be Chong Yon Park.] Study Objectives: Examine the association between sleep duration and suicidal ideation in Korean adults. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data obtained by the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV (2007-2009) using a rolling sampling design involving a complex, stratified, multistage, and probability-cluster survey of civilian non-institutionalized Korean residents. Participants: A total of 15,236 subjects (6,638 males and 8,598 females) â‰¥ 19 years old. Measurements and Results: The weighted prevalence of self-reported short sleep duration (â‰¤ 5 h/day) was 11.7% in males and 15% in females, and of long sleep duration (â‰¥ 9 h/day) was 6.7% in males and 8.9% in females. A U-shaped relationship existed, with both short and long sleep durations associated with a higher suicidal ideation risk. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between sleep duration and suicidal ideation, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health behavior, and health status. After controlling for covariates, people with short sleep were 38.1% more likely to have suicidal ideation (OR = 1.381, 95% CI 1.156-1.650) than people with sleep duration of 7 h/day. Suicidal ideation was 1.196 times higher (95% CI: 0.950-1.507) in long-sleeping people than people sleeping 7 h/day, although statistically not significant. Inclusion of depressive mood (a potential confounder) in multiple logistic regression models attenuated but did not eliminate the sleep duration/suicidal ideation association. Limitations: Sleep duration and suicidal ideation were assessed only by self-report. Conclusions: The sleep duration/suicidal ideation relationship is U-shaped in the Korean adult population. Self-reported habitual sleep duration may be a useful behavioral indicator for both individual and societal suicidal ideation risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

The survey's target population was students in grades 7 through 12 in South Korea.; Independent Variable: Sleep time.; Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts.; Results: The odds of suicidal thoughts in subjects with very short or long time in bed were 1.487-fold higher (95% CI 1.219 to 1.815) or 0.611-fold lower (95% CI 0.460 to 0.811), respectively, than for subjects with 7â€…h/day in bed; the odds were similar for suicidal plans. The odds of suicidal thoughts in subjects with early or late awakening times were 1.231-fold higher (95% CI 1.050 to 1.442) or 1.528-fold lower (95% CI 1.000 to 2.334), respectively, than for subjects with 7â€…h/day in bed; these odds were lower for suicidal plans and attempts. The odds of suicidal thoughts in subjects with early bedtime were 1.748-fold higher (95% CI 1.302 to 2.346), the odds of suicidal plans in people with an early bedtime were 2.494-fold higher (95% CI 1.671 to 3.722) and the odds of suicide attempts in subjects with late bedtime were 1.313-fold higher (95% CI 1.005 to 1.716) than for subjects with a bedtime of 23:00.; Conclusions: The sleep-related time is associated with suicide-related behaviours in Korean adolescents.

704,Gender Differences in Depressive Symptom Profile: Results from Nationwide General Population Surveys in Korea,"This study investigated gender differences in symptom profiles of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Korean general population. Data were pooled from the series of nationwide Korean Epidemiologic Catchment Area surveys conducted in 2001, 2006 and 2011, respectively. Of the 18,807 participants, 507 (397 women and 110 men) were diagnosed with MDD within the prior 12 months. In agreement with previous studies, women with MDD appeared to be more vulnerable to experiencing atypical depressive episodes defined as depression with two or more symptoms of fatigue, increased appetite and hypersomnia (P < 0.001). In terms of individual symptoms, female gender was significantly related with higher prevalence of fatigue (P = 0.008), hypersomnia (P = 0.001), noticeable psychomotor retardation (P = 0.029) and suicidal attempts (P = 0.016) with adjustment for birth cohort effect, partner status, and employment status. In the same analysis, men with MDD appeared more vulnerable to decreased libido than women (P = 0.009). This is the first report to demonstrate gender differences in symptomatology of MDD in the general Korean population, and the results are comparable to previous investigations from western societies. Assumingly, the intercultural similarity in female preponderance to atypical depression might reflect the common biological construct underlying the gender difference in mechanism of MDD. In clinical settings, gender differences of MDD should be carefully considered, because these features could be related with treatment response and drug side effects.; Depression/*diagnosis, Depression/*epidemiology, Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology, Fatigue/*epidemiology, Symptom Assessment/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Depression/psychology, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Employment/psychology, Employment/statistics & numerical data, Fatigue/psychology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Reproducibility of Results, Republic of Korea/epidemiology, Risk Assessment, Sensitivity and Specificity, Sex Distribution, Sex Factors, Spouses/psychology, Spouses/statistics & numerical data, Young Adult, Depressive Disorder, Major, Sex, Symptoms, Women, Korea","Kim, Ji-Hyun; Cho, Maeng Je; Hong, Jin Pyo; Bae, Jae Nam; Cho, Seong-Jin; Hahm, Bong-Jin; Lee, Dong-Woo; Park, Jong-Ik; Lee, Jun-Young; Jeon, Hong Jin & Chang, Sung Man",1,704
705,Comparison of physical and mental health status between cancer survivors and the general population: a Korean population-based survey (KNHANES II-IV),"Purpose: To compare the physical and mental health status of the general population with that of cancer survivors in South Korea.; Methods: We analyzed 19,035 subjects (age â‰¥40Â years), who participated in the 2001-2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II-IV. We compared metabolic syndrome components, health behaviors, and mental health outcomes between cancer survivors and non-cancer controls.; Results: Cancer survivors accounted for 1.68Â % (nâ€‰=â€‰316) of total population. Cancer survivors did not show low occurrence of hypertension and diabetes compared to the control group. Both cancer survivors and the general population had high risks of physical inactivity (75.4Â % and 75.5Â %, respectively) and inadequate sleep (52.5Â % and 60.7Â %, respectively). In the unadjusted model, depression was more common in cancer survivors (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95Â % CI, 1.22-2.74), so was suicidal ideation (OR, 1.51; 95Â % CI, 0.16-1.96) than non-cancer controls. After adjustment for attributable socioeconomic factors, the elevated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) among cancer survivors were reduced by 23Â % in depression and 45Â % in suicidal thought. Cancer survivors at <5Â years from diagnosis showed a high occurrence of depression (aOR, 1.77; 95Â % CI, 1.09-2.85) while the magnitude of aOR decreases after â‰¥5Â years from cancer diagnosis (aOR, 1.38; 95Â % confidence interval, 0.97-1.98, respectively).; Conclusions: The physical and mental health of South Korean cancer survivors was not optimal. Their control rates of modifiable risk factors were similar or even lower than those for the non-cancer groups.

Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regressions to identify the relationships between dry eye symptoms and other factors.; Results: The prevalence of dry eye symptoms was 17.9%. After adjustment for confounding factors, dry eye symptoms were significantly associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.806; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.410-2.313), a history of cataract (aOR, 1.683; 95% CI, 1.255-2.255), suicidal ideation (aOR, 1.414; 95% CI, 1.070-1.870), hypercholesterolemia (aOR, 1.289; 95% CI, 1.025-1.621), age â‰¥80 years (aOR, 0.538; 95% CI, 0.337-0.859), and sleep duration â‰¥9 h/d (aOR, 0.524; 95% CI, 0.330-0.834).; Conclusion: Among elderly Koreans, female sex, a history of cataract, suicidal ideation, and hypercholesterolemia may be the risk factors for dry eye symptoms, whereas sleep duration â‰¥9 h/d can be a protective factor against dry eye symptoms.; Aged, Dry eye syndromes, Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Risk factors","Kim, Kyong In; Park, Yong Soon; Kim, Ryoung Hee & Kim, Jeong Hyeon",1,706
707,"High stress, lack of sleep, low school performance, and suicide attempts are associated with high energy drink intake in adolescents","Objective: Although an association between energy drinks and suicide has been suggested, few prior studies have considered the role of emotional factors including stress, sleep, and school performance in adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate the association of energy drinks with suicide, independent of possible confounders including stress, sleep, and school performance. Methods: In total, 121,106 adolescents with 13Â±18 years olds from the 2014 and 2015 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were surveyed for age, sex, region of residence, economic level, paternal and maternal education level, sleep time, stress level, school performance, frequency of energy drink intake, and suicide attempts. Subjective stress levels were classified into severe, moderate, mild, a little, and no stress. Sleep time was divided into 6 groups: < 6 h; 6 h < 7; 7 h < 8; 8 h < 9; and 9 h. School performance was classified into 5 levels: A (highest), B (middle, high), C (middle), D (middle, low), and E (lowest). Frequency of energy drink consumption was divided into 3 groups: 3, 1âˆ’2, and 0 times a week. The associations of sleep time, stress level, and school performance with suicide attempts and the frequency of energy drink intake were analyzed using multiple and ordinal logistic regression analysis, respectively, with complex sampling. The relationship between frequency of energy drink intake and suicide attempts was analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis with complex sampling. Results: Higher stress levels, lack of sleep, and low school performance were significantly associated with suicide attempts (each P < 0.001). These variables of high stress level, abnormal sleep time, and low school performance were also proportionally related with higher energy drink intake (P < 0.001). Frequent energy drink intake was significantly associated with suicide attempts in multiple logistic regression analyses (AOR for frequency of energy intake 3 times a week = 3.03, 95% CI = 2.64âˆ’3.49, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Severe stress, inadequate sleep, and low school performance were related with more energy drink intake and suicide attempts in Korean adolescents. Frequent energy drink intake was positively related with suicide attempts, even after adjusting for stress, sleep time, and school performance.

708,"Gender differences in adolescent coping behaviors and suicidal ideation: Findings from a sample of 73,238 adolescents","Suicide among adolescents is an emerging global public health problem as well as a socioeconomic problem. Stress-coping strategies have been shown to be associated with suicidal ideation. We examined coping behaviors related to suicidal ideation and gender differences in adolescents using the data from the 2010 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey (ages 12â€“19 years; N = 73,238). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between suicidal ideation and specific coping behaviors while controlling for potentially confounding variables. In both male and female groups, the coping behavior 'drinking alcoholic beverages' and 'smoking cigarettes' were positively associated with suicidal ideation. 'Watching TV,' 'playing online/mobile games,' and 'sleeping' were negatively associated with suicidal ideation in both groups. In males, 'engaging in sports' was negatively related to suicidal ideation. In females, 'venting by talking to others' and 'eating' were negatively related to suicidal ideation. The results indicate that there are gender differences in the effects of coping behaviors on adolescent suicidal ideation, and that developing adaptive coping strategies may function to reduce suicidality. Future studies are needed to examine whether improving coping skills can reduce suicidal ideation in a gender-specific manner.

709,Associations of mental health and sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity: A population-based study,"This study aimed to examine whether the characteristics of mental health and sleep duration, alone or in combination, are associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. This population-based, cross-sectional study analyzed the data from 4445 women aged 19â€“49 years, who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010â€“2012. A structured questionnaire was used to assess mental health characteristics, sleep duration, and menstrual cycle irregularity. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. High stress, depressive mood, and suicidal ideation were associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity after adjusting for confounding variables (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.33 [1.07â€“1.65], 1.56 [1.17â€“2.07], and 1.37 [1.01â€“1.87], respectively). Short sleep duration (â‰¤ 5 h a day) was significantly associated with higher odds of severe menstrual cycle irregularity with menstrual interval of greater than 3 months (2.67 [1.35â€“5.27]). Participants with sleep duration of â‰¤ 5 h a day with psychological stress, depressive mood, or suicidal ideation had higher odds of menstrual cycle irregularity (1.96 [1.26â€“3.05], 2.86 [1.50â€“5.44], and 2.25 [1.18â€“4.29]). This study suggests positive associations of mental health problems and short sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adults. Therefore, strategies to deal with psychological stress, depressive mood, and sleep duration are needed for improving the reproductive health of women suffering from menstrual disturbances.

710,Retrospective case series of aripiprazole augmentation in pervasive developmental disorders,"Due to co-morbidities and treatment resistant nature of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), diverse combinations of regimens have been tried. This retrospective study aimed to explore adjunctive use of aripiprazole in children with PDD. Changes in illness severity were measured by Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) in 14 aripiprazole-treated patients with PDD. Improvement of illness severity was observed after aripiprazole add-on (5.8Â±0.8 to 4.9Â±1.0, Z=-2.75, p=0.001). Mean dosage was 7.7 mg/day [standard deviation (SD) 3.3, range 5-15]. A higher mean dosage was observed in group with improvement in symptoms (t=-2.33, df =12, p=0.004). The target symptoms most effectively improved after using aripiprazole were positive psychotic symptoms (mean CGI-I: 2.0Â±1.4, 3 responders/4 patients, 75% response) followed by aggressive behavior (2.5Â±1.7, 3/4, 75%), self-injurious behavior (2.0Â±1.0, 2/3, 67%), stereotypic behavior (2.7Â±1.2, 2/3, 67%), tic (2.8Â±1.0, 2/4, 50%), irritability (3.5Â±2.1, 1/2, 50%), obsessive behavior (2.5Â±2.1, 1/3, 33%), hyperactivity (3.4Â±1.6, 3/7, 43%) and mood fluctuation (3, 0/1, no response). Five patients (35%) discontinued aripiprazole due to treatment-emergent adverse effects (akathisia, insomnia, withdrawal). The results of this study suggest that aripiprazole augmentation may be used safely in maladaptive behaviors of some populations of PDD.

711,Molecular Mechanisms of Bipolar Disorder: Progress Made and Future Challenges,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and progressive psychiatric illness characterized by mood oscillations, with episodes of mania and depression. The impact of BD on patients can be devastating, with up to 15% of patients committing suicide. This disorder is associated with psychiatric and medical comorbidities and patients with a high risk of drug abuse, metabolic and endocrine disorders and vascular disease. Current knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms causing BD is still modest. With no clear biological markers available, early diagnosis is a great challenge to clinicians without previous knowledge of the longitudinal progress of illness. Moreover, despite recommendations from evidence-based guidelines, polypharmacy is still common in clinical treatment of BD, reflecting the gap between research and clinical practice. A major challenge in BD is the development of effective drugs with low toxicity for the patients. In this review article, we focus on the progress made and future challenges we face in determining the pathophysiology and molecular pathways involved in BD, such as circadian and metabolic perturbations, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction, autophagy and glutamatergic neurotransmission; which may lead to the development of new drugs.; bipolar disorder, disease modeling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, glutamate, hyperexcitability, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress","Kim, Yeni; Santos, Renata; Gage, Fred H. & Marchetto, Maria C.",0,711
712,"Associations between adolescents sleep duration, sleep satisfaction, and suicidal ideation","Introduction: Both sleep and suicide are important issues among adolescents. Despite the extensive literature explaining short sleep duration as an important suicide risk factor, most previous studies did not consider sleep quality. Objective: This study identified associations between sleep duration, sleep satisfaction, and suicidal ideation in adolescents. Method: This cross-sectional study analyzed 58 848 adolescents using raw data from the tenth Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey conducted by Koreaâ€™s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Analyses incorporated sampling weights to account for the complex sampling design. Results: In multivariate analysis, suicidal ideation of participants sleeping less than four hours was 1.36 times higher than that of participants sleeping more than nine hours. Sleep satisfaction was 1.20 times higher when moderate, 1.38 times higher when dissatisfied, and 1.64 times higher when very dissatisfied than when very satisfied. Discussion and conclusion: It is necessary not only to improve sleep quality, but also to extend sleep duration in order to prevent adolescent suicide. If it is actually difficult to extend sleep duration due to school, a plan to increase subjective sleep satisfaction by improving sleep quality is required. This study showed the association between sleep duration and sleep satisfaction in adolescents. Therefore, in order to prevent adolescent suicide, it is necessary not only to extend their sleep duration, but also to improve their sleep quality.

713,The natural history of sleep disturbance among OEF/OIF veterans with TBI and PTSD and the role of proxy variables in its measurement,"Objective: Sleep disturbance crosscuts post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Though previous cross-sectional findings demonstrate a compounding effect of PTSD and TBI comorbidity, relatively little is known about the longitudinal trajectory of sleep-related complaints in veterans with TBI history and current PTSD symptoms. In this study, we explored patterns and predictors of sleep complaints in a sample of combat veterans with and without TBI and PTSD. Methods: Secondary analysis of data gathered during a longitudinal study of U.S. veterans of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) with and without TBI. Data from a subsample of 291 participants with sleep self-report data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression logit testing and linear mixed models. Results: Over an 18-month period, we observed an average 23â€“28% reduction in sleep symptoms in our sample as measured by two proxy scales, with the bulk of change (12â€“14% overall reduction) detected at the first six-month follow-up assessment. TBI history emerged, overall, as the most prominent predictor of worse general sleep symptoms, though baseline PTSD and pain status also demonstrated an association with worse sleep symptoms. Conclusion: Whereas changes in PTSD symptoms over time were associated with worsening sleep symptoms, improvement in sleep reports was most consistently predicted by the passage of time. Our data also provide preliminary support for using three-to-four core items (i.e., trouble sleeping, changes in sleep, fatigue, and nightmares) to screen for sleep complaints in veterans with TBI and PTSD and/or track sleep-related outcomes.

However, mental health care is not a component of routine hospital-based antenatal care for medically high-risk pregnant women.; Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the hospital-based implementation of a Web-based integrated mental health intervention comprising psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for antenatal inpatients.; Methods: This study is a quasi-experimental design. Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they are (1) <37 weeks gestation, (2) admitted to the antenatal inpatient unit for >72 hours, (3) able to speak and read English or be willing to use a translation service to assist with completion of the questionnaires and intervention, (4) able to complete follow-up email questionnaires, (5) >16 years of age, and (6) not actively suicidal. Women admitted to the unit for induction (eg, <72-hour length of stay) are excluded. A minimum sample of 54 women will be recruited from the antenatal high-risk unit of a large, urban tertiary care hospital. All women will complete a Web-based psychosocial assessment and 6 Web-based CBT modules. Results of the psychosocial assessment will be used by a Web-based clinical decision support system to generate a clinical risk score and clinician prompts to provide recommendations for the best treatment and referral options. The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence at 3-months postpartum; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment and 3-months postpartum. Qualitative interviews with 10-15 health care providers and 15-30 women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.; Results: The study was funded in September, 2014 and ethics was approved in November, 2014. Subject recruitment will begin January, 2015 and results are expected in December, 2015. Results of this study will determine (1) the effectiveness of an integrated Web-based prenatal mental health intervention on maternal and infant outcomes and (2) the feasibility of implementation of the intervention on a high-risk antenatal unit.; Conclusions: This study will provide evidence and guidance regarding the implementation of a Web-based mental health program into routine hospital-based care for women with medically high-risk pregnancies.; Web-based, anxiety, cognitive behavior therapy, depression, pregnancy, psychological stress, quasi-experimental studies, screening","Kingston, Dawn; Janes-Kelley, Selikke; Tyrrell, Janie; Clark, Lorna; Hamza, Deena; Holmes, Penny; Parkes, Cheryl; Moyo, Nomagugu; McDonald, Sheila & Austin, Marie-Paule",1,714
715,Substance use and risk of death in young offenders: A prospective data linkage study,"Introduction and Aims: Young offenders are at increased risk of preventable death after release from custody, but risk factors for death in this population are poorly understood. Despite their poor health profiles, no studies have examined mortality outcomes in young people who have served communityâ€based orders. The aims of this study were to describe the causes and identify risk factors for death in a cohort of young offenders in Victoria, Australia. Design and Methods: We interviewed young people serving a custodial (n = 273) or communityâ€based order (n = 242) in Victoria, Australia in 2002â€“2003. Measures included demographics and family history, offence history, experience of victimisation, mental illness, selfâ€harm and substance use. Deaths up to 31 December 2011 were identified through a probabilistic linkage with the National Death Index. Results: The allâ€cause crude mortality rate was 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7â€“6.8) per 1000 person years and was not significantly different for those who had served custodial and communityâ€based orders. Most deaths were due to drug overdose, traffic accidents or suicide. Adjusting for age, sex and order type, risk factors for death from the baseline interview included weekly use of opioids, sleeping pills or painkillers, polydrug use and injecting drug use. Discussion and Conclusions: Young people who have served communityâ€based and custodial orders are at an increased risk of preventable death. Those engaging in risky substance use, particularly injecting drug use and use of multiple central nervous system depressants, are at greatest risk. There is an urgent need to develop and rigorously evaluate preventive interventions.

716,Cyberbullying perpetration among undergraduates: Evidence of the roles of chronotype and sleep quality,"Cyberbullying is one of the important negative issues among adolescents and youngsters. Victims of cyberbullying perpetration have been reported to suffer many psychological and emotional problems that can lead them as far to suicide. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of cyberbullying perpetration with gender, personality traits, chronotype, and sleep quality. Three hundred and fifty-three freshman and sophomore university students from Turkey (45.9% (n = 162) female and 54.1% (n = 191) male) completed a questionnaire that included Cyberbullying Scale, Big-5 Inventory, Composite Scale of Morningness, and Sleep Quality Scale. The most conspicuous result of the study was that chronotype and sleep quality were significant predictors of cyberbullying perpetration. Evening-type students had significantly higher scores on cyberbullying scale than neither-type students and morning-type students, and also neither-type students had higher scores on cyberbullying scale than morning-type students. Further, poorer sleep quality, being male, higher extraversion, higher neuroticism, and lower conscientiousness were related to higher cyberbullying perpetration","Kırcaburun, Kağan; Tosuntaş, Şule Betül",1,716
717,"Determinants of sleep duration and sleep quality: Gender differences, coping and health outcome","1,276 adults completed a European internet survey detailing areas of the personal health, stress coping strategies and sleeping habits. Males reported sleeping shorter than females (6.76 vs. 6.99 hours per day) but complained paradoxically"" of having less quality sleep. Of the respondents 34.5% were short sleepers (6 or less hours per day) 21.3% slept 8 hours per day and 3.9% were long sleepers (9 or more hours per day). The subjective reports of less satisfaction with the quality of sleep (sleeplessness) were predicted by the gender the hours slept the units of alcohol drunken and the exercise taken (in hours per week). The age the weekly hours of work and the smoking behavior were not consistently related to the quality of sleep. Gender differences in stress coping influenced the sleeping behavior. These findings have both medical and psychological health care implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA all rights reserved). (journal abstract)""Accession Number: 2012-04413-008.

718,Varenicline for smoking cessation in people with schizophrenia: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of varenicline adjuvant therapy for smoking cessation in people with schizophrenia, on the basis of a previous meta-analysis (Tsoi in Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2:CD007253, 2013). We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library databases, and PsycINFO up to August 1, 2014. RCTs comparing varenicline adjuvant therapy with placebo in schizophrenia were included. The risk ratio (RR), number needed to harm (NNH), and standardized mean differences with its 95 % confidence interval (CI) were used. Seven studies (total n = 439), including 6 with only schizophrenia (total n = 352), 1 with both schizophrenia (n = 77) and bipolar disorder (n = 10), were included. Varenicline was not superior to placebo in smoking cessation (RR = 0.79, 95 % CI 0.58-1.08, p = 0.14, 5 RCTs, n = 322). Varenicline failed to show its superiority to placebo for overall, positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the discontinuation rate due to all causes, clinical deterioration, or side effects between varenicline and placebo. Although varenicline caused less abnormal dreams/nightmares than placebo (RR = 0.47, 95 % CI 0.22-0.99, p = 0.05, NNH = not significant, 4 RCTs, n = 288), it caused more nausea (RR = 1.79, 95 % CI 1.20-2.67, p = 0.004, NNH = 6, p = 0.004, 6 RCTs, n = 417). We detected no significant difference in suicidal ideation and depression between varenicline and placebo. Our results suggest that although varenicline adjuvant therapy is well tolerated, varenicline is not superior to placebo for smoking cessation in people with schizophrenia. Because of the limited sample sizes of the available studies, future studies will require larger samples to ensure that these findings are generalizable.

719,Appetite loss as a potential predictor of suicidal ideation and self-harm in adolescents: A school-based study,"Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, but detection of its risk is often challenging. Many mental illnesses share the common symptom of appetite loss and it is also known that people who suffer from these illnesses are at greater risk of suicide. However, the relationship between appetite loss and suicide risk has yet to be examined. For adolescents in particular, questions about appetite loss may be easier to answer than sensitive questions regarding mental health. The present study aims to investigate the association of appetite loss with suicidal ideation and self-harm in adolescents. Rates of adolescents with suicidal ideation or self-harm associated with appetite-loss were examined in 18,250 Japanese junior and senior high school students (aged 12e18) using a self-report questionnaire. Insomnia, a physical symptom which has previously been associated with suicide risk, was also controlled for in the analysis. Results showed that rates of adolescents with suicidal ideation or self-harm significantly increased according to the degree of self-reported appetite loss. Similar results were observed for insomnia. Odds ratios (ORs) for suicidal ideation and self-harm were 5.5 and 4.1 for adolescents with appetite loss compared to those without it, and the ORs were 5.5 and 3.5 for those with insomnia compared to those without it, respectively, adjusting for sex and age (p < 0.001). ORs remained statistically significant after adjusting for depression/anxiety (General Health Questionnaire-12 score). In conclusion, self-reported appetite loss was highly associated with suicidal ideation and self-harm in adolescents; adolescents reporting physical symptoms such as loss of appetite or insomnia should be given careful attention.

720,Developing quality measures for adolescent care: validity of adolescents' self-reported receipt of preventive services,"Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of directly surveying adolescents about the content of preventive health services they have received and to assess the validity of adolescent self-reported recall.; Data Sources/setting: Audiotaped encounters, telephone interviews, and chart reviews with 14-21 year olds being seen for preventive care visits at 15 pediatric and family medicine private practices, teaching hospital clinics, and health centers.; Design: 537 adolescents presenting for well visits were approached, 400 (75 percent) consented, 374 (94 percent) were audiotaped, and 354 (89 percent) completed telephone interviews either two to four weeks or five to seven months after their visits. Audiotapes were coded for screening and counseling across 34 preventive service content areas. Intraobserver reliability (Cohen's kappa) ranged from 0.45 for talking about peers to 0.94 for discussing tobacco. The sensitivity and specificity of the adolescent self-reports were assessed using the audiotape coding as the gold standard.; Results: Almost all adolescents surveyed (94 percent) remembered having had a preventive care visit, 93 percent identified the site of care, and most (84 percent) identified the clinician they had seen. There was wide variation in the prevalence of screening, based on the tape coding. Adolescent self-report was moderately or highly sensitive and specific at two weeks and six months for 24 of 34 screening and counseling items, including having discussed: weight, diet, body image, exercise, seatbelts, bike helmet use, cigarettes/smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, drugs, steroids, sex, sexual orientation, birth control, condoms, HIV, STDs, school, family, future plans, emotions, suicidality, and abuse. Self-report was least accurate for blood pressure/cholesterol screening, immunizations, or for having discussed fighting, violence, weapon carrying, sleep, dental care, friends, or over-the-counter drug use.; Conclusion: Adolescents' self-report of the care they have received is a valid method of determining the content of preventive health service delivery. Although recall of screening and counseling is more accurate within two to four weeks after preventive care visits, adolescents can report accurately on the care they had received five to seven months after the preventive health care visits occurred.;Adolescent Health Services/*standards, Patient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data, Preventive Health Services/*standards, Quality Indicators, Health Care/*standards, Adolescent, Adolescent Health Services/statistics & numerical data, Adolescent Health Services/utilization, Adult, Community Health Services/standards, Community Health Services/statistics & numerical data, Community Health Services/utilization, Female, Health Care Surveys/methods, Humans, Male, New York, Office Visits/statistics & numerical data, Office Visits/utilization, Preventive Health Services/statistics & numerical data, Preventive Health Services/utilization, Quality Indicators, Health Care/statistics & numerical data, Random Allocation, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Videotape Recording","Klein, J D; Graff, C A; Santelli, J S; Hedberg, V A; Allan, M J & Elster, A B",0,720
721,Abuse and toxicity of methylphenidate,"The therapeutic use of methylphenidate for the management of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children is increasing. As therapeutic use increases, the risk increases of unintentional overdoses, medication errors, and intentional overdoses caused by abuse, misuse, or suicide gestures and attempts. Side effects during therapy, which include nervousness, headache, insomnia, anorexia, and tachycardia, increase linearly with dose. Clinical manifestations of overdoses include agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, lethargy, seizures, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hyperthermia. Methylphenidate tablets can be abused orally, or they can be crushed and the powder injected or snorted. Despite its abuse potential, there is disagreement regarding the extent to which methylphenidate is being diverted from legitimate use to abuse in preteens and adolescents.;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*drug therapy, Central Nervous System Stimulants/*adverse effects, Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects, Methylphenidate/*adverse effects, Substance-Related Disorders/*etiology, Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage, Drug Overdose, Humans, Methylphenidate/administration & dosage","Klein-Schwartz, Wendy",0,721
722,The association between insomnia and suicidal thoughts in adults treated for alcohol dependence in Poland,"Background: Suicidal ideation is elevated for individuals with alcohol use disorders. Sleep problems are associated with suicide risk and alcohol use, and sleep problems may be associated with suicide risk in those with alcohol use disorders. For the present study, we hypothesized that self-reported sleep problems are associated with suicidal thoughts in a sample of adults seeking treatment for alcohol dependence in Poland. Methods: The sample included 304 patients in addiction treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland who met criteria for alcohol dependence. Measures included demographic characteristics, frequency of alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, suicidal ideation and two measures of insomnia, which differed by time frame: the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS, past 1 month) and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SDQ-7, past 6 months). Multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between insomnia and suicidal thoughts. Results: In models that controlled for age, gender, and days of recent drinking, both measures of sleep problems were associated with suicidal ideation: AOR = 2.01 (95% CI: 1.50-2.70) [AIS] and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.29-2.31) [SDQ-7]. The association of sleep problems, as measured by the AIS, with suicide remained significant after adjusting for psychiatric symptoms, although the estimated effect size was smaller (AOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05-2.06). Conclusions: Among Polish adults with alcohol dependence, insomnia severity was associated with suicidal ideation. This finding highlights the need to assess for sleep problems, in addition to suicidal thoughts, in alcohol treatment settings and to further examine the potential consequences of poor sleep in this population.

723,Muscular Complaints and Headache are Common Painful Physical Symptoms in Patients With Depression,"Background: Although common, painful physical symptoms are not listed as symptoms of depression in the leading (psychiatric) classifications ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Method: In this observational study, general practitioners and internists consecutively documented outpatients requiring an antidepressant. At baseline, after 6 weeks, 4 and 6 months of treatment with fluoxetine were recorded: Clinical global impression (CGI) using the CGI scale; depressed mood, anxiety, suicidality, lack of energy, sleep disturbances, restlessness, cardiovascular symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, diffuse physical symptoms, muscular complaints, and headache using a four-point Likert scale. For comparisons between males/females the Chi-Square-test was performed. This report is limited to pre-treatment baseline findings. Results: 927 of 1008 patients (92.0%) assigned to treatment with fluoxetine had the primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder. At baseline, in 94.3% of the 927 depressed patients (100%) severity of illness was at least moderate. 91.3% had at least one painful physical symptom (muscular complaints, headache, or both), in 58.9%, at least one symptom was moderate to severe. 65.8% suffered from both muscular complaints and headache simultaneously, in 27.0% both symptoms were at least moderately severe. Women showed painful physical symptoms significantly more often (p<0.01). Conclusion: The findings indicate that painful physical symptoms are common in depressed patients.

Their ages ranged from 65 to 85 years with a mean of 71.6 years, SD 5.5 years. Co-existing physical disorders were present in every patient, the average being 1.8 per patient, and half (n = 15) had two or more physical disorders. Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. ischaemic heart disease and hypertension) and diabetes mellitus were present in about seven-eighths of the patients. The two commonest symptoms were low mood (n = 18, 60%) and vague somatic complaints inexplicable by any physical pathology (n = 19, 63%). Sleep disturbance bothered 12 patients (40%), while nine (30%) had attempted suicide. Twenty patients (67%) were prescribed antidepressants and 13 (43%) received benzodiazepines in low dosages, mainly as hypnotics.

725,"Dasotraline for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial in adults","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity associated with clinically significant impairment in functioning. ADHD has an early onset, but frequently persists, with a prevalence estimate of 4% in adults. Dasotraline is a novel compound that is a potent inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters that achieves stable plasma concentrations with once-daily dosing. In this study, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD were randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind, once-daily treatment with dasotraline 4 and 8 mg/day or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline at week 4 in the ADHD Rating Scale, Version IV (ADHD RS-IV) total score. Secondary efficacy end points included the Clinical Global Impression, Severity (CGI-S) scale, modified for ADHD symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean improvements at week 4 in ADHD RS-IV total score were significantly greater for dasotraline 8 mg/day vs placebo (âˆ’13.9 vs âˆ’9.7; P = 0.019), and nonsignificantly greater for 4 mg/day (âˆ’12.4; P = 0.076). The LS mean improvements in modified CGI-S were significantly greater at week 4 for dasotraline 8 mg/day vs placebo (âˆ’1.1 vs âˆ’0.7; P = 0.013), and for 4 mg/day vs placebo (âˆ’1.1 vs âˆ’0.7; P = 0.021). The most frequent adverse events reported were insomnia, decreased appetite, nausea, and dry mouth. Discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events were 10.3% and 27.8% of patients in 4 and 8 mg/day treatment groups, respectively. This study provides preliminary evidence that once-daily dosing with dasotraline, a long-acting, dual monoamine reuptake inhibitor, may be a safe and efficacious treatment for adult ADHD.

726,Suicide risk among individuals with sleep disturbances in Japan: A case“control psychological autopsy study,"Objective: This caseâ€“control psychological autopsy study aimed to explore a relationship between sleep disturbances and suicide among Japanese, as well as determine the importance and usability of screening for sleep disturbances in suicide prevention. Methods: A semi-structured interview was conducted with the close family members of 49 adult suicide completers and 145 gender-, age-, and residential municipality-matched living controls. The survey included sections on demographics, sleep disturbances, and mental disorders. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to compare sleep disturbance prevalence between the two groups. Results: A significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances was found among the suicide group (75.5%) compared to the controls (11.0%) (odds ratio [OR] = 21.6, p < 0.001). The association remained significant after adjusting for mental disorders (OR = 12.7, p < 0.001). The population attributable risk percent of suicide associated with sleep disturbances and mental disorders was estimated to be 56.4% and 35.3%, respectively. Conclusions: The study confirmed that sleep disturbances are an important risk factor of suicide, independent of mental disorders. Sleep disturbances accounted for a greater proportion of suicide cases than did mental disorders in the Japanese population given the higher prevalence, and could thus be considered an important target in suicide prevention in Japan.

728,Aripiprazole-induced behavioural disturbance related to impulse control in a clinical setting,"We report two cases that exhibited unexpected adverse effects after administration of aripiprazole for treatment of bipolar disorder. A 57-yr-old male had his first depressive episode with insomnia, loss of concentration, and suicidal ideas at age 22 yr. He was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder when a manic episode occurred at age 38 yr. In July 2007, 3 mg/d aripiprazole was started. The depressive phase gradually improved to euthymia by October 2007 without any other change of medication. One year later, in September 2008, he showed loss of energy and diminished interest and pleasure. After discontinuation of aripiprazole, the hypersexuality diminished as expected. Although his mood improved gradually to euthymia, there was no symptom associated with mania. A 53-yr-old woman experienced her first depressive episode at the age of 21 yr. In October 2006, she was diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder because she experienced hyperactivity and excessive shopping, and lithium carbonate was prescribed. In October 2008, the excessive shopping remained unchanged, and aripiprazole was increased to 12 mg/d. However, 2 wk after administration of 12 mg/d aripiprazole was initiated, she described an increased urge to shop despite drowsiness and loss of interest. Therefore, aripiprazole was discontinued, and 2 wk later the increased urge to shop disappeared. Although aripiprazole is a new antipsychotic with a low risk of adverse effects, its distinctive feature as a dopamine partial agonist could cause unexpected side-effects. It is necessary to pay additional attention in clinical use.

729,Base Rates of Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease: An Individual Symptom Analysis,"Background: Major depression is common in coronary heart disease (CHD) but challenging to diagnose. Instead of focusing on the overall diagnosis of depression, base rates of depressive symptoms could facilitate screening and management of psychopathology in CHD. The present study investigates the frequency of individual depressive symptoms in CHD and their impact on cardiac and subjective health.; Methods: In total, 1337 in- and outpatients with CHD were screened for depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at three different cardiac treatment sites. Tables stratified by age and gender were designed to illustrate base rates of depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical data were conducted to test associations between individual depressive symptoms and quality of life as well impairment caused angina pectoris and dyspnea.; Results: During the last 14 days, more than half of patients reported a loss of energy (74.9%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 70.6-79.2), sleeping problems (69.4%, 95% CI: 64.9-74.0), loss of interest (55.7%, 95% CI: 50.8-60.7). In contrast, psychomotor change (25.6%, 95%CI: 21.3-30.0), feelings of failure (21.9%, 95%CI: 17.7-26.0), suicidal ideations (14.1%, 95%CI: 10.7-17.6) were less frequently reported. Depending on the outcome, only particular depressive symptoms were highly associated with low quality of life and impairment caused by angina pectoris and dyspnea. Loss of energy was the only depressive symptom that reliably predicted all three outcomes.; Conclusions: Depressive symptoms in CHD are frequent but vary widely in terms of frequency. Findings underline the differential effects of individual depressive symptoms on cardiac health. Presented base rates of depressive symptoms offer clinicians a new way to judge the severity of individual depressive symptoms and to communicate individual PHQ-9 profiles with patients with respect to gender, age, cardiac symptoms and quality of life.; Quality of Life*, Coronary Disease/*complications, Depressive Disorder/*etiology, Aged, Coronary Disease/psychology, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Female, Health Status, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Sickness Impact Profile, Surveys and Questionnaires","Kohlmann, Sebastian; Gierk, Benjamin; Murray, Alexandra M.; Scholl, Arne; Lehmann, Marco & LÃ¶we, Bernd",1,729
730,Neural basis of brain dysfunction produced by early sleep problems,"There is a wealth of evidence that disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms, which are common in modern society even during the early stages of life, have unfavorable effects on brain function. Altered brain function can cause problem behaviors later in life, such as truancy from or dropping out of school, quitting employment, and committing suicide. In this review, we discuss findings from several large cohort studies together with recent results of a cohort study using the marshmallow test, which was first introduced in the 1960s. This test assessed the ability of four-year-olds to delay gratification and showed how this ability correlated with success later in life. The role of the serotonergic system in sleep and how this role changes with age are also discussed. The serotonergic system is involved in reward processing and interactions with the dorsal striatum, ventral striatum, and the prefrontal cortex are thought to comprise the neural basis for behavioral patterns that are affected by the quantity, quality, and timing of sleep early in life.

731,The influence of menopause status and postmenopausal use of hormone therapy on presentation of major depression in women,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in depression characteristics among premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women with major depressive disorder. This study also evaluated these differences between postmenopausal women with major depressive disorder who are taking and not taking hormone therapy.; Methods: Analyses conducted with data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study focused on female outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder seeking treatment in 41 primary or psychiatric care settings across the United States. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared among women not taking hormone therapy who were premenopausal (n = 950), perimenopausal (n = 380), or postmenopausal (n = 562). These comparisons were also made between postmenopausal women (n = 768) taking (n = 171) or not taking (n = 562) hormone therapy.; Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical baseline differences, premenopausal women were more likely to present with irritability than were either perimenopausal or postmenopausal women and were more likely to have decreased appetite and less likely to have early-morning insomnia than were perimenopausal women. Postmenopausal women were more likely to have suicidal ideation and poorer physical functioning than were either of the other groups and were more likely to have sympathetic arousal and gastrointestinal symptoms than were premenopausal women. After adjusting for baseline differences, postmenopausal women taking hormone therapy had better physical functioning, fewer melancholic features, less sympathetic arousal, and more lack of involvement in activities than did women not taking hormone therapy.; Conclusions: Menopause status and postmenopausal use of hormone therapy may influence the clinical presentation of major depressive episodes in women.;Hormone Replacement Therapy*, Depressive Disorder, Major/*psychology, Menopause/*psychology, Postmenopause/*psychology, Adult, Appetite/physiology, Arousal/physiology, Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology, Depressive Disorder, Major/physiopathology, Female, Gastrointestinal Diseases/epidemiology, Gastrointestinal Diseases/physiopathology, Health Status, Humans, Irritable Mood/physiology, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/physiopathology, Suicide/psychology","Kornstein, Susan G; Young, Elizabeth A; Harvey, Annie T; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Barkin, Jennifer L; Thase, Michael E; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Nierenberg, Andrew A & Rush, A John",0,731
732,Are children and adolescents who have suicidal thoughts different from those who attempt suicide?,"Compared clinical symptoms and social factors in 340 Australian young outpatients (mean age 12.9 yrs), 258 who exhibited suicidal ideation and 82 who had actually attempted suicide. Ss with suicidal thoughts were not differentiated from Ss who attempted suicide on the basis of clinical symptoms alone. Both groups had high levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, and irritability. Conduct disorders were less common in both groups, but 22% of the attempters abused illicit drugs or alcohol. Suicide attempts were associated with chronic family discord and substance abuse. For boys, the odds of suicidal attempts were substantially increased by disruption of major attachments.

733,Risk of psychiatric and neurological diseases in patients with workplace mobbing experience in Germany: a retrospective database analysis,"Introduction: The number of mobbing experiences recorded has increased during recent years and it has now been established as global phenomenon among the working population. The goal of our study was to analyze the incidence of certain neurologic and psychiatric diseases as a consequence of mobbing as compared with a control group and to examine the possible influence of previous diseases that occurred within one year before the first mobbing documentation on the incidence of mobbing.; Material& Methods: We used a large database (IMSÂ® Disease Analyzer, Germany) to collect data from general practitioners in Germany from 01/2003 until 12/2012. Based on age, gender, and health insurance, patients with experience of mobbing were matched with a control group of patients who had not reported workplace mobbing and who were being treated by the same physicians. At first, diseases that occurred within one year before the bullying experience took place (index date"") were noted and compared to a control group of similar composition in terms of gender age and health insurance. Subsequently the prevalence of depression anxiety somatoform disorders and sleep disorders following experiences of mobbing were determined. After adjustment to take into account the odds of bullying the ratios of these diseases were assessed using a logistic regression model.; Results: The study population consisted of n=2625 patients and n=2625 controls of which 33% were men. The number of cases of bullying documented rose continuously from 2003 to 2011 and remained high in 2012. Those who would later become victims of mobbing demonstrated a considerably higher prevalence of diseases in general - these diseases were not confined to the neurologic-psychiatric spectrum. Following experiences of bullying depression anxiety somatoform disorders and sleep disorders were significantly more prevalent than in the control group (for all p<0.05). Similarly odds ratios (OR) representing the risk of suffering from diseases were higher in affected patients with the highest value (4.28) for depression and the lowest value for sleep disorders (OR=2.4).; Conclusion: Those who will later become the victims of bullying are more prone to suffer from diseases in general even before this experience of mobbing has occurred which underlines the importance of supporting (chronically) ill patients to protect them against bullying. Sequelae of mobbing include in particular diseases from the neurologic-psychiatric spectrum.;""Accession Number: 24872810. Language: English. Date Revised: 20150805. Date Created: 20140529.

734,The concept of temperament and its contribution to the understanding of the bipolar spectrum,"The present article attempts first to provide a historical overview of the concept of temperament, since its foundation by Polybos (4th century B.C.) and the school of Cos, its predominant role in the shaping of the anthropological and humanitarian sciences, until the modern theoretical formulations, such as those proposed by Robert Cloninger and Hagop Akiskal. Secondly, recent literature is presented, which suggests a strong link of different temperament structures to mental health and psychopathology. Hans Eysenck (1916-1997) was the first psychologist to establish approaches to personality differences and to distinguish three dimensions of personality: Neuroticism, Extraversion and Psychotisism. Eysenck was followed by McCrae and Costa who proposed that there are five basic dimensions of personality ('Big Five']. In the mid-1980s, Robert Cloninger developed a distinctive dimensional model of temperament and character traits. Hagop Akiskal emphasized on the affective components of temperament and their possible connections to mood disorders and creativity. Specifically, temperament assessment seems to help in differentiating between the relationship of various temperaments and the clinical manifestations of bipolar illness. Within the area of mood disorders, specific affective temperaments might constitute vulnerability factors, as well as clinical picture and illness course modifiers. Viewing mood disorders under this prism gives birth to the concept of the bipolar spectrum with major implications for all aspects of mental health research and providing of care. The hyperthymic and the depressive temperaments are related to the more 'classic' bipolar picture (that is euphoria, grandiose and paranoid thinking, antisocial behavior, psychomotor acceleration and reduced sleep and depressive episodes respectively). On the contrary cyclothymic, anxious and irritable temperaments are related to more complex pictures and might predict poor response to treatment, violent or suicidal behavior and high comorbidity. Unipolar disorder diagnosis is often changed due to the fact that a manic or mixed episode can occur after several years of treatment failure. In these cases the evaluation of temperament can prove to be effective in distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression and thus favoring treatment planning. In addition, temperament assessment changes the definition of bipolarity by supporting the concept of 'bipolar spectrum'. This is a factor that can lead to a rise in prevalence of bipolar cases. Furthermore, the evaluation of temperament has shifted our understanding of bipolarity towards the concept of the 'bipolar spectrum'. It has also led to an increase in the prevalence of bipolar disorder cases, notably bipolar II, and a decrease in unipolar cases. Finally, incorporating the concept of temperament in our understanding of bipolar disorder constitutes a challenging issue, which can lead to better treatment and outcome of patients.

735,Agitated depression as a mixed state and the problem of melancholia,"The extensive use of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of all forms of depression makes the question of the real nature of agitated depression a crucial issue because many patients have adverse outcomes, including increased agitation, increased insomnia, increased risk of suicide, and sometimes the onset of psychotic symptoms. Agitated depression is no longer considered a mixed state in the DSM system. After a review of the literature on melancholia agitata as a mixed state and on the introduction of the concept of mixed states, this article has examined the psychopathology of agitated depression. The main symptoms are depressive mood with marked anxiety, restlessness, and often delusions. In other cases, psychic agitation and racing or crowded thoughts prevail alongside anxiety and depressed mood. The mixed nature of these symptoms has been discussed and new diagnostic criteria proposed, including those syndromes without marked restlessness but with evident psychic agitation and racing or crowded thoughts. It is suggested that all the varieties of agitated depression be called mixed depression, with the following diagnostic criteria: A. Major depressive episode B. At least two of the following symptoms: 1. Motor agitation 2. Psychic agitation or intense inner tension 3.

736,Biological perspectives: Huntingtons disease,"This article briefs the ways to understand and treat the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms of Huntingtonâ€™s Disease (HD). Huntingtonâ€™s disease, or HD, is a progressive inherited neurodegenerative disorder which causes disturbances in movement; specifically, choreiform or involuntary and non-repetitive dance-like movements. It also causes a specific type of dementia and a variety of psychiatric disturbances such as depression, agitation, irritability, apathy, anxiety, delusions, and hallucinations. HD has an irreversible and fatal course and the underlying condition itself is currently untreatable. A 34-year-old male patient with HD, referred by a movement disorder neurological specialist, presented with suicidal thoughts, anger, irritability, disrupted sleep patterns, forgetfulness, impulsivity which involved stealing money from family members, and gambling away the $4,000 which he had stolen. He displayed general inactivity and social isolation, and had experienced a gradual loss of autonomy and self direction in his functioning. Medication management and supportive psychotherapy were recommended, and he met in bimonthly follow-up sessions. He was prescribed paroxetine, initially at 20 mg/day, and dosing was increased over subsequent visits because of incomplete responsiveness at lower doses. Later, olanzapine at 2.5 mg nightly was added to address sleep and anxiety difficulties, and then increased to 5 mg per night. His mood and irritability improved and participation in HD support groups and end-of-life planning was encouraged, but he was reluctant to undertake these efforts at the time of this report.

737,Sleep problems and suicide attempts among adolescents: A case-control study,"This study used a case-control design to compare sleep disturbances in 40 adolescents who attempted suicide with 40 never-suicidal adolescents. Using hierarchical logistic regression analyses, we found that self-reported nighttime awakenings were significantly associated with attempted suicide, after controlling for antidepressant use, antipsychotic use, affective problems, and being bullied. In a separate regression analysis, the parent-reported total sleep problems score also predicted suicide attempt status, controlling for key covariates. No associations were found between suicide attempts and other distinct sleep problems, including falling asleep at bedtime, sleeping a lot during the day, trouble waking up in the morning, sleep duration, and parent-reported nightmares. Clinicians should be aware of sleep problems as potential risk factors for suicide attempts for adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

738,Anxiety in older adults often goes undiagnosed,"Anxiety disorder in the elderly is twice as common as dementia and four to six times more common than major depression. Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines). Substance and alcohol abuse should be excluded, as withdrawal from either may cause anxiety. A new or exacerbated physical illness may be related to anxiety. Medical investigations will help clarify the extent to which a particular somatic symptom is the result of anxiety.; Anxiety/*diagnosis, Anxiety Disorders/*diagnosis, Aged, Anxiety/therapy, Anxiety Disorders/therapy, Humans","Koychev, Ivan & Ebmeier, Klaus P.",0,738
739,"Dimensions of depression, mania and psychosis in the general population","Background: In order to investigate whether correlated but separable symptom dimensions that have been identified in clinical samples also have a distribution in the general population, the underlying structure of symptoms of depression, mania and psychosis was studied in a general population sample of 7072 individuals. Method: Data were obtained from the three measurements of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS). Symptoms of depression, mania and the positive symptoms of psychosis were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Confirmatory factor-analysis was used to test statistically the fit of hypothesized models of one, two, three or seven dimensions. Results: The seven-dimensional model comprising core depression, sleep problems, suicidal thoughts, mania, paranoid delusions, first-rank delusions and hallucinations fitted the data best, whereas the unidimensional model obtained the poorest fit. This pattern of results could be replicated at both follow-up measurements. The results were similar for the subsamples with and without a lifetime DSM-III-R diagnosis. The seven dimensions were moderately to strongly correlated, with correlations ranging from 0-18 to 0-73 (mean 0-45). Conclusions: In the general population, seven correlated but separable dimensions of experiences exist that resemble dimensions of psychopathology seen in clinical samples with severe mental illness. The substantial correlations between these dimensions in clinical and non-clinical samples may suggest that there is aetiological overlap between the different dimensions regardless of level of severity and diagnosable disorder.

740,Rapid resolution of intense suicidal ideation after treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnea,"Patients with insomnia may develop suicidal ideation; however, we know of no reports of suicidal ideation associated with obstructive sleep apnea. We report on a 74-year-old man who presented to his primary care physician with excessive daytime sleepiness, poor quality nocturnal sleep, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation with active suicide plans. An emergency outpatient psychiatry consultation was arranged. The patient declined psychiatric hospitalization. He agreed to a trial of continuous positive airway pressure, using a self-titrating machine, followed by an urgent sleep study. Polysomnography revealed an apnea hypopneaindex of 64, arousal index of 91 and minimum oxygen saturation of 65%. The patient's sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness responded to nCPAP. The patient declined antidepressant medication but had excellent adherence to nCPAP. Suicidal ideation and depression resolved promptly and at 4-month followup were in remission.

741,Sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation in sleep medical center patients,"Objective: The purpose of this investigation was two-fold: first, we examined associations between suicidal ideation, maladaptive sleep patterns and abnormal sleep behaviors in a sleep center population, an understudied population in the domain of suicide research; and then, we explored whether significant associations remained after accounting for the possible influence of depressive symptoms. Method: Data were analyzed from intake information obtained from 1584 adult patients presenting at a community-based private sleep medical center. The sample was parsed into a Suicidal Ideation (SI) group (N = 211) and No Suicidal Ideation (NSI) group (N = 1373). Comparisons of these groups were made on measures of self-reported sleep complaints, habits, and behaviors, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and associated psychopathology. Results: Approximately 13% of participants reported suicidal ideation. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was present in 4.5% of the sample. Compared to the NSI group, the SI group showed a pervasive pattern of significantly greater frequency or severity of sleep problems in areas of insomnia, nightmares and other parasomnia behaviors, poor sleep quality, and sleep-related psychophysiologic conditioning as well as worse sleep-related impairment and quality of life. Several relationships were significant after controlling for depressive symptoms. Discussion: Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with a broad array of sleep complaints, even when controlling for level of depressive symptoms. As these self-reported sleep disturbances are treatable sleep disorders, future research should examine the efficacy of sleep and behavioral medicine for reducing the risk of suicidal ideation.

742,Clinical realities and economic considerations: Patient selection in intrathecal therapy,"States that in selected chronic nonmalignant pain patients, the failure to derive sufficient pain relief from traditional measures (physiotherapy, electrostimulation, nonopioid and adjuvant analgesic drugs, and psychological interventions) justifies a trial of systemic opioid administration. For patients who do not achieve a favorable balance between analgesia and side effects with systemic therapy, intraspinal delivery of opioids may improve pain relief, reduce suffering, and enhance quality of life and functional ability. Patient selection is a significant determinant of the success of this approach. Because pain is a biopsychosocial phenomenon, psychological and social assessment are essential along with adequate trials of opioid responsiveness. Psychological impediments to a successful outcome must be ruled out, and treatment expectations assessed, prior to an intraspinal analgesia trial. Use of multiple psychometric tests is recommended for increased reliability and validity of identifying risk factors (psycopathology, mood disorder, potential for self-harm, dementia, anxiety, catastrophizing, distress, addictive issues, and sleep disturbance) that might dispose a patient to chronic pain and influence treatment outcomes. Intraspinal pain therapy trials are discussed.

Of the models that used fewer than 9 items, the best fit was for the 6-item solution with 3 somatic items (sleep, appetite, and fatigue) and 3 nonsomatic items (feeling down, feeling bad about self, and suicidal ideation; RMSEA = 0.043). Similar results were found across the strata except for the Hispanic group (for whom no model fit well).; Conclusions: Given the results of this analysis that support a 2-factor structure of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in persons with SCI, the next step in this line of research is to validate each of these dimensions against other ways of measuring depression.; Copyright Â© 2011 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

744,"Hypnotic drug risks of mortality, infection, depression, and cancer: but lack of benefit","This is a review of hypnotic drug risks and benefits, reassessing and updating advice presented to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (United States FDA). Almost every month, new information appears about the risks of hypnotics (sleeping pills). This review includes new information on the growing USA overdose epidemic, eight new epidemiologic studies of hypnotics' mortality not available for previous compilations, and new emphasis on risks of short-term hypnotic prescription. The most important risks of hypnotics include excess mortality, especially overdose deaths, quiet deaths at night, infections, cancer, depression and suicide, automobile crashes, falls, and other accidents, and hypnotic-withdrawal insomnia. The short-term use of one-two prescriptions is associated with greater risk per dose than long-term use. Hypnotics are usually prescribed without approved indication, most often with specific contraindications, but even when indicated, there is little or no benefit. The recommended doses objectively increase sleep little if at all, daytime performance is often made worse, not better, and the lack of general health benefits is commonly misrepresented in advertising.

Reports of insomnia were not consistently associated with increased mortality when several factors were controlled; however, men who reported usually sleeping less than 4 hrs were 2.80 times as likely to have died within 6 yrs as men who reported 7.0â€“7.9 hrs of sleep. The ratio for women was 1.48. Men and women who reported sleeping 10 hrs or more had about 1.8 times the mortality of those who reported 7.0â€“7.9 hrs of sleep. Ss who reported using sleeping pills 'often' had 1.5 times the mortality of Ss who 'never' used sleeping pills. These results do not prove that mortality could be reduced by altering sleep durations or by reducing hypnotic prescribing. Rather, studies are needed to determine the causes of these mortality risk factors.

746,Open-label olanzapine treatment in five preadolescent children,"Olanzapine is a recently introduced atypical neuroleptic agent for which little information is available on its use in children. Open clinical trials of olanzapine treatment were conducted on five hospitalized children (ages 6 to 11 years) with varying diagnoses including bipolar disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. Each patient had failed previous psychotropic medication trials, with a mean of four prior trials. The mean length of olanzapine treatment was 32 days (range, 2 to 7 weeks), and mean daily dose was 7.5 mg/day (range, 2.5 to 1.0 mg/day) or 0.22 mg/kg/day (range, 0.12 to 0.29 mg/kg/day). All children experienced adverse effects, including sedation (N = 3), weight gain of up to 16 pounds (N = 3), and akathisia (N = 2). Three patients showed some clinical improvement, but olanzapine treatment was discontinued in all five children within the first 6 weeks of treatment because of adverse effects or lack of clinically significant therapeutic response, although higher (or lower) doses, slower titration of dosage, or a longer duration of treatment might have produced more favorable results. Psychotic symptoms did not respond in the two patients with evidence of overt hallucinations and paranoid ideation. Improvement was observed in sleep in all five patients and in control of aggression in three. Before controlled trials of olanzapine in children are undertaken, further exploration of dose range and increased duration of treatment on an open basis are warranted. Until more encouraging data are available, clinicians should be cautious and conservative in their predictions about the potential value of olanzapine in treating preadolescent psychiatric disorders.;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Mental Disorders/*drug therapy, Pirenzepine/*analogs & derivatives, Akathisia, Drug-Induced/physiopathology, Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/drug therapy, Benzodiazepines, Child, Female, Humans, Impulsive Behavior/drug therapy, Impulsive Behavior/psychology, Male, Mental Disorders/psychology, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/drug therapy, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/psychology, Pirenzepine/adverse effects, Pirenzepine/therapeutic use, Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy, Self-Injurious Behavior/drug therapy, Self-Injurious Behavior/psychology, Tourette Syndrome/drug therapy, Tourette Syndrome/psychology","Krishnamoorthy, J & King, B H",0,746
747,Diagnosis and management of geriatric insomnia: A guide for nurse practitioners,"Purpose: To discuss the assessment, diagnosis, and management of geriatric insomnia, a challenging clinical condition of older adults frequently seen by primary care providers. Data sources: Extensive literature review of the published research articles and textbooks. Conclusions: Complaints of insomnia among older adults are frequently ignored, considered a part of the normal aging process or viewed as a difficult to treat condition. Geriatric insomnia remains a challenge for primary care providers because of the lack of evidence-based clinical guidelines and limited treatment options available. Effective management of this condition is necessary for improved quality of life, which is a primary issue for the elderly and their families. Therefore, geriatric insomnia warrants thorough attention from the nurse practitioners (NPs) who provide care for older adults. Implications for practice: Undiagnosed or under treated insomnia can cause increased risk for falls, motor vehicle accidents, depression, and shorter survival. Insomniacs double their risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and suicide compared to their counterparts. Insomnia is also associated with increased healthcare utilization and institutionalization. NPs could play a central role in reducing the negative consequences of insomnia through a systematic approach for diagnosis, evaluation, and management.

748,Transcranial Sonography Findings in Depression in Association With Psychiatric and Neurologic Diseases: A Review,"The transcranial sonography (TCS) finding of reduced echogenicity of brainstem raphe (hypoechogenic BR) has been associated with depressive states. Here, we review the TCS studies in subjects with depressive disorders and with depression related to degenerative brain diseases, and compare the frequency and clinical correlates of hypoechogenic BR in these reports. Summarizing the data published so far, hypoechogenic BR is present in 67% (range, 37-95%) of depressed but only in 15% (5-36%) of nondepressed subjects without history of neurodegenerative disease. The finding of hypoechogenic BR in these subjects is associated with a relative risk of 3.03 (95% CI, 2.44-3.75; P < .001) of being diagnosed with depression. In patients with Parkinson's disease, hypoechogenic BR is present in 63% (35-92%) of depressed but only in 27% (10-62%) of nondepressed patients, resulting in a relative risk of 2.18 (95% CI, 1.80-2.66; P < .001) of being diagnosed with depression. Hypoechogenic BR is associated with depression in a number of neurological disorders such Huntington's disease, idiopathic Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, myotonic dystrophies, and cerebral small vessel disease. Although some studies did not show any relationship between BR echogenicity and severity of depression, others suggest an association with higher severity of depression, or even with suicidal ideation. In one study BR hypoechogenicity was found to be associated with better responsivity to serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Further studies are warranted to compare the TCS findings of BR alteration with post-mortem histopathological findings, and with genetic variants related to cerebral serotonin metabolism.; Copyright Â© 2016 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.Depressive Disorder/*diagnostic imaging, Neurodegenerative Diseases/*diagnostic imaging, Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial/*methods, Brain Stem/diagnostic imaging, Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases/diagnostic imaging, Depression, Diencephalon/diagnostic imaging, Dominance, Cerebral/physiology, Female, Hepatolenticular Degeneration/diagnostic imaging, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders/diagnostic imaging, Mesencephalon/diagnostic imaging, Multiple Sclerosis/diagnostic imaging, Myotonic Dystrophy/diagnostic imaging, Raphe Nuclei/diagnostic imaging, Reference Values, Statistics as Topic, Suicidal Ideation, Brainstem raphe*, Substantia nigra*, depression*, serotonin*, ultrasound*","Krogias, Christos & Walter, Uwe",0,748
749,"Values, economic estimations, and suicide intent","With reference to the special suicide risk among students, we define four criteria of suicidality: (1) suicide risk, (2) former suicide attempts, (3) prognosis of suicide risk in the future, (4) total scores of the FBS, a German questionnaire to assess suicide risk. The sample consists of 300 students, clients of a therapeutic counseling center. The statistical method is the multiple regression analysis. The predictors are sociobiography, personality tests (Giessen-Test, Hope Scale), estimations of economic conditions in the future with respect to general or personal loss of work, and preference of values, whether oriented more toward idealistic or materialistic values. The results show that the described parts of common variance between the criteria and the predictors differ from 35% (prognosis) and 54% (total score of the FBS). In between are suicide attempts (38%) and suicide ideas (45%). --Suicide ideas. The value preferences have a prominent part in the explanation of suicide ideas. The difference between individual idealistic values and materialistic preferences of society are responsible for this. --Former suicide attempts. Personality aspects and perspectives of the future have nearly the same weight. Less social potency, stronger feelings of insufficiency, and higher potential of aggression indicate the personality of persons with former suicide attempts. Unfavorable chances of getting work and negative expectations of the future are signs of a significant pessimism. --Prognosis by therapists. A poor prognosis is defined by certain personality aspects (self-insufficiency, dominance, less initiative), denial of value preferences and symptoms like sleeping and achievement disorders, free-floating anxiety, and more positive estimations of employment data. --FBS total score.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS); Social Values*, Socioeconomic Factors*, Students/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Personality Tests, Risk Factors, Suicide, Attempted/psychology","Kuda, M.",0,749

751,"Estimating the magnitude of the relation between bullying, e-bullying, and suicidal behaviors among United States youth, 2015","Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among US adolescents aged 12â€“19 years. Researchers would benefit from a better understanding of the direct effects of bullying and e-bullying on adolescent suicide to inform intervention work. Aims: To explore the direct and indirect effects of bullying and e-bullying on adolescent suicide attempts (SAs) and to estimate the magnitude of these effects controlling for significant covariates. Method: This study uses data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS), a nationally representative sample of US high school youth. We quantified the association between bullying and the likelihood of SA, after adjusting for covariates (i.e., sexual orientation, obesity, sleep, etc.) identified with the PC algorithm. Results: Bullying and e-bullying were significantly associated with SA in logistic regression analyses. Bullying had an estimated average causal effect (ACE) of 2.46%, while e-bullying had an ACE of 4.16%. Limitations: Data are cross-sectional and temporal precedence is not known. Conclusion: These findings highlight the strong association between bullying, e-bullying, and SA.

752,"Burnout and Doctors: Prevalence, Prevention and Intervention","Doctors are exposed to high levels of stress in the course of their profession and are particularly susceptible to experiencing burnout. Burnout has far-reaching implications on doctors; patients and the healthcare system. Doctors experiencing burnout are reported to be at a higher risk of making poor decisions; display hostile attitude toward patients; make more medical errors; and have difficult relationships with co-workers. Burnout among doctors also increases risk of depression; anxiety; sleep disturbances; fatigue; alcohol and drug misuse; marital dysfunction; premature retirement and perhaps most seriously suicide. Sources of stress in medical practice may range from the emotions arising in the context of patient care to the environment in which doctors practice. The extent of burnout may vary depending on the practice setting; speciality and changing work environment. Understanding dynamic risk factors associated with burnout may help us develop strategies for preventing and treating burnout. Some of these strategies will be reviewed in this paper.; burnout, compassion fatigue, resilience, work engagement, workplace stress","Kumar, Shailesh",0,752

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalences and patterns of smart device activities and the purposes and perceived outcomes related to smart device use, and the differences in patterns of smart device activities between adolescents who did and did not perceive these outcomes. The study was a cross-sectional survey of Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. Demographic characteristics, purpose and pattern of the activities, and frequencies of the outcomes were measured. Data from 960 adolescents aged 10-19 were analyzed. Nearly 86% of the sample use smart device daily. The one-week prevalence of perceived sleep deprivation, eye discomfort, musculoskeletal discomfort, family conflict and cyberbullying victimization related to smart device use were nearly 50%, 45%, 40%, 20% and 5% respectively. More than 25% of the respondents were at risk of negative outcomes related to smart device activities for more than 1 h per day, browsing and gaming on at least 4 days per week and watching TV/movies and posting on more than 2 days per week.

754,Does the duration and time of sleep increase the risk of allergic rhinitis? Results of the 6-year nationwide Korea youth risk behavior web-based survey,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common chronic disorder in the pediatric population. Although several studies have investigated the correlation between AR and sleep-related issues, the association between the duration and time of sleep and AR has not been analyzed in long-term national data. This study investigated the relationship between sleep time and duration and AR risk in middle- and high-school students (adolescents aged 12-18). We analyzed national data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2007-2012. The sample size was 274,480, with an average response rate of 96.2%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between sleep and AR risk. Furthermore, to determine the best-fitted model among independent variables such as sleep duration, sleep time, and the combination of sleep duration and sleep time, we used Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to compare models. A total of 43,337 boys and 41,665 girls reported a diagnosis of AR at baseline. The odds ratio increased with age and with higher education and economic status of the parents. Further, students in mid-sized and large cities had stronger relationships to AR than those in small cities. In both genders, AR was associated with depression and suicidal ideation. In the analysis of sleep duration and sleep time, the odds ratio increased in both genders when sleep duration was <7 hours, and when the time of sleep was later than 24:00 hours. Our results indicate an association between sleep time and duration and AR. This study is the first to focus on the relationship between sleep duration and time and AR in national survey data collected over 6 years.;Data Collection*, Depression*/microbiology, Depression*/physiopathology, Depression*/psychology, Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial*/epidemiology, Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial*/physiopathology, Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial*/psychology, Risk-Taking*, Sleep*, Suicidal Ideation*, Adolescent, Age Factors, Child, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Internet, Male, Republic of Korea/epidemiology, Rhinitis, Allergic, Socioeconomic Factors, Time Factors","Kwon, Jeoung A; Lee, Minjee; Yoo, Ki-Bong & Park, Eun-Cheol",0,754

Thirty-six depressed in- and outpatients aged 65 years or more, diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria, were evaluated using the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD). After 6 weeks of Fluoxetine treatment (20-40 mg/day), patients were classified as responders"" and ""non responders."" For the HRSD both overall scoring and the scores for specific symptomatologic clusters were analyzed in a statistical model comprising the stepwise regression analysis and the exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation. Among responders five variables (thought disturbance suicide sleep disturbance agitation and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) accounted for almost 80% of the total variability. Furthermore factor analysis extracted two factors: the first was dominated by the suicide sleep disturbance and agitation clusters; the second weighted on thought disturbance and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. As in the younger population symptoms related to a 5-HT dysfunction appear to act as predictors of the favorable response to Fluoxetine in geriatric depression as well.

756,The epidemiology of pain in depression,"Over 75% of depressed patients in primary care complain of painful physical symptoms such as headache, stomach pain, neck and back pain as well as non-specific generalized pain. The presence of such symptoms predicts a greater severity and a less favourable outcome of depression with a poorer health-related quality of life. World Health Organization data obtained in primary care centres worldwide show that 22% of all primary care patients suffer from persistent debilitating pain and that these patients are four times more likely to have co-morbid anxiety or depressive disorder than pain-free primary care patients. Not unexpectedly, the risk of depression is greater when the pain is more diffuse, as indicated by the number of painful sites, and has a greater effect on the quality of life. Certain depressive symptoms, such as low energy and sleep disturbances, are commonly found in patients with co-morbid pain, whereas the opposite is true for symptoms such as guilt and loneliness. Increasingly, major depression is seen as being composed of psychological, somatic and painful physical symptoms. In order to achieve full sustained remission it is necessary to treat symptoms in all three of these areas. The area of painful physical symptoms is unfortunately still poorly understood and clearly merits greater attention.; 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Depression/*physiopathology, Pain/*epidemiology, Chronic Disease, Humans, Suicide, Attempted","LÃ©pine, Jean-Pierre & Briley, Mike",0,756
757,The fenfluramine challenge test in the affective spectrum: a possible marker of endogeneity and severity,"In order to investigate the role of serotonergic mechanisms in depressive disorders, the fenfluramine challenge test was performed in 31 patients suffering from different types of depression. The strategy was to select a simple method (i.e., easier to perform than CSF studies for instance) to be applied to a wide range of patients, as close as possible to everyday cases in a clinical setting (i.e., not only to such severe or highly selected groups as is normally the case in biological research in psychiatry). The neuroendocrine test (which consisted of the measurement of variations in the secretion of prolactin, growth hormone and Cortisol after the administration of 60 mg dl-fenfluramine p. o.) did not correlate with symptoms of behavior patterns previously identified with a serotonin deficit"" (i. e. suicidal behavior or attempts lowering of the control of impulses sleep disturbances) but only with the severity of the diagnosis (in the DSM-III hierarchical scale) or with indexes of endogeneity (Newcastle scale). This fact could be explained by methodological artifacts (i. e. dlfenfluramine is not a clean probe showing influence in the dopamine and noradrenaline metabolism; the absorption of fenfluramine was not controlled) or by the fact that the involvement of serotonin in affective disorders is not a selective isolated dysfunction but is integrated in more complex interrelationships. Nevertheless our preliminary findings (even without the results of the comparison with a control group and the evaluation of a few more data and cases) do coincide with the absence of predictors or the lack of specific patterns of response of symptoms with new selective re-uptake blockers of serotonin antidepressants.;""Accession Number: 3283785.

758,"Perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation in patients with fibromyalgia and healthy subjects: a cross-sectional study","Perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness are key factors in the development of suicidal behaviors that have been frequently observed among patients with fibromyalgia. The aim of the present study was to compare these two factors in patients with fibromyalgia with and without suicidal ideation and healthy subjects. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the relationship between these two factors and the secondary variables included in the study, such as depression, sleep quality or the degree of marital adjustment. Perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were assessed with the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, depression and suicidal ideation with the Patients Health Questionnaire-9, suicidal risk with the Plutchik Suicide Risk scale, sleep with the Insomnia Severity Index, and marital adjustment with the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment scale. Questionnaire scores were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test. 49 healthy subjects, 38 patients with fibromyalgia without suicidal ideation and 15 patients with fibromyalgia and suicidal ideations were included. Perceived burdensomeness scores were significantly higher in patients with suicidal ideation than in patients without suicidal ideation and controls; thwarted belongingness scores were significantly higher in patients with suicidal ideation than in controls. Marital adjustment was also significantly poor in patients with suicidal ideation than in patients without suicidal ideation and controls. Among patients with fibromyalgia, perceived burdensomeness seems to be strongly related with suicidal ideation, whereas thwarted belongingness seems to play a less relevant role at this respect. Poor marital adjustment could be related with depression.; Interpersonal Relations*, Suicidal Ideation*, Fibromyalgia/*psychology, Case-Control Studies, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Fibromyalgia, Marital adjustment, Perceived burdensomeness, Suicidal ideation, Thwarted belongingness","Lafuente-Castro, Cristina P.; OrdoÃ±ez-Carrasco, Jorge L.; Garcia-Leiva, Juan M.; Salgueiro-Macho, Monika & Calandre, Elena P.",0,758
759,Familiality and clinical outcomes of sleep disturbances in major depressive and bipolar disorders,"Objective: Sleep disturbances are frequently observed in major depressive (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). This study reported sleep profiles of patients and their relatives versus controls, and examined the familiality of sleep features in mood disorder families. We also evaluated the influences of sleep disturbance on patients' quality of life (QOL), functional impairment, and suicidality. Methods: We recruited 363 BD and 157MDD patients, 521 first-degree relatives, and 235 healthy controls,which completed a diagnostic interview, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and QOL questionnaire. The magnitude of heritability of sleep features was calculated and familiality was evaluated by mixed regression models and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The associations between sleep problems and clinical outcomes were examined using multiple regression models. Results: More than three-quarters of mildly-ill patients were classified as â€œpoor sleepersâ€. MDD patients had significantly worse sleep quality as compared to BD patients.Moderate but significant familial aggregation was observed in subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, disturbance, daytime dysfunction, and global score (ICC = 0.10-0.21, P < .05). Significant heritability was found in sleep quality (0.45, P < .001) and sleep disturbance (0.23, P < .001). Patients with good sleep quality had better QOL and less functional impairment (P < .05) than poor sleepers. Poor sleep quality and nightmares further increased the risk for suicidal ideation (ORadj = 2.8) and suicide attempts (ORadj = 1.9-2.8). Conclusion: Subjectively measured sleep features demonstrated significant familiality. Poor sleep quality further impaired patients' daily function and QOL, in addition to increasing the risk of suicidality, and thus requires special attention in related clinical settings.

760,Acute impact of caffeinated alcoholic beverages on cognition: A systematic review,"Introduction: Energy drinks are popular beverages that are supposed to counteract sleepiness, increase energy, maintain alertness and reduce symptoms of hangover. Cognitive enhancing seems to be related to many compounds such as caffeine, taurine and vitamins. Currently, users mostly combine psychostimulant effects of energy drinks to counteract sedative effects of alcohol. However, recent literature suggests that this combination conducts to feel less intoxicated but still impaired. The goal of the present article is to review cognitive impact and subjective awareness in case of caffeinated alcoholic beverage (CAB) intoxication. Method: PubMed (January 1960 to March 2016) database was searched using the following terms: cognitive impairments, alcohol, energy drinks; cognition, alcohol, caffeine. Results: 99 papers were found but only 12 randomized controlled studies which explored cognitive disorders and subjective awareness associated with acute CAB or AED (alcohol associated with energy drinks) intoxication were included. Discussion: The present literature review confirmed that energy drinks might counteract some cognitive deficits and adverse effects of alcohol i.e. dry mouth, fatigue, headache, weakness, and perception of intoxication due to alcohol alone. This effect depends on alcohol limb but disappears when the complexity of the task increases, when driving for example. Moreover, studies clearly showed that CAB/AEDs increase impulsivity which conducts to an overconsumption of alcohol and enhanced motivation to drink compared to alcohol alone, potentiating the risk of developing addictive behaviors. This is a huge problem in adolescents with high impulsivity and immature decision making processes. Conclusion: Although energy drinks counteract some cognitive deficits due to alcohol alone, their association promotes the risk of developing alcohol addiction. As a consequence, it is necessary to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these interactions in order to better prevent the development of alcohol dependence.

761,Attempted infanticide and suicide inaugurating catatonia associated with Hashimotos encephalopathy: A case report,"Background: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome with motor and behavioural symptoms. Though usually occuring in patients with schizophrenia and mood disorders, this syndrome may also be associated with neurological diseases or general medical conditions. Few cases of catatonia associated with autoimmune disorders have been described. Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a 27-year-old woman diagnosed with Hashimotoâ€™s encephalitis (HE) who attempted suicide and infanticide by defenestration. As she presented risk factors for postpartum psychosis, she was treated principally with antipsychotics. Despite adequate treatment for psychosis, symptoms worsened and she developed catatonia. Complementary investigations showed elevated titres of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (200 and 10 times, respectively, as compared to normal levels) and electroencephalography were suggestive of encephalopathy. In the presence of an otherwise unexplained neuropsychiatric condition, HE was suspected and oral prednisolone was introduced. Psychiatric symptoms improved dramatically within 72 h and the patient was still free of any symptom 3 years later. Conclusion: Catatonia of organic aetiology should always be considered before a psychiatric aetiology especially in case of clinical worsening in spite of adequate psychotropic treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first description of catatonia associated with HE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

762,"Suicidal ideation, antidepressive medication and car crash injury","Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between suicidal ideation, antidepressive medication and the risk of a car crash resulting in serious injury. Design: This was a population-based case-control study. Cases were car drivers who were involved in crashes in which at least one occupant of their car was hospitalised or killed. Controls were selected using a cluster random sample of car drivers on the roads in the same region. Self-reported information on suicidal ideation in the 12 months prior to the crash or roadside survey, current usage of antidepressive medication as well as other crash-related risk factors was obtained from the drivers, or by proxy, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Setting: The study was conducted in the Auckland region of New Zealand in 1998 and 1999. Results: There was a significant association between drivers who had suicidal ideation but without current antidepressive medication and the risk of an injury crash (OR = 4.16, 95% CI = 2.14-8.10), when compared to drivers without any suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The risk of an injury crash was significantly increased for those drivers who reported to have previous or current suicidal ideation but without current antidepressant medication.

763,Children's physical health complaints after exposure to intimate partner violence,"Objectives: A clear association between exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and children's physical health is still not well determined, because adverse effects might be explained by the confounding detrimental effects of other traumatic experiences. This study investigated whether children exposed to IPV have higher risks for physical health complaints compared to children in a general population sample. Second, health complaint differences were explored between IPV witnesses and those who in addition experienced other forms of abuse or neglect.; Design: Risk estimates for 21 everyday physical health complaints were made for children exposed to IPV compared to a general population sample using odds ratios.; Methods: Primary caregivers of 275 child witnesses of IPV (6-12 years of age) referred to several specialized mental health or child welfare institutes throughout the Netherlands (2004-2009) reported on children's somatic complaints using 21 items of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) reflecting sleeping, eating, pain complaints, and self-harm.; Results: Compared to a population sample (n= 903), child witnesses more often experienced health complaints, in particular, more eating, sleeping, and pain problems and more self-harm. Few differences in health complaints were found between child witnesses with and without additional adverse experiences of maltreatment.; Conclusions: The degree of physical health complaints in children exposed to IPV is considerable, whether or not they were also victims of other forms of abuse. Early attention to everyday health complaints in children exposed to IPV might prevent more serious health problems in adolescence and adulthood.; Â©2012 The British Psychological Society.Domestic Violence*, Health Status*, Parent-Child Relations*, Child, Child Welfare, Crime Victims, Female, Humans, Male, Netherlands/epidemiology, Odds Ratio, Pain/epidemiology, Risk, Self-Injurious Behavior/epidemiology, Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology","Lamers-Winkelman, Francien; De Schipper, J Clasien & Oosterman, Mirjam",0,763
764,Nightmares and suicide risk in psychiatric patients: The roles of hopelessness and male depressive symptoms,"Although nightmares have been shown to increase the risk for suicide, less is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. In order to address this gap and guided by the hopelessness theory of suicide risk, we examined hopelessness and male depressive symptoms as risk factors for suicide while considering the frequency of and impairment due to nightmares. Data were collected from 172 psychiatrically hospitalized, adult patients (91 women, 81 men) with an average age of 39.15 (SD = 13.48) years. Patients were administered self-report measures of nightmare frequency/impairment, hopelessness, and male depressive symptoms, as well as undergoing a fully structured diagnostic clinical interview to determine diagnoses and suicide risk. Compared to patients with yearly or no nightmares, those with monthly or weekly nightmares reported nightmares reported higher levels of hopelessness, male depressive symptoms, and suicide risk. Male depressive symptoms significantly mediated the relation between hopelessness and suicide risk in patients who reported monthly to weekly nightmares, but not in those who reported yearly or no nightmares. Moreover, impairment due to nightmares was significantly and positively associated with male depression, but not hopelessness or suicide risk. The results also provide evidence and further understanding about possible mechanisms of emerging suicide.

765,Functional Connectivity Density Mapping of Depressive Symptoms and Loneliness in Non-Demented Elderly Male,"Background: Depression and loneliness are prevalent and highly correlated phenomena among the elderly and influence both physical and mental health. Brain functional connectivity changes associated with depressive symptoms and loneliness are not fully understood.; Methods: A cross-sectional functional MRI study was conducted among 85 non-demented male elders. Geriatric depression scale-short form (GDS) and loneliness scale were used to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms and loneliness, respectively. Whole brain voxel-wise resting-state functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping was performed to delineate short-range FCD (SFCD) and long-range FCD (LFCD). Regional correlations between depressive symptoms or loneliness and SFCD or LFCD were examined using general linear model (GLM), with age incorporated as a covariate and depressive symptoms and loneliness as predictors.; Results: Positive correlations between depressive symptoms and LFCD were observed in left rectal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, right supraorbital gyrus, and left inferior temporal gyrus. Positive correlations between depressive symptoms and SFCD were observed in left middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral superior medial frontal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and left middle occipital region. Positive correlations between SFCD and loneliness were centered over bilateral lingual gyrus.; Conclusion: Depressive symptoms are associated with FCD changes over frontal and temporal regions, which may involve the cognitive control, affective regulation, and default mode networks. Loneliness is associated with FCD changes in bilateral lingual gyri that are known to be important in social cognition. Depressive symptoms and loneliness may be associated with different brain regions in non-demented elderly male.; brain imaging, depressive symptoms, elderly, functional connectivity density, loneliness","Lan, Chen-Chia; Tsai, Shih-Jen; Huang, Chu-Chung; Wang, Ying-Hsiu; Chen, Tong-Ru; Yeh, Heng-Liang; Liu, Mu-En; Lin, Ching-Po & Yang, Albert C.",0,765
766,Increased risk of a suicide event in patients with primary fibromyalgia and in fibromyalgia patients with concomitant comorbidities: A nationwide population-based cohort study,"An increased risk of suicide ideation and death has been reported in patients with fibromyalgia. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of a suicide event in patients with primary fibromyalgia and in fibromyalgia patients with comorbidities. We used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, a subset of the national insurance claim dataset, which enrolled 1 million Taiwanese people from 2000 to 2005, to identify 95,150 patients with incident fibromyalgia (ICD-9-CM 729.0-729.1) and 190,299 reference subjects matched by sex, age, and index date of diagnosis, with a mean of 8.46â€ŠÂ±â€Š2.37 years of follow-up until 2011. The risk of a suicide event (ICD-9-CM, External-Cause Codes 950-959) was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. Stratification analysis was performed by separating fibromyalgia patients and reference subjects with respect to each comorbidity to determine the risk of suicide in fibromyalgia patients with or without comorbidity relative to subjects who had neither fibromyalgia nor comorbidity. In this Taiwanese dataset, there were 347 suicide events in patients with fibromyalgia (4.16 per 10 person-years) and 424 in matched reference subjects (2.63 per 10 person-years) with a significant crude hazard ratio (HR) of 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-1.83) and an adjusted HR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.17-1.71) for fibromyalgia patients relative to the matched reference subjects. According to the 2â€ŠÃ—â€Š2 stratification analysis, we found that fibromyalgia patients without comorbidity had an independent but mild risk of a suicide event with adjusted HRs ranging from 1.33 to 1.69 relative to subjects with neither fibromyalgia nor comorbidity. Meanwhile, fibromyalgia patients with comorbidity led to a markedly enhanced risk of a suicide event relative to the matched reference subjects, with adjusted HRs ranging from 1.51 to 8.23. Our analysis confirmed a mild-to-moderate risk of a suicide event in patients with primary fibromyalgia.

The author reviewed the standardized tests results from 39 active duty service members, all of whom had recent deployments to either Iraq or Afghanistan. The battery of self-test instruments assessed the effects of military trauma, anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and insomnia. Among the study subjects, the entire group reported significant sleep problems, with bedtime arousals impeding sleep initiation. Male subjects' reported an average AUDIT score of 8.62. Service members with higher trauma scores also reported greater misuse of alcohol. The high trauma scores also correlated with specific pre-sleep cognitive and somatic factors. The findings of this study lend support for the use of standardized instruments for assessing sleep problems, along with similar tests for trauma and substance misuse, which together should help identify high risk military patients.;Alcoholism/*epidemiology, Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*epidemiology, Adult, Afghan Campaign 2001-, Alcoholism/complications, Alcoholism/diagnosis, Diagnostic Self Evaluation, Female, Humans, Iraq War, 2003-2011, Male, Military Personnel/psychology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/complications, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diagnosis, Suicidal Ideation","Lande, R Gregory",1,767
768,Randomized controlled trial of acceptance and commitment therapy for distress and impairment in OEF/OIF/OND veterans,"Objective: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a widely utilized psychotherapeutic approach, but randomized, controlled studies are lacking in veterans. This study evaluated the efficacy of ACT for emotional distress among veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Method: One hundred sixty veterans (80% male, Mage = 34 years) with anxiety or depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) were randomized to ACT or present-centered therapy (PCT) and assessed before, during, and after treatment and during 3- to 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome was general distress as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventoryâ€“18 Global Severity Index. Additional outcomes included symptomatology, disability, quality of life, acceptability, and satisfaction. Results: There was improvement following treatment in the whole sample across a variety of measures, including general distress (d = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.52, 0.96]) and functioning (d = 0.71, 95% CI [0.50, 0.93]) and moderate to high levels of satisfaction with treatment. Response to the 2 interventions did not differ on the primary outcome or most secondary outcomes, although ACT led to greater improvement in insomnia than did PCT (ds = 0.63 and 0.08, respectively). Treatment dropout did not differ by condition but was high (41.9%). Conclusions: ACTâ€™s efficacy in this group was modest and generally did not differ from that for PCT. Additional work is needed to understand the reasons that ACT did not perform as well as predicted in this veteran sample.

769,Sleep disturbance interventions in oncology patients and family caregivers: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis,"Sleep disturbance is a significant problem for both oncology patients and family caregivers (FCs), and is associated with poorer functional status, quality of life, and potentially disease progression. This review describes a comprehensive literature search and meta-analysis of the efficacy of interventions for sleep disturbance in oncology patients and their FCs. This search revealed 47 studies that evaluated the effects of a number of interventions on sleep disturbance/sleep quality, as a primary or secondary outcome in oncology patients. The primary purposes of the review were to synthesize findings from intervention studies for sleep disturbance in oncology patients and their FCs; to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions; to identify gaps in the literature; and to provide directions for future research. In addition, all 47 intervention studies were evaluated in terms of key intervention and study characteristics. Both strong patterns and inconsistencies were identified among the studies, which complicate an evaluation of the efficacy of interventions, and may collectively guide future research. Finally, the importance of including the FC in sleep disturbance interventions is discussed. In light of the detrimental effects that sleep disturbance has on both the patient and the FC, this systematic review may better inform essential future intervention efforts.

770,Unresolved grief in a national sample of bereaved parents: impaired mental and physical health 4 to 9 years later,"Purpose: To assess unresolved parental grief, the associated long-term impact on mental and physical health, and health service use.; Patients and Methods: This anonymous, mail-in questionnaire study was performed as a population-based investigation in Sweden between August 2001 and October 2001. Four hundred forty-nine parents who lost a child as a result of cancer 4 to 9 years earlier completed the survey (response rate, 80%). One hundred ninety-one (43%) of the bereaved parents were fathers, and 251 (56%) were mothers. Bereaved parents were asked whether or not, and to what extent, they had worked through their grief. They were also asked about their physical and psychological well-being. For outcomes of interest, we report relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs as well as unadjusted odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios.; Results: Parents with unresolved grief reported significantly worsening psychological health (fathers: RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.4; mothers: RR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.4) and physical health (fathers: RR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8 to 4.4; mothers: RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.3) compared with those who had worked through their grief. Fathers with unresolved grief also displayed a significantly higher risk of sleep difficulties (RR, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.5 to 17.8). Mothers, however, reported increased visits with physicians during the previous 5 years (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.6) as well as a greater likelihood of taking sick leave when they had not worked through their grief (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.5).; Conclusion: Parents who have not worked through their grief are at increased risk of long-term mental and physical morbidity, increased health service use, and increased sick leave.;Bereavement*, Grief*, Parents/*psychology, Adaptation, Psychological, Adolescent, Adult, Fathers/psychology, Female, Health Services/utilization, Health Status, Humans, Male, Mental Health, Mothers/psychology, Neoplasms, Surveys and Questionnaires, Sweden, Time Factors","Lannen, Patrizia K; Wolfe, Joanne; Prigerson, Holly G; Onelov, Erik & Kreicbergs, Ulrika C",0,770
771,"Daily hassles, physical illness, and sleep problems in older adults with wishes to die","Background: Factors associated with the wish to die should be investigated in order to gain more opportunities for preventive interventions targeting older adults at risk for suicide. The goal of the research was to study the prevalence and associated factors of wishes to die in older adults living in the community using the data from a survey on the prevalence of mental disorders in this population. Methods: With a representative sample of community living older adults aged 65 years and over (N = 2777), we compared individuals with the wish to die (n = 163) to those without the wish to die on the basis of the presence and severity of daily hassles, physical illness, and sleep quality. Results: Logistic regression revealed that when depression and sociodemographic variables were held constant, self-rated physical health, number of chronic illnesses, number and intensity of daily hassles, as well as sleep problems were significantly associated with the wish to die in older adults. Painful illnesses and daytime dysfunction due to sleep problems were also associated factors with the wish to die. Conclusion: Since desire for death is the first step into the suicidal process, health professionals should seriously consider the important and unique contribution of these variables in order to have more opportunities for detection and intervention.

773,Angelman syndrome in adulthood,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder. The goal of this study was to investigate the primary health issues affecting adults with AS and to further characterize the natural history and genotype-phenotype correlations. Standardized phone interviews with caregivers for 110 adolescents and adults with AS were conducted. The impact of age, sex, and genotype on specific outcomes in neurology, orthopedics, internal medicine, and psychiatry were investigated. The mean age of individuals with AS was 24 years (range 16-50y). Active seizures were present in 41% of individuals, and 72% had sleep dysfunction. Significant constipation was present in 85%, and 32% were overweight or obese, with obesity disproportionately affecting women. Scoliosis affected 50% with a mean age at diagnosis of 12 years, and 24% of those diagnosed with scoliosis required surgery, an intervention disproportionately affecting men. Sixty-eight percent were able to walk independently, and 13% were able to speak 5 or more words. Self-injurious behavior was exhibited in 52% of individuals. The results of this study indicate that epilepsy severity may assume a bimodal age distribution: seizures are typically most severe in early childhood but may recur in adulthood. While late-adolescent and adult sleep patterns were improved when compared to the degree of sleep dysfunction present during infancy and childhood, the prevalence of poor sleep in adults remained quite high.

775,Development and content validity of a patient reported outcomes measure to assess symptoms of major depressive disorder,"Background: Although many symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are assessed through patient-report, there are currently no patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments that incorporate documented evidence of patient input in PRO instrument development. A review of existing PROs used in MDD suggested the need to conduct qualitative research with patients with MDD to better understand their experience of MDD and develop an evaluative instrument with content validity. The aim of this study was to develop a disease-specific questionnaire to assess symptoms important and relevant to adult MDD patients. Methods: The questionnaire development involved qualitative interviews for concept elicitation, instrument development, and cognitive interviews to support content validity. For concept elicitation, ten MDD severity specific focus group interviews with thirty-eight patients having clinician-confirmed diagnoses of MDD were conducted in January 2009. A semi-structured discussion guide was used to elicit patientsâ€™ spontaneous descriptions of MDD symptoms. Verbatim transcripts of focus groups were coded and analyzed to develop a conceptual framework to describe MDD. A PRO instrument was developed by operationalizing concepts elicited in the conceptual framework. Cognitive interviews were carried out in patients (n = 20) to refine and test the content validity of the instrument in terms of item relevance and comprehension, instructions, recall period, and response categories. Results: Concept elicitation focus groups identified thirty-five unique concepts falling into several domains: i) emotional, ii) cognitive, iii) motivation, iv) work, v) sleep, vi) appetite, vii) social, viii) activities of daily living, ix) tired/ fatigue, x) body pain, and xi) suicidality. Concept saturation, the point at which no new relevant information emerges in later interviews, was achieved for each of the concepts. Based on the qualitative findings, the PRO instrument developed had 15 daily and 20 weekly items. The cognitive interviews confirmed that the instructions, item content, and response scales were understood by the patients. Conclusions: Rigorous qualitative research resulted in the development of a PRO measure for MDD with supported content validity. The MDD PRO can assist in understanding and assessing MDD symptoms from patientsâ€™ perspectives as well as evaluating treatment benefit of new targeted therapies.

777,The neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's disease,"The neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its correlates are reviewed. Dementia occurs in up to 30% and can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. Cognitive impairments involve executive, visuospatial, attentional, and memory dysfunctions. Apathy may respond to dopamine agonists or cholines-terase inhibitors. Cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression predict quality of life. Visual hallucinations and paranoia are common, and respond to low dose clozapine. Depression is common and predicts caregiver burden and depression. The best data suggest the efficacy of nortriptyline and the safety of SSRIs. Anxiety disorders occur in 40% of patients, especially off-period panic attacks and specific phobias. Bromazepam has proven useful for anxiety in PD, but buspirone has only diminished drug-induced dyskinesias to date. Sleep disorders occur in up to 94% of patients. Insomnia is common and is treated by dopaminergic agent dose reduction, nocturnal dosing, treatment of depression, or use of short half-lived hypnotics, depending on etiology. Parasomnias include REM behavior disorder and vivid dreams and nightmares. Excessive daytime somnolence occurs in at least 15% of patients. Sleep attacks are common and patients should be warned about driving when taking dopamine agonists. Sexual disorders occur in most patients. Paraphilias are associated with dopamine agonists, and clozapine may be useful in their treatment. Surgical therapies are associated with a wide variety of neuropsychiatric features, and vigilance for suicide attempts with subthalamic nucleus stimulation seems warranted. Neuropsychiatric disorders are important determinants of quality of life and caregiver burden in PD.

778,Fluorinated Sterols Are Suicide Inhibitors of Ergosterol Biosynthesis and Growth in Trypanosoma brucei,"Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent for sleeping sickness, depends on ergosterol for growth. Here, we describe the effects of a mechanism-based inhibitor, 26-fluorolanosterol (26FL), which converts inÂ vivo to a fluorinated substrate of the sterol C24-methyltransferase essential for sterol methylation and function of ergosterol, and missing from the human host. 26FL showed potent inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis and growth of procyclic and bloodstream forms while having no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis or growth of human epithelial kidney cells. During exposure of cloned TbSMT to 26-fluorocholesta-5,7,24-trienol, the enzyme is gradually killed as a consequence of the covalent binding of the intermediate C25 cation to the active site (kcat/kinactÂ = 0.26Â min(-1)/0.24Â min(-1); partition ratio of 1.08), whereas 26FL is non-productively bound.

779,Can bipolar disorder be viewed as a multi-system inflammatory disease?,"Background: Patients with bipolar disorder are known to be at high risk of premature death. Comorbid cardio-vascular diseases are a leading cause of excess mortality, well above the risk associated with suicide. In this review, we explore comorbid medical disorders, highlighting evidence that bipolar disorder can be effectively conceptualized as a multi-systemic inflammatory disease. Methods: We conducted a systematic PubMed search of all English-language articles recently published with bipolar disorder cross-referenced with the following terms: mortality and morbidity, cardio-vascular, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, auto-antibody, retro-virus, stress, sleep and circadian rhythm. Results: Evidence gathered so far suggests that the multi-system involvement is present from the early stages, and therefore requires proactive screening and diagnostic procedures, as well as comprehensive treatment to reduce progression and premature mortality. Exploring the biological pathways that could account for the observed link show that dysregulated inflammatory background could be a common factor underlying cardio-vascular and bipolar disorders. Viewing bipolar disorder as a multi-system disorder should help us to re-conceptualize disorders of the mind as â€œdisorders of the brain and the bodyâ€. Limitations: The current literature substantially lacks longitudinal and mechanistic studies, as well as comparison studies to explore the magnitude of the medical burden in bipolar disorder compared to major mood disorders as well as psychotic disorders. It is also necessary to look for subgroups of bipolar disorder based on their rates of comorbid disorders. Conclusions: Comorbid medical illnesses in bipolar disorder might be viewed not only as the consequence of health behaviors and of psychotropic medications, but rather as an early manifestation of a multi-systemic disorder. Medical monitoring is thus a critical component of case assessment. Exploring common biological pathways of inflammation should help biomarkers discovery, ultimately leading to innovative diagnostic tools, new methods of prevention and personalized treatments.

780,The effectiveness of acupuncture research across components of the trauma spectrum response (tsr): a systematic review of reviews,"Background: Co-morbid symptoms (for example, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and fatigue) are particularly common in military fighters returning from the current conflicts, who have experienced physical and/or psychological trauma. These overlapping conditions cut across the boundaries of mind, brain and body, resulting in a common symptomatic and functional spectrum of physical, cognitive, psychological and behavioral effects referred to as the 'Trauma Spectrum Response' (TSR). While acupuncture has been shown to treat some of these components effectively, the current literature is often difficult to interpret, inconsistent or of variable quality. Thus, to gauge comprehensively the effectiveness of acupuncture across TSR components, a systematic review of reviews was conducted using the Samueli Institute's Rapid Evidence Assessment of the Literature (REALÂ©) methodology.; Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, CIHL, and PsycInfo were searched from inception to September 2011 for systematic reviews/meta-analyses. Quality assessment was rigorously performed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN 50) checklist and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Adherence to the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials in Acupuncture (STRICTA) criteria was also assessed.; Results: Of the 1,480 citations identified by our searches, 52 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, all high quality except for one, met inclusion criteria for each TSR component except post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sexual function. The majority of reviews addressed most STRICTA components, but did not describe safety.; Conclusions: Based on the results of our review, acupuncture appears to be effective for treating headaches and, although more research is needed, seems to be a promising treatment option for anxiety, sleep disturbances, depression and chronic pain. It does not, however, demonstrate any substantial treatment benefit for substance abuse. Because there were no reviews on PTSD or sexual function that met our pre-defined inclusion criteria, we cannot comment on acupuncture's effectiveness in treating these conditions. More quality data are also needed to determine whether acupuncture is appropriate for treating fatigue or cognitive difficulties. Further, while acupuncture has been shown to be generally safe, safety was not described in the majority of studies, making it difficult to provide any strong recommendations. Future research should address safety reporting in detail in order to increase our confidence in acupuncture's efficacy across the identified TSR components.;Acupuncture Therapy/*methods, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*therapy, Combat Disorders/therapy, Humans, Military Personnel, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Lee, Courtney; Crawford, Cindy; Wallerstedt, Dawn; York, Alexandra; Duncan, Alaine; Smith, Jennifer; Sprengel, Meredith; Welton, Richard & Jonas, Wayne",0,780
781,Risk Factors for Suicidal Ideation among Patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,"Objective: Chronic pain frequently coexists with psychiatric symptoms in patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Previous studies have shown a relationship between CRPS and the risk of suicide. The purpose of this study was to assess risk factors for suicidal ideation in patients with CRPS.; Methods: Based on criteria established by the International Association for the Study of Pain, 39 patients diagnosed with CRPS Type 1 or Type 2 were enrolled in this study. Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 3 of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and symptoms of pain were evaluated using the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Psychiatric symptoms were assessed in using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-I, SCID-II), the HAMD, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).; Results: Twenty-nine patients (74.4%) were at high risk and 10 (25.6%) were at low risk for suicidal ideation. Risk factors significantly associated with suicidal ideation included depression (p=0.002), severity of pain (p=0.024), and low scores on the GAF (p=0.027). No significant correlations were found between suicidal ideation and anxiety or quality of sleep.; Conclusion: Significant risk factors for suicidal ideation in patients with CRPS include severity of pain, depressive symptoms, and decreased functioning. These results suggest that psychiatric evaluation and intervention should be included in the treatment of CRPS.; Anxiety, Complex regional pain syndrome, Depression, Suicidal ideation","Lee, Do-Hyeong; Noh, Eun Chung; Kim, Yong Chul; Hwang, Jae Yeon; Kim, Sung Nyun; Jang, Joon Hwan; Byun, Min Soo & Kang, Do-Hyung",1,781
782,"Association of school, family, and mental health characteristics with suicidal ideation among Korean adolescents","In a crossâ€sectional research design, we investigated factors related to suicidal ideation in adolescents using data from the 2013 Online Survey of Youth Health Behavior in Korea. This selfâ€report questionnaire was administered to 72,435 adolescents aged 13-18 years in middle and high school. School characteristics, family characteristics, and mental health variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Ï‡Â² tests, and logistic regression. Both suicidal ideation and behavior were more common in girls. Suicidal ideation was most common in 11th grade for boys and 8th grade for girls. Across the sample, in logistic regression, suicidal ideation was predicted by low socioeconomic status, high stress, inadequate sleep, substance use, alcohol use, and smoking. Living apart from family predicted suicidal ideation in boys but not in girls. Genderâ€ and schoolâ€gradeâ€specific intervention programs may be useful for reducing suicidal ideation in students.

783,Behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with suicidal ideation among adolescents,"Suicidal ideation poses a serious threat to the well-being of adolescents and is the strongest risk factor for suicide. Indeed, Korea ranks first among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries regarding the age-standardized suicide rates. In the present study, we examined multiple levels of factors associated with the suicidal ideation of adolescents in Korea by applying the Ecological Models of Health Behavior. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of 860 adolescents. The instruments included the Beck Depression Inventory and the Adolescent Mental Health and Problem Behavior Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression. Sixteen percent of participants reported suicidal ideation. Intrapersonal (sleep disturbance, Internet game addiction, destructive behavior, and depressive symptoms) and interpersonal factors (family conflicts and peer victimization) were associated with suicidal ideation. Because multiple factors were associated with suicidal ideation among adolescents, both intrapersonal (sleep disturbance, Internet game addiction, and depression) and interpersonal factors (family conflicts and peer problems) should be considered in the development of suicide-prevention programs. These programs could include campaigns changing the norms (permissive attitudes toward school violence) and the development of strict and rigorous school non-violence policies.; Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Psychology*, Suicidal Ideation*, Adolescent Behavior/*psychology, Adolescent, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Psychometrics/instrumentation, Psychometrics/methods, Republic of Korea, Risk Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Korea, adolescent, depression, ecological model, suicidal ideation","Lee, GyuYoung & Ham, Ok Kyung",0,783
784,Contact of mental and nonmental health care providers prior to suicide in Taiwan: A population-based study,"Objective: Higher rates of health care service use prior to suicide were previously reported in Western countries; however, these studies have tended to suffer from small sample sizes. This nationwide, population-based study examines the distribution and patterns of health care service use among suicide victims in Taiwan. Method: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked population-based data to determine the proportion of health care service use among suicide victims aged 15 years and older within the 1-year and 1-month period prior to their deaths. After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and health care indices, the differences in health care service use patterns were assessed for age and sex. Results: Among the 19 426 suicide victims in the sample, 83.1% had used nonmental health care services within the 1-year period prior to their death, while only 22.2% had used mental health care services. Men, and suicide victims aged 55 years and older, were less likely to have had any contact with mental health care professionals prior to their deaths (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In line with prior studies, similarly high rates and distinct patterns of health care service use were found in Taiwan prior to suicide. These findings will be of practical interest and should support designing appropriate methods of suicide intervention and effective preventive strategies.

785,Prevalence of suicidal ideation and associated risk factors in the general population,"Background/purpose: Suicide is an important public health problem and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The present study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) and its associated risk factors in the general population.; Methods: A nationwide community survey was conducted using a computer-aided telephone interview system with residents aged >or= 15 years, who were selected by a stratified, proportional randomization method. The questionnaire comprised demographic variables, five items of psychopathology selected from the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) and questions about personal experience with suicide. In total, 2054 respondents, 1002 male (48.8%), and 1052 female (51.2%), completed the survey.; Results: The weighted prevalence of SI was 2.84% in the past week, 5.50% in the past year, and 18.49% during a lifetime. Significant risk factors for SI in the last week included presence of SI over the past year [odds ratio (OR) =1763.6], SI during the lifetime (OR =267.6), psychiatric morbidity (OR = 30.3), depression (OR =26.1), inferiority (OR =11.2), hostility (OR = 10.9), anxiety (OR = 10.5), insomnia (OR =6.7), history of seeking help for psychological distress (OR = 7.9), divorce (OR =6.4), unemployment (OR = 5.0) and having suicidal behavior in relatives or friends (OR =3.8). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the five symptom items of BSRS-5 and unemployment significantly predicted 25.3% of the variance of SI. Using the BSRS-5 score 3 or 4 as a cut-off to predict SI, the rate of accurate classification was 85.88%, with sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.86.; Conclusion: A telephone interview survey containing the BSRS-5 items is an efficient way to identify determinants of SI in the general population.; (c) 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

786,Development of a suicide index model in general adolescents using the South Korea 2012-2016 national representative survey data,"Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and a major public health concern. Here we developed a risk stratification model for adolescent suicide attempts using sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviours and psychological variables. Participants were 247,222 subjects in the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS). We developed a suicide index based on the suicide risk estimated in the generalized linear model and proposed the risk stratification model using the R language to measure the probability of suicide attempt among adolescents. Among the study population, the annual rate of suicide attempt was approximately 4%. The model provided good prediction for suicide attempt (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.85). The important univariate risk factors for the outcome were dimensional measures of age, sex, breakfast consumption, experience of violence, sleep duration, perceived stress, feeling of sadness, current cigarette smoking, current alcohol drinking, perceived general health, perceived academic record, household economic status and living with biological or adoptive parents. Our suicide index model allowed the identification of adolescents who are at a high risk for suicide. This tool may promote the prevention of adolescent suicide and can be particularly useful in everyday settings where it is difficult to contact mental health professionals immediately.; ","Lee, Jinhee; Jang, Ho; Kim, Jongkoo & Min, Seongho",0,786
787,"Sleep duration's association with diet, physical activity, mental status, and weight among Korean high school students","Background and Objectives: Sleep deprivation is a critical public health problem, especially in Korean adolescents. This study aimed to identify the association between sleep duration and dietary behaviors, physical activity, mental status, and nutritional status among high school students in South Korea.; Methods and Study Design: Based on the data collected from the 2014 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, 31,407 high school students who met the inclusion criteria were selected and the association between sleep duration and selected health risk factors was identified using multivariable logistic regression models.; Results: The average daily sleep duration was 5.7 hours, and the mean BMI was 21.3 kg/m2. Participants with shorter durations of sleep (<7 hours versus >=7 hours of sleep) were more likely to feel sad or hopeless (adjusted OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.18), have suicidal ideation (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27), and feel much or very much stressed (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.66-2.00). Moreover, shorter sleep was associated with less frequent muscle-strengthening exercises, >=3 times per week (adjusted OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94), and more frequent cracker consumption, >=3 times per week (adjusted OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.35).; Conclusions: High school students in South Korea suffer from extreme sleep deprivation; only 16% of the students were found to have >=7 hours of sleep during weekdays. Sleep education should be provided to students to improve their physical and mental health.; ","Lee, Jounghee",0,787
788,Anxiety symptoms and occupational stress among young Korean female manufacturing workers,"Background: The prevalence of anxiety disorders has been increasing in South Korea, with recent studies reporting anxiety disorders as the most common mental disorder among all South Korean females. Anxiety disorders, which are independent risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, are significantly correlated with productivity loss, high medical costs, impaired work performance, and frequent worker absence, and thus are potentially serious problems affecting the health of South Korean female workers. In previous studies, anxiety disorders were shown to have a significant correlation with occupational stress. This study seeks to examine the prevalence of anxiety symptoms as well as the relationship between occupational stress and anxiety symptoms among South Korean female manufacturing workers.; Methods: A structured self-reported questionnaire was administered to 1,141 female workers at an electrical appliance manufacturing plant. The questionnaire collected data on general characteristics, health behaviors, sleep quality, job characteristics (shift work, shift work schedule, and job tenure), occupational stress, and anxiety symptoms. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, occupational stress with the Korean Occupational Stress Scale-Short Form (KOSS-SF), and anxiety symptoms with the Korean version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory. A chi square test was conducted to determine the distribution differences in anxiety symptoms based on general characteristics, health behaviors, job characteristics, and sleep quality. A linear-by-linear association test was used to determine the distribution differences between anxietysymptoms and the levels of occupational stress. Last, logistic regression analysis was used in order to determine the association between occupational stress and anxiety symptoms.; Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 15.2 %. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis that adjusted for sleep quality and general characteristics, a significantassociation was found for those with anxiety disorders; the odds ratios (OR) were significantly higher the greater the total KOSS-SF score (moderate-risk group OR=2.85, 95 % CI=1.79-4.56; high-risk group OR=5.34, 95 % CI=3.59-7.96). In addition, excluding insufficient job control, all other KOSS-SF subscales were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms, and a relatively high OR was seen in the high-risk group for job demand (OR=3.19, 95 % CI=2.27-4.49), job insecurity (OR=4.52, 95 % CI=2.86-7.13), and occupational culture (OR=4.52, 95 % CI=2.90-7.04).; Conclusion: There was a significant association between anxiety symptoms and occupational stress stemming from the psychosocial work environment among these South Korean female manufacturing workers. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association between the occupational stress caused by the psychosocial work environment and the incidence of anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, intervention programs that aim to address the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and improve the psychosocial work environment, especially for younger female manufacturing workers, are needed.; ","Lee, Kang Ho; Ho Chae, Chang; Ouk Kim, Young; Seok Son, Jun; Kim, Ja-Hyun; Woo Kim, Chan; Ouk Park, Hyoung; Ho Lee, Jun & Saeng Jung, Young",1,788
789,Nightmare distress as a mediator between nightmare frequency and suicidal ideation,"Previous studies investigating the relationship between nightmares and suicidal ideation have been equivocal. In this study, we investigated the role of nightmare distress in the relationship between nightmare frequency and suicidal ideation. Study participants were 280 undergraduate students (Mage = 21.84, Â±2.14 SD, 77.9% women), who answered 'yes' to experiencing nightmares in the past year. All participants completed questionnaires on nightmare frequency (Nightmare Frequency Questionnaire), nightmare distress (Nightmare Distress Questionnaire), suicidal ideation (Depressive Symptom Inventoryâ€”Suicidality Subscale), and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index). Mediation analyses determined that nightmare distress fully mediated the relationship between nightmare frequency and suicidal ideation after controlling for insomnia. Although the total effect on the relationship between nightmare frequency and suicidal ideation (B = .21, SE = .08, p = .009), the direct effects of nightmare frequency on suicidal ideation were not significant after accounting for the effects of nightmare distress and insomnia (B = .12, SE = .08, p = .16). Additionally, the indirect effect of nightmare distress on the relationship between nightmare frequency and suicidal ideation was significant bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.0306, 0.1946]. Finally, gender moderated the mediated effect of nightmare distress between nightmare frequency and suicidal ideation. Our results support that both nightmare frequency and nightmare distress should be evaluated in clinical and research settings, especially for women, in the context of suicidal risk assessment.

790,The Association between Inappropriate Weight Control Behaviors and Suicide Ideation and Attempt among Korean Adolescents,"Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents globally, and body weight is also a recognized reason for adolescent suicide. Therefore, we investigated the association between weight control behaviors (WCB) and suicide ideation and attempt, focusing on inappropriate weight control measures. We used data from the 2014 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, representing a total of 35,224 boys and 34,361 girls aged 12 to 18 years. Adolescents were classified into groups based on WCB: appropriate WCB, inappropriate WCB, and no WCB. We performed logistic regression models to examine associations between WCB and suicide ideation and attempt, controlling for covariates. Both boys and girls with inappropriate WCB were more likely to report suicide ideation and attempt. Underweight and normal weight boys with inappropriate WCB were more likely to think or attempt suicide, and underweight girls with inappropriate WCB were also more likely to attempt suicide. Among five common WCB combinations, the combination of regular exercise fasting eating less"" was highly associated with suicide ideation and attempt. We confirmed that inappropriate WCB is associated with suicide ideation and attempt among Korean adolescents. Given the high incidence rate of suicide among adolescents and the adverse effect of inappropriate WCB encouraging adolescents to control their weight in healthy ways is imperative.; ""Psychology, Adolescent*, Suicidal Ideation*, Body Weight/*physiology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adolescent, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Female, Humans, Internet, Logistic Models, Male, Odds Ratio, Perception, Republic of Korea, Risk Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Adolescent, Body Weight Changes, Suicide, Weight Perception","Lee, Sang Ah; Jang, Suk Yong; Shin, Jaeyong; Ju, Yeong Jun; Nam, Jin Young & Park, Eun Cheol",0,790
791,Association of atopic dermatitis with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors among adolescents in Korea: the 2013 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease which has been known to negatively influence the mental health of patients. However, only a few studies have explored the prevalence of psychiatric problems among AD patients, particularly among adolescents. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of AD with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors among adolescents by analyzing data from the 2013 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationwide web-based survey.; Methods: Data from 72,435 adolescent middle and high school students in Korea were analyzed. Students self-reported AD diagnosed by a doctor and yes-or-no answers to questions about depressive symptoms and suicide ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts were analyzed. Relationships between AD and depressive symptoms or suicidal behaviors were tested by logistic regression models after controlling for potential confounding factors.; Results: The proportion of adolescents who had AD was 6.8%. The proportion of adolescents reporting depressive feelings was 31.0%, suicide ideation was 16.3%, suicide planning was 5.8%, and suicide attempts was 4.2%. Compared to adolescents without AD, adolescents with AD were significantly more likely to experience depressive feelings (odds ratio [OR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.19-1.36), suicide ideation (OR: 1.34, 95% Cl: 1.24-1.45), suicide planning (OR: 1.46, 95% Cl: 1.32-1.65), and suicide attempts (OR: 1.51, 95% Cl: 1.33-1.72). In the multivariate model, the relationships between AD and suicide ideation (OR: 1.26, 95% Cl:1.16-1.36), suicide planning (OR: 1.28, 95% Cl:1.14-1.44), and suicide attempt (OR: 1.29, 95% Cl:1.13-1.49) were statistically significant.; Conclusion: Adolescents who have AD are associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms and suicidal behaviors.

792,"Influence of parental stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation on adolescents' suicidal ideation : The 2008-2013 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","Background: Maternal depression and suicidal ideation (SI) predict adolescent SI. However, the influence of paternal psychopathology is less clear. This study examines how parental psychopathology contributes to adolescent SI.; Methods: Data from a cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based survey was used. It assessed 4,073 adolescents (12-18 years) and their parents identified through random sampling of the non-institutionalized population in Korea. Stress, depressed mood, and SI of parents and adolescents were assessed using multivariate logistic regression to determine the association of adolescents' SI with parental stress, depressed mood, and SI.; Results: Adolescents who reported SI were more likely to be girls, have shorter sleep duration, more stress, and a depressed mood than were adolescents without SI. Logistic regression analysis showed estimated odds ratios for SI of 1.444 (pâ€¯<â€¯.05), 1.485 (pâ€¯<â€¯.05) and 1.801 (pâ€¯<â€¯.05) for girls who had mothers with stress, depressed mood, and SI, respectively, and 2.113 (pâ€¯<â€¯.05) and 3.091 (pâ€¯<â€¯.05) for girls who had fathers with depressed mood and SI, respectively. Boys' SI was associated with father's depressed mood (OR: 2.608, pâ€¯<â€¯.05).; Limitations: Cross-sectional design and use of self-report measures.; Conclusions: Girls' SI was related to both parents' stress, depressed mood, and SI except for father's stress, and boys' SI was related to father's depressed mood. Evaluations and therapeutic interventions for adolescents with SI should consider both adolescents and their parents, and family-based interventions could be one method for adolescent suicide prevention.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

793,Insufficient sleep and suicidality in adolescents,"Study Objectives: To investigate the association between the behaviorally induced insufficient sleep and suicidality among adolescents. Design: A population-based, cross-sectional survey. Setting: General community. Participants: A sample of 8,530 students (grades 7-11) was recruited in the Republic of Korea. The participants were 8,010 students who completed all questionnaires. Intervention: N/A. Measurements: The survey included the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and questionnaires about sleep (weekday/weekend sleep schedule/duration, insomnia and snoring). Results: Adolescents with behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (BISS) had higher SSI scores than those who slept â‰¥ 7 hours on weekdays, even after controlling for age, sex, and BDI score (F = 11.71, P < 0.001). After controlling for age and sex, longer weekend oversleep and shorter weekday sleep duration predicted a higher SSI score (Î² = 0.19, P < 0.001; Î² = 0.37, P < 0.001). The association between weekend oversleep and SSI score remained significant even after additionally controlling for BDI and ESS scores and presence of insomnia and snoring (Î² = 0.07, P < 0.01). Conclusion: BISS was found to be associated with increased suicidality. Weekend oversleep was associated with suicidality independently of depression, daytime sleepiness, snoring, and insomnia. The study findings suggest that chronic sleep restriction among adolescents may increase suicidal risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

794,Opicapone as adjunct to levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson disease and motor fluctuations: A randomized clinical trial,"Importance: Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are an established treatment for end-of-dose motor fluctuations associated with levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Current COMT inhibitors carry a high risk for toxic effects to hepatic cells or show moderate improvement. Opicapone was designed to be effective without the adverse effects. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 25- and 50-mg/d dosages of opicapone compared with placebo as adjunct to levodopa therapy in patients with PD experiencing end-of-dose motor fluctuations. Design: This phase 3 international, multicenter outpatient study evaluated a 25- and a 50-mg/d dosage of opicapone in a randomized, double-blind, 14- to 15-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial, followed by a 1-year open-label phase during which all patients received active treatment with opicapone. Patients with PD who experienced signs of end-of-dose deterioration and had a mean total awake off-time (state of akinesia or decreased mobility) of at least 1.5 hours, not including morning akinesia, were enrolled. Data were collected from March 18, 2011, through June 25, 2013. Data from the evaluable population were analyzed from July 31, 2013, to July 31, 2014. Main outcomes and measures: The primary efficacy outcome of the double-blind phase was the change from baseline in absolute off-time vs placebo based on patient diaries. The open-label phase focused on maintenance of treatment effect in off-time. Results: A total of 427 patients (258 men [60.4%] and 169 women [39.6%]; mean [SD] age, 63.1 [8.8] years) were randomized to a 25-mg/d (n = 129) or a 50-mg/d (n = 154) dosage of opicapone or to placebo (n = 144). Of these, 376 patients completed the double-blind phase and entered the open-label phase, of whom 286 completed 1 year of open-label treatment. At the end of the double-blind phase, the least squares mean change (SE) in off-time was -64.5 (14.4) minutes for the placebo group, -101.7 (14.9) minutes for the 25-mg/d opicapone group, and -118.8 (13.8) minutes for the 50-mg/d opicapone group. The adjusted treatment difference vs placebo was significant for the 50-mg/d opicapone group (treatment effect, -54.3 [95% CI, -96.2 to -12.4] minutes; P = .008), but not for the 25-mg/d opicapone group (treatment effect, -37.2 [95% CI, -80.8 to 6.4] minutes; P = .11). The off-time reduction was sustained throughout the open-label phase (-126.3 minutes at 1-year open-label end point). The most common adverse events in the opicapone vs placebo groups were dyskinesia, constipation, and dry mouth. Fifty-one patients (11.9%) discontinued from the study during the double-blind phase. Conclusions and relevance: Treatment with a 50-mg once-daily dose of opicapone was associated with a significant reduction in mean daily off-time in levodopa-treated patients with PD and motor fluctuations, and this effect is maintained for at least 1 year. Opicapone was safe and well tolerated.

795,Discovery and validation of blood biomarkers for suicidality,"Suicides are a leading cause of death in psychiatric patients, and in society at large. Developing more quantitative and objective ways (biomarkers) for predicting and tracking suicidal states would have immediate practical applications and positive societal implications. We undertook such an endeavor. First, building on our previous blood biomarker work in mood disorders and psychosis, we decided to identify blood gene expression biomarkers for suicidality, looking at differential expression of genes in the blood of subjects with a major mood disorder (bipolar disorder), a high-risk population prone to suicidality. We compared no suicidal ideation (SI) states and high SI states using a powerful intrasubject design, as well as an intersubject case-case design, to generate a list of differentially expressed genes. Second, we used a comprehensive Convergent Functional Genomics (CFG) approach to identify and prioritize from the list of differentially expressed gene biomarkers of relevance to suicidality. CFG integrates multiple independent lines of evidence-genetic and functional genomic data-as a Bayesian strategy for identifying and prioritizing findings, reducing the false-positives and false-negatives inherent in each individual approach. Third, we examined whether expression levels of the blood biomarkers identified by us in the live bipolar subject cohort are actually altered in the blood in an age-matched cohort of suicide completers collected from the coroner's office, and report that 13 out of the 41 top CFG scoring biomarkers (32%) show step-wise significant change from no SI to high SI states, and then to the suicide completers group. Six out of them (15%) remained significant after strict Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Fourth, we show that the blood levels of SAT1 (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1), the top biomarker identified by us, at the time of testing for this study, differentiated future as well as past hospitalizations with suicidality, in a live cohort of bipolar disorder subjects, and exhibited a similar but weaker pattern in a live cohort of psychosis (schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder) subjects. Three other (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3)) of the six biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction showed similar but weaker effects. Taken together, the prospective and retrospective hospitalization data suggests SAT1, PTEN, MARCKS and MAP3K3 might be not only state biomarkers but trait biomarkers as well. Fifth, we show how a multi-dimensional approach using SAT1 blood expression levels and two simple visual-analog scales for anxiety and mood enhances predictions of future hospitalizations for suicidality in the bipolar cohort (receiver-operating characteristic curve with area under the curve of 0.813). Of note, this simple approach does not directly ask about SI, which some individuals may deny or choose not to share with clinicians. Lastly, we conducted bioinformatic analyses to identify biological pathways, mechanisms and medication targets.

796,Anxiety symptoms in elderly patients with depression: what is the best approach to treatment?,"Depressed elderly persons frequently have concurrent symptoms of anxiety or comorbid anxiety disorders. Such comorbidity is associated with a more severe presentation of depressive illness, including greater suicidality. Additionally, most antidepressant treatment studies in the elderly have found poorer treatment outcomes in those with comorbid anxiety (including delayed or diminished response and increased likelihood of dropout from treatment). While antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic agents are efficacious for late-life depression, there is no evidence that either class is superior, in terms of efficacy or tolerability, in the treatment of anxious depression. Rather, the amount and quality of clinical management, and not the particular medication chosen, appears to influence the likelihood of remission or treatment withdrawal in anxious depressed elderly patients. Co-prescription of benzodiazepines, typically lorazepam, is also warranted in some cases for severe anxiety or insomnia, but carries the risk of cognitive or motor impairment. It is our experience that close clinical monitoring, together with maximization of antidepressant treatment (by maximising dosage, augmenting or switching agents in cases of partial or no response, and/or adding psychotherapy) will almost always result in remission of depressive symptoms, together with improvement of anxiety, in these individuals. Therefore, optimism should be maintained when treating the depressed elderly individual, even when comorbid anxiety is present.;Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Aged, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Geriatric Assessment, Humans, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome, Treatment Refusal","Lenze, Eric J; Mulsant, Benoit H; Shear, M Katherine; Houck, Patricia & Reynolds III, Charles F",0,796
797,"Sleep, depression and suicide","Comments on an article by W. R. Pigeon (see record [rid]2010-19063-004[/rid]). The editorial accompanying the report on insomnia and associated suicide risk calls for further study of suicide and sleep dysfunction. This is appropriate but short-sighted. Almost all suicides are associated with and preceded by depression. The hypothesis for this study should be: medical depression results from altered brain chemistry and function due to the cumulative stress of ongoing inadequate sleep (either insufficient quantity or poor quality or both). The challenge is to correct the root cause of the sleep problem, whether it is simple deprivation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or restless legs syndrome (RLS)/periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), and then observe the effect on depression, ideally unconfounded by anti-depressant drugs. Persons who get adequate sleep feel better and handle the stresses of everyday life better. It seems logical that restoration of an adequate quantity or quality of sleep would improve or even resolve depression and that a reduction in suicides would follow.

798,Smoking-related correlates of depressive symptom dimensions in treatment-seeking smokers,"Introduction: The symptomatic heterogeneity of depression poses a barrier to understanding the smoking-depression relationship. Different types of depressive symptoms have evidenced disparate relations to smoking. Yet, depression measures employed in past depression-smoking research yield symptom subdimensions, which may not be sufficiently comprehensive or distinct. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS; Watson, D., O'Hara, M. W., Chmielewski, M., McDade-Montez, E. A., Koffel, E., Naragon, K., et al. (2008). Further validation of the IDAS: Evidence of convergent, discriminant, criterion, and incremental validity. Psychological Assessment, 20, 248-259. doi:10.1037/a0012570) produce 8 distinguishable depressive symptom dimensions: dysphoria (anhedonia, sadness, psychomotor disturbance, worthlessness, worry, and cognitive difficulty), lassitude (anergia and hypersomnia), suicidality (self-harm thoughts/behaviors), ill temper (anger), well-being (positive thinking), appetite loss, appetite gain, and insomnia. The present study examined common and unique relations of IDAS depression subdimensions to (a) smoking rate (cigarettes perday), (b) tobacco dependence, and (c) smoking motivation.; Methods: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional associations in baseline data collected from 338 daily smokers enrolled in a larger cessation study.; Results: In individual models examining each symptom dimension in isolation, each symptom dimension was significantly with associated smoking rate, tobacco dependence, and/or various aspects of smoking motivation (e.g., subjective addiction, habit, appetite control, affect modulation). In combined models including all 8 dimensions as simultaneous regressor variables, dysphoria was the only dimension to retain most of its significant associations to smoking characteristics.; Conclusions: Relations of depressive symptoms to tobacco dependence, smoking rate, and motivation may be explained by (a) variance specific to dysphoria symptoms and (b) shared variance across depressive symptom subdimensions. Dysphoria symptoms, which contain core DSM-IV depression criteria, may be central to depression-smoking comorbidity, whereas other symptoms may play a less prominent role.;Anxiety/*psychology, Depression/*psychology, Smoking/*psychology, Tobacco Use Disorder/*psychology, Adult, Cross-Sectional Studies, Demography, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motivation, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Smoking Cessation/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires","Leventhal, Adam M; Zvolensky, Michael J & Schmidt, Norman B",0,798
799,Towards understanding and predicting suicidality in women: biomarkers and clinical risk assessment,"Women are under-represented in research on suicidality to date. Although women have a lower rate of suicide completion than men, due in part to the less-violent methods used, they have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Our group has previously identified genomic (blood gene expression biomarkers) and clinical information (apps) predictors for suicidality in men. We now describe pilot studies in women. We used a powerful within-participant discovery approach to identify genes that change in expression between no suicidal ideation (no SI) and high suicidal ideation (high SI) states (n=12 participants out of a cohort of 51 women psychiatric participants followed longitudinally, with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, depression, schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia). We then used a Convergent Functional Genomics (CFG) approach to prioritize the candidate biomarkers identified in the discovery step by using all the prior evidence in the field. Next, we validated for suicidal behavior the top-ranked biomarkers for SI, in a demographically matched cohort of women suicide completers from the coroner's office (n=6), by assessing which markers were stepwise changed from no SI to high SI to suicide completers. We then tested the 50 biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction in the validation step, as well as top increased and decreased biomarkers from the discovery and prioritization steps, in a completely independent test cohort of women psychiatric disorder participants for prediction of SI (n=33) and in a future follow-up cohort of psychiatric disorder participants for prediction of psychiatric hospitalizations due to suicidality (n=24). Additionally, we examined how two clinical instruments in the form of apps, Convergent Functional Information for Suicidality (CFI-S) and Simplified Affective State Scale (SASS), previously tested in men, perform in women. The top CFI-S item distinguishing high SI from no SI states was the chronic stress of social isolation. We then showed how the clinical information apps combined with the 50 validated biomarkers into a broad predictor (UP-Suicide), our apriori primary end point, predicts suicidality in women. UP-Suicide had a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 82% for predicting SI and an AUC of 78% for predicting future hospitalizations for suicidality. Some of the individual components of the UP-Suicide showed even better results. SASS had an AUC of 81% for predicting SI, CFI-S had an AUC of 84% and the combination of the two apps had an AUC of 87%. The top biomarker from our sequential discovery, prioritization and validation steps, BCL2, predicted future hospitalizations due to suicidality with an AUC of 89%, and the panel of 50 validated biomarkers (BioM-50) predicted future hospitalizations due to suicidality with an AUC of 94%. The best overall single blood biomarker for predictions was PIK3C3 with an AUC of 65% for SI and an AUC of 90% for future hospitalizations. Finally, we sought to understand the biology of the biomarkers. BCL2 and GSK3B, the top CFG scoring validated biomarkers, as well as PIK3C3, have anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic effects, are decreased in expression in suicidality and are known targets of the anti-suicidal mood stabilizer drug lithium, which increases their expression and/or activity. Circadian clock genes were overrepresented among the top markers. Notably, PER1, increased in expression in suicidality, had an AUC of 84% for predicting future hospitalizations, and CSNK1A1, decreased in expression, had an AUC of 96% for predicting future hospitalizations. Circadian clock abnormalities are related to mood disorder, and sleep abnormalities have been implicated in suicide. Docosahexaenoic acid signaling was one of the top biological pathways overrepresented in validated biomarkers, which is of interest given the potential therapeutic and prophylactic benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. Some of the top biomarkers from the current work in women showed co-directionality of change in expression with our previous work in men, whereas others had changes in opposite directions, underlying the issue of biological context and differences in suicidality between the two genders. With this study, we begin to shed much needed light in the area of female suicidality, identify useful objective predictors and help understand gender commonalities and differences. During the conduct of the study, one participant committed suicide. In retrospect, when the analyses were completed, her UP-Suicide risk prediction score was at the 100 percentile of all participants tested.; Suicide/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adult, Area Under Curve, Biomarkers/blood, Bipolar Disorder/psychology, Depression/psychology, Female, Forecasting/methods, Gene Expression, Genomics/methods, Humans, Pilot Projects, Psychotic Disorders, ROC Curve, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Schizophrenia, Sex Factors, Suicidal Ideation","Levey, D.

800,Posttraumatic stress disorder and cardiometabolic disease,"The need for addressing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among combat veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq is a growing public health concern. Current PTSD management addresses psychiatric parameters of this condition. However, PTSD is not simply a psychiatric disorder. Traumatic stress increases the risk for inflammation-related somatic diseases and early mortality. The metabolic syndrome reflects the increased health risk associated with combat stress and PTSD. Obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease are prevalent among PTSD patients. However, there has been little appreciation for the need to address these somatic PTSD comorbidities. Medical professionals treating this vulnerable population should screen patients for cardiometabolic risk factors and avail themselves of existing preventive diet, exercise, and pharmacologic modalities that will reduce such risk factors and improve overall long-term health outcomes and quality of life. There is the promise that cardiometabolic preventive therapy complementing psychiatric intervention may, in turn, help improve the posttraumatic stress system dysregulation and favorably impact psychiatric and neurologic function.

801,Psychiatric considerations in the primary medical care of the patient with renal failure,"The adequate primary care of patients with renal failure, from the choice of the modality of treatment down to the everyday answering of questions of patients, relatives, and staff, requires a knowledge of the major psychological stresses of the illness and the psychiatric complications resulting from these stresses and their treatment. Among the major stresses of dialysis are the procedure itself, the overall medical treatment which includes medications and diet, and dependency-independence issues arising from the unique and almost abject dependency of patients on a machine, a procedure, and a group of medical professionals. As a result of these physical and psychological stresses, the disorders seen include delirium, depression, anxiety, suicide, uncooperative behavior, sexual dysfunctions, and psychosis. In their treatment, one should first consider what prophylactic steps should be taken to avoid their occurrence. It is best that a behaviorally trained professional be involved in the initial evaluation of all prospective patients. Ideally this should be a consultation-liaison psychiatrist. Such involvement may help in the selection of a modality of treatment best suited for the psychosocial background of the patient and help identify those most susceptible to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Patients should be told of the possibility of complications such as sexual dysfunctions and, in the case of dialysis patients, that they may at some point in the course of their treatment consider voluntary withdrawal from it. Medications have an important role in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, depression, psychosis, and sexual dysfunctions. Concerning the latter, behavioral techniques of Masters and Johnson have been found to be useful. Talking therapies seem to be of value for only to a limited number of motivated patients.;Primary Health Care*, Kidney Failure, Chronic/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*etiology, Mental Disorders/*therapy, Humans, Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy, Mental Disorders/prevention & control, Renal Replacement Therapy/adverse effects","Levy, N B",0,801

Results showed that patients exhibiting suicidal behavior were more likely to have increased total REM time and increased total REM activity. No significant relationship was found between suicidal behavior and DST nonsuppression. Findings also confirmed a previous finding suggesting a link between REM sleep abnormalities and suicidal behavior in schizophrenia. It is postulated that this observed association may be related to serotonergic dysfunction in schizophrenia.

803,Physical activity to overcome the adversity of widowhood: Benefits beyond physical health,"Widowhood has been increasingly encountered because of increasing longevity of women, often characterized by social stigmatization and poor physical and mental health. However, applied research to overcome its adversity has been quite limited. The goal of this study is to explore the role of physical activity in improving the health of widows.A cohort of 446,582 adults in Taiwan who successively participated in a comprehensive medical screening program starting in 1994, including 232,788 women, was followed up for mortality until 2008. Each individual provided detailed health history, and extensive lab tests results.The number of widows increased with time trend. Every other woman above age 65 was a widow (44%). Widows were less active, more obese, and smoked and drank more, had sleep problems, were more depressed with taking sedatives or psychoactive drugs, leading to more suicides. In the global development of health policies by World Health Organization (WHO), physical activity is one of the main factors to reverse poor health. The poor health of inactive widow was mitigated when becoming fully active in this study. Exercise not only reduced the observed 18% increase in all-cause mortality, but also gained 4 years and as much as 14% mortality advantage over the married but inactive. More importantly, becoming physically active energized their mental status, improved sleep quality and quantity, reduced depressions and the need for psychoactive drugs, and increased socialization circles.Widows, a rapidly growing and socially stigmatized group, suffered from social and financial inequality and tended to develop poorer health. Sustained physical activity could be one of the ways for them to overcome and reverse some of the physical and mental adversities of widowhood, and improve their quality and quantity of life.; Exercise*, Widowhood*/psychology, Widowhood*/statistics & numerical data, Adult, Aged, Female, Health Status, Humans, Life Expectancy, Marital Status/statistics & numerical data, Middle Aged, Mortality, Risk Factors, Taiwan/epidemiology, Young Adult","Li, Chu-Shiu; Lee, June Han; Chang, Ly-Yun; Liu, Chwen-Chi; Chan, Yan-Lan; Wen, Christopher; Chiu, Mu-Lin; Tsai, Min Kuang; Tsai, Shan Pou; Wai, Jackson Pui Man; Tsao, Chwen Keng; Wu, Xifeng & Wen, Chi Pang",1,803
804,Perceived School Climate and Chinese Adolescents' Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts: The Mediating Role of Sleep Quality,"Background: School factors play important roles in adolescent suicide. However, little is known about how school climate is associated with adolescent suicide. This study examined the relationship between perceived school climate and adolescent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and whether these relations were explained by adolescent sleep quality.; Methods: A total of 1529 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 14.74 years; 52% boys) participated in the study. They provided self-report data on control variables, perceived school climate, sleep quality, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts.; Results: After controlling for sex, age, family structure, socioeconomic status, and parent-adolescent attachment, we found that perceived school climate negatively predicted adolescent suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66, p < .001) and suicide attempts (OR = 0.72, p < .001). Moreover, perceived school climate positively predicated adolescent sleep quality (Î² = 0.13, p < .001), which in turn, negatively predicted adolescent suicidal ideation (OR = 0.75, p < .001) and suicide attempts (OR = 0.76, p < .001).; Conclusion: These findings, although cross-sectional, indicate that perceived school climate plays an important role in adolescent suicidality.

805,Major depressive disorder and suicide risk among adult outpatients at several general hospitals in a Chinese Han population,"Background: Somatic complaints are often the presenting symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the outpatient context, because this may go unrecognized. It is well understood that MDD carries an increased risk of suicide. This study aimed to identify the risk factors and association with both MDD and suicidality among Han Chinese outpatients. Methods: A multicenter study was carried out in 5189 outpatient adults (â‰¥ 18 years old) in four general hospitals in Guangzhou, China. The 1392 patients who had the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ-9) score â‰¥ 5, indicating depressive symptoms were offered an interview with a psychiatrist by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); 819 patients consented and completed the MINI interview. MINI module B was used to assess suicidality. Stepwise binary logistic models were used to estimate the relationship between a significant risk factor and suicide or MDD. According to with or without MDD, the secondary analysis was performed using the logistic regression model for the risk of suicidility. Results: The current prevalence of MDD and the one month prevalence of suicidality were 3.7% and 2.3% respectively. The odds ratio of suicidality in women was more than twice that in men (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.45âˆ’4.76). Other risk factors which were significantly associated with suicidality were: living alone, higher education, self-reported depression, getting psychiatric diagnoses (MDD, anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorders). Significant risk factors for MDD were also noticed, such as comorbid anxiety disorders, self-reported anxiety, insomnia, suicidal ideation. Limitation: It's a cross-sectional study in outpatient clinics using self-report questionnaires. Conclusion: This study provides valuable data about the risk factors and association of MDD and suicide risk in adult outpatients in Han Chinese. Those factors allow better the employment of preventative measures.

806,Looking beyond the sleep complaints: A link to suicidality,"Comments on an article by W. R. Pigeon (see record [rid]2013-16199-021[/rid]). Pigeon et al. reported an association between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation and behaviors. On the basis of their analysis of 39 studies consisting of 147,753 subjects recruited from the general population and clinical settings, the authors found that sleep complaints, particularly sleep disturbances in general, insomnia, and nightmares, were individually associated with an increased relative risk for suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and completed suicide. Although depression has often been linked to both sleep disruption and suicide in previous research, it was not found to moderate the effect of sleep disturbances on the suicide outcome in Pigeon and colleagues meta-analysis. The findings of this study may have an important implication in the context of suicide risk management. In sum, empirical evidence suggests a necessity to be vigilant for not only insomnia complaints, but also concurrent nightmare disturbances in individuals with psychiatric disorders, especially depression. Interventional studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of sleep-focused treatments that target both insomnia and nightmare disturbances in the clinical management of psychopathology and suicide prevention.

Design: A 4-yr prospective observational study in a cohort of psychiatric outpatients with major depressive disorder was conducted with a standardized diagnostic psychiatric interview and a packet of questionnaires, including a sleep questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, NEO personality inventory, and Short Form-12 Health Survey. Settings: A university-affiliated psychiatric outpatient clinic. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Four hundred twenty-one depressed outpatients were recruited at baseline, and 371 patients (mean age 44.6 Â± 10.4 yr, female 81.8%; response rate 88.1%) completed the reassessments, in which 41% were classified as remitted cases. One year prevalence of frequent insomnia at baseline and follow-up in remitted patients was 38.0% and 19.3%, respectively. One year prevalence of frequent nightmares at baseline and follow-up was 24.0% and 9.3%, respectively. Remitted patients with residual insomnia were more likely to be divorced (P < 0.05) and scored higher on the anxiety subscale (P < 0.05). Remitted patients with residual nightmares were younger (P < 0.05) and scored higher on neuroticism (P < 0.05) and anxiety subscales (P < 0.01). Residual insomnia and nightmares were associated with various aspects of impaired quality of life. Residual nightmares was associated with suicidal ideation (odds ratio = 8.40; 95% confidence interval 1.79-39.33). Conclusions: Residual sleep disturbances, including insomnia and nightmares, were commonly reported in remitted depressed patients with impaired quality of life and suicidal ideation. A constellation of psychosocial and personality factors, baseline sleep disturbances, and comorbid anxiety symptoms may account for the residual sleep disturbances. Routine assessment and management of sleep symptoms are indicated in the integrated management of depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

808,"Nocturnal sleep disturbances as a predictor of suicide attempts among psychiatric outpatients: A clinical, epidemiologic, prospective study","Objective: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including insomnia and recurrent nightmares, represent common distressing sleep complaints that might have important prognostic and therapeutic implications in psychiatric patients. The present study aimed at investigating nocturnal sleep disturbances in relation to the risk of suicide attempts in a consecutive cohort of psychiatric outpatients. Method: Participants attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong were recruited into the study with a detailed sleep questionnaire assessment. The questionnaire was distributed between May and June 2006. Relevant clinical information, with a comprehensive clinical history of patients since their attendance at psychiatric services and 1 year after completion of their questionnaires, was reviewed. Results: The final study population consisted of 1,231 psychiatric outpatients with a mean age of 42.5 years (SD = 11.3; range, 18-65). Both frequent insomnia and recurrent nightmares were significantly and independently associated with an increased incidence of suicide attempts 1 year after questionnaire assessment (insomnia: OR = 6.96; 95% CI, 1.21-39.97; recurrent nightmares: OR = 8.17; 95% CI, 1.06-63.13) and an increase in lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (insomnia: OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.25; recurrent nightmares: OR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51-3.91). Comorbid insomnia and nightmares had increased odds of lifetime prevalence (OR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.53-3.85) and 1-year incidence of suicidal risk (OR= 17.08; 95% CI, 2.64-110.40). Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR= 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.25), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (OR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.15-3.83), heterocyclics (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.21-6.42), and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (OR= 1.54; 95% CI, 1.02-2.33) were independently associated with recurrent nightmares after adjustment for confounding variables. Conclusions: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, particularly frequent insomnia and recurrent nightmares, were independently associated with enhanced suicidal risk among psychiatric patients. Future studies are warranted to investigate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism and interventional responses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Methods: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline in Mayâ€“June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case notes from June 2007â€“October 2014. Results: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%, respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40â€“15.36, P < 0.05). Nightmare complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.68â€“73.43, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.

Method: Symptoms at lifetime worst depressive episode were assessed at structured psychiatric interview in 6008 women of Han Chinese descent, ageâ‰¥30 years with recurrent DSM-IV MD. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatoryfactor analysis (CFA) were performed in Mplus in random split-half samples. Results: The preliminary EFA results were consistently supported by the findings from CFA. Analyses of the nine DSM-IV MD symptomatic A criteria revealed two factors loading on: (i) general depressive symptoms; and (ii) guilt/suicidal ideation. Examining 14 disaggregated DSM-IV criteria revealed three factors reflecting: (i) weight/appetite disturbance; (ii) general depressive symptoms; and (iii) sleep disturbance. Using all symptoms (n=27), we identified five factors that reflected: (i) weight/appetite symptoms; (ii) general retarded depressive symptoms; (iii) atypical vegetative symptoms; (iv) suicidality/hopelessness; and (v) symptoms of agitation and anxiety. Conclusions: MD is a clinically complex syndrome with several underlying correlated symptom dimensions. In addition to a general depressive symptom factor, a complete picture must include factors reflecting typical/atypical vegetative symptoms, cognitive symptoms (hopelessness/suicidal ideation), and an agitated symptom factor characterized by anxiety, guilt, helplessness and irritability. Prior cross-cultural studies, factor analyses of MD in Western populations and empirical findings in this sample showing risk factor profiles similar to those seen in Western populations suggest that our results are likely to be broadly representative of the human depressive syndrome.

812,Prevalence and characteristics of suicidal ideation among 2199 elderly inpatients with surgical or medical conditions in Taiwan,"Background: Worldwide, the elderly are at a greater risk of suicide than other age groups. There is a paucity of research exploring risk factors for suicide in hospitalized elderly patients. Therefore, a study designed to explore the prevalence and characteristic of suicidal ideation (SI), such as QOL (quality of life), a wish to die (WTD), and other factors in elderly inpatients with medical or surgical conditions in Taiwan was warranted. Methods: A total of 2199 hospitalized elderly patients over age 65 were enrolled. Demographic data, 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) data were collected. Logistic regression models were used to find the SI-related factors for all participants and to investigate the covariates correlated with WTD in patients with SI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to find the most important items of the BSRS-5 predictive of SI in this population. Results: SI was found in 3.1% (68/2199) of the elderly. The statistically significantly factors associated with SI were: BSRS-5 item 2 (depression) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.56â€“2.98), item 4 (inferiority) (OR = 1.62, 1.23â€“2.13), item 5 (insomnia) (OR = 1.52, 1.13â€“2.05), and physical domain of WHOQOL (OR = 0.84, 0.72â€“0.99). QOL15 (mobility) (OR = 0.64, 0.46â€“0.90) and QOL 16 (satisfaction with sleep) (OR = 0.62, 0.44â€“0.88) were also significantly associated with SI. The status of living alone (OR = 4.44, 1.24â€“15.87), QOL 26 (absence of negative feeling) (OR = 0.38, 0.15â€“0.98), and QOL 27 (being respected/accepted) (OR = 0.43, 0.20â€“0.92) were significantly associated with WTD among inpatients with SI. The ROC curve analysis revealed that depression, inferiority, and insomnia were the most important items in the BSRS-5 significantly associated with SI among the elderly inpatients. Conclusion: To provide physical recovery and maintain mental health for physically ill elderly inpatients, setting up a multi-faceted approach targeting the aforementioned determinants of SI and WTD for reducing the risk of suicide attempt, and exploring other factors correlated with suicidal behaviors, are important topics and directions for clinical practice and further research.

813,Insomnia identity,"Insomnia identity refers to the conviction that one has insomnia, and this sleep complaint can be measured independently of sleep. Conventional wisdom predicts that sleep complaints are synchronous with poor sleep, but crossing the presence or absence of poor sleep with the presence or absence of insomnia identity reveals incongruity with expected patterns. This review of existing research on insomnia identity processes and influence finds that about one-fourth of the population are uncoupled sleepers, meaning there is an uncoupling of sleep and sleep appraisal, and daytime impairment accrues more strongly to those who endorse an insomnia identity. Research supports the conclusion that there is a cost to pathologizing sleep. Individuals claiming an insomnia identity, regardless of sleep status, are at greater risk for a range of sequelae including self-stigma, depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, hypertension, and fatigue. A broad research agenda is proposed with hypotheses about the sources, clinical mechanisms, and clinical management of insomnia identity.

815,A case of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson disease treated with sodium oxybate,"Presents a case report of a man in his late 60s with a 15-year history of Parkinson's disease (PD) and 20-year history of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) presented with worsening dream enactment behavior (DEB). While the patientâ€™s day time motor symptoms improved following deep brain stimulation, episodes of DEB became progressively more violent, resulting in assault on his wife and self-injurious behaviors. Given the mild severity of OSA, risk of interaction with continuous positive airway pressure device during DEB, and patient preference, conservative treatment was initiated. Violent behaviors persisted despite treatment with standard agents, clonazepam and melatonin. The patientâ€™s maximum tolerated dose of clonazepam was 1mg, as higher doses resulted in drowsiness. Given the persistent threat of violent, potentially fatal behaviors, a trial of sodium oxybate was initiated under supervision during polysomnography. Treatment with sodium oxybate resulted in complete cessation of DEB episodes for 2months, representing a reduction from the patientâ€™s previous frequency of nearly every other night. This is the first reported case of a patient with advanced PD and severe refractory RBD treated safely and successfully with sodium oxybate.

816,Cognitive deficits in bipolar disorders: Implications for emotion,"Prominent cognitive deficits have been documented in bipolar disorder, and multiple studies suggest that these deficits can be observed among non-affected first-degree relatives of those with bipolar disorder. Although there is variability in the degree of cognitive deficits, these deficits are robustly relevant for functional outcomes. A separate literature documents clear difficulties in emotionality, emotion regulation, and emotion-relevant impulsivity within bipolar disorder, and demonstrates that these emotion-relevant variables are also central to outcome. Although cognitive and emotion domains are typically studied independently, basic research and emergent findings in bipolar disorder suggest that there are important ties between cognitive deficits and the emotion disturbances observed in bipolar disorder. Understanding these relationships has relevance for fostering more integrative research, for clarifying relevant aspects related to functionality and vulnerability within bipolar disorder, and for the development of novel treatment interventions. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric illness that has been ranked as one of the 20 leading medical causes of disability (WHO, 2011). BD has been shown to be the psychiatric disorder with the highest rates of completed suicide across two major cohort studies (Ilgen et al., 2010; Nordentoft, Mortensen, & Pedersen, 2011). In a cross-national representative sample, one in four persons diagnosed with bipolar I disorder reported a suicide attempt (Merikangas et al., 2011). Rates of relapse remain high despite available treatments (Gitlin, Swendsen, Heller, & Hammen, 1995), and in the year after hospitalization for manic episode, two-thirds of patients do not return to work (Strakowski et al., 1998). Poverty, homelessness, and incarceration are all too common (Copeland et al., 2009). Despite the often poor outcomes, there is also evidence for outstanding accomplishments and creativity among those with milder forms of the disorder and their family members (Coryell et al., 1989; Jamison, 1993; Murray & Johnson, 2010). Some individuals appear to achieve more than the general population, suggesting the importance of understanding the variables that predict differential outcome within bipolar disorder. Within this paper, we focus on two key predictors of outcomes within bipolar disorder: cognition and emotionality. We review evidence that problems in cognition and emotionality are prominent among those diagnosed with the disorder, are not artifacts of symptom state, and relate substantively to poorer outcomes. Although traditionally studied separately, new work points toward the idea that cognition and emotionality are intricately linked within bipolar disorder. Drawing from research within bipolar disorder as well as outside of bipolar disorder, we build a model of how cognition and emotionality might be tied within bipolar disorder. We then provide suggestions for future research. Before considering findings, it is worth noting that there are several forms of the disorder, defined by varying degrees and duration of manic symptoms (APA, 2013; WHO, 1993). Manic episodes are defined by abnormally elevated or irritable mood, accompanied by increased activity and at least three symptoms (four if mood is only irritable) such as decreased need for sleep, increased self-confidence, racing thoughts or flight of ideas, rapid speech, distractibility, goal-directed activity, and engagement in pleasurable activities without regard to potential negative consequences. To meet criteria for mania, these symptoms must persist for at least one week or require hospitalization, and must lead to difficulties with functioning. If functional impairment is not more than mild and duration is between 4 and 6 days, the episode is considered a hypomanic episode. Bipolar I disorder (BD I) is diagnosed on the basis of at least one lifetime manic episode within the DSM-5 and by at least two episodes within the ICD, whereas bipolar II disorder is diagnosed on the basis of at least one hypomanic episode (and no manic episodes) as well as major depressive episodes. Cyclothymic disorder is defined by chronic but milder fluctuations between manic and depressive symptoms. Most research focuses on BD I. In addition to diagnosed samples, research has focused on those at high risk for bipolar disorder, including first-degree relatives of those with BD. This work draws on the evidence for extremely high heritability of BD I, with estimates from community-based twin studies of 0.85 (KieseppÃ¤, Partonen, Haukka, Kaprio, & LÃ¶nnqvist, 2014). Other research has considered high risk for BD by virtue of lifetime subsyndromal symptoms, as measured by scales such as the Hypomanic Personality Scale (Eckblad & Chapman, 1986) or the General Behavior Inventory (Depue, Krauss, Spoont, & Arbisi, 1989). The study of high-risk individuals provides a way to decipher whether deficits are present before the onset of the disorder, of importance given models suggesting that episodes of the disorder may change brain function (Chang, Steiner, & Ketter, 2000; Strakowski, 2012) as well as individuals' perceptions of their emotion regulation. Beyond defining BD, it is worth defining some of the many different neuropsychological tasks that have been widely studied in BD. Perhaps no area has received more attention than executive function. Executive function is related to three core functions: 1) inhibition, the ability to suppress irrelevant information in working memory in order to accomplish an established goal; 2) working memory, the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind; and 3) cognitive flexibility, the ability to shift strategies in response to feedback (Diamond, 2013; Miyake et al., 2000). Attention (defined as the process of selecting information reception from internal or external cues) is implicated in all three of these aspects of executive function. Much of the literature we will discuss focuses on response inhibition, or the ability to suppress a prepotent response, which is considered a subtype of inhibition. Some tests measure multiple facets of executive function; for example the Trails B test likely requires working memory and cognitive flexibility (SÃ¡nchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). Aside from executive function, multiple other facets of cognition have been widely studied in bipolar disorder. Verbal and non-verbal memory are related to the ability to register, store and retrieve verbal or visual information (Lezak, 1995). Verbal fluency is measured as the number of verbal responses a person can generate to a given target, such as a specific semantic category (e.g., animals, furniture) or phonetic category (e.g., words that begin with letter F) (Diamond, 2013). Although cognitive tasks have been designed to evaluate these specific functions, it is important to note that most measures are highly inter-correlated and may assess multiple overlapping functions to some extent (for example, the Trails B test is often described as an executive function"" task although this task likely involves both working memory and cognitive flexibility. Not surprisingly then some authors label the function of certain tests differently and this is particularly evident in meta-analyses of cognition. As we describe findings in this paper we will use the terms proposed by the authors but will also identify key tests used to define a cognitive construct. With this background in mind we turn to a discussion of cognitive deficits then of emotion-related traits. Our hope is that those concise summaries provide evidence for the importance of both domains but also specificity regarding the facets of emotion and cognition that are most impaired in BD. This specificity then guides our consideration of models that integrate cognition and emotion.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.""","Lima, Isabela M.

817,Association of Suicide Risk With Headache Frequency Among Migraine Patients With and Without Aura,"Migraines with aura have been associated with suicide in adolescents and young adults, but the association between suicide and migraine frequency has not been determined. This study investigated suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among patients with varying frequencies of migraines, with and without auras. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed 528 patients aged between 20 and 60 years from a headache outpatient clinic in Taiwan. All patients completed a set of questionnaires, including a demographic questionnaire, the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Suicide risk was evaluated by self-reported lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts. Patients were divided into low-frequency (1-4 days/month), moderate-frequency (5-8 days/month), high-frequency (9-14 days/month), and chronic (≥15 days/month) migraine groups. The association between migraine frequency and suicidality was investigated using multivariable linear regression and logistic regression. Results: The rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were the highest for chronic migraine with aura (ideation: 47.2%; attempts: 13.9%) and lowest in migraine-free controls (2.8%). Migraine frequency was an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation and attempts in patients with aura (both Ptrend < 0.001), but not in patients without auras. Migraine aura and depression were associated with higher risks of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in patients with migraine. Conclusion: High migraine frequency has a correlation with high suicide risk in patients who experience an aura, but not in other patients with migraine","Lin YK; Liang CS; Lee JT; Lee MS; Chu HT; Tsai CL; Lin GY; Ho TH; Yang FC,",0,817
818,Insomnia as an independent predictor of suicide attempts: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study,"Background: Numerous studies have verified that insomnia is associated with suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide. Limited population-based cohort studies have been conducted to examine the association. The present study aimed to analyze whether insomnia increases the risk of suicide attempts and verify the effects of insomnia on suicide risk. Methods: This study is a cohort study using 2000â€“2013 hospitalization data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to track the rate of suicide attempts among insomnia patients aged 15 years or older. In addition, a 1:2 pairing based on sex, age, and date of hospitalization was conducted to identify the reference cohort (patients without insomnia). Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the effects of insomnia on suicide risk. Results: The total number of hospitalized patients aged 15 years or older was 479,967 between 2000 and 2013 (159,989 patients with insomnia and 319,978 patients without insomnia). After adjusting for confounders, suicide risk in insomnia patients was 3.533-fold that of patients without insomnia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 3.533, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.059â€“4.080, P < 0.001). Suicide risk in low-income patients was 1.434-fold (adjusted HR = 1.434, 95% CI = 1.184â€“1.736, P < 0.001) that of non-low-income patients. Suicide risk in patients with drug dependence and with mental disorders was 1.592-fold (adjusted HR = 1.592, 95% CI = 1.220â€“2.077, P < 0.001) and 4.483-fold (adjusted HR = 4.483, 95% CI = 3.934â€“5.109, P < 0.001) that of patients without drug dependence and without mental disorders, respectively. In the female population, suicide risk in insomnia patients was 4.186-fold (adjusted HR = 4.186, 95% CI = 3.429â€“5.111, P < 0.001) that of patients without insomnia. Among patients aged 25â€“44 years, suicide risk in insomnia patients was 5.546-fold (adjusted HR = 5.546, 95% CI = 4.236â€“7.262, P < 0.001) that of patients without insomnia. Furthermore, the suicide risk of insomnia patients with mental disorders was 18.322-fold that of patients without insomnia and mental disorders (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Insomnia, low income, drug dependence, and mental disorders are independent risk factors for suicide attempts. Female patients and those aged 25â€“44 years are at high risk of suicide due to insomnia. Insomnia, mental disorders, and low income exhibit a synergistic effect on suicide attempts. Clinicians should pay attention to mental status and income level of insomnia patients.

819,Can a 10-Minute Questionnaire Identify Significant Psychological Issues in Patients With Temporomandibular Joint Disease?,"Purposes: For patients with disc displacement disorders (DDDs), psychiatric illness increases the risk of worsening postsurgical pain, postoperative delirium, postoperative incomplete recovery, and worse postoperative life quality. This study provides a fast and practical protocol to evaluate psychological conditions of patients with DDDs of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in clinical care.; Materials and Methods: The populations under investigation in this cross-sectional study included patients with DDD who received treatment from October 2012 through June 2016. Variables included age, gender, education level, and TMJ (Axis I) and psychological (Axis II) evaluations. The 13-item protocol of Axis II evaluations contained a 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5), a pain visual analog scale (VAS; 1 item), major life events (3 items), suicidal risk (3 items), and substance use (1 item). Analysis of variance, Ï‡2 test, and multivariate logistic regression were used for analyses.; Results: Of 177 patients, 75.14% were women (mean age, 37.46Â Â±Â 14.06Â yr). Pain VAS scores clearly supported the following ranking of psychosocial discomforts: disc displacement without reduction with limited opening (DDWORWLO)Â >Â disc displacement without reduction without limited openingÂ >Â disc displacement with reduction. Pain VAS and BSRS-5 correlated with 5 variables in Axis I (trismus, acute TMJ pain, chronic awake bruxism, chronic sleep bruxism, and deep bite). The DDD study indicated that 9.6% of patients required urgent referrals to mental health resources (MHRs) for their moderate and high suicidal risk DDD and 77% required nonurgent referrals to MHRs for their psychiatric morbidity.; Conclusions: This study found that patients with DDD showed a prevalence of suicidal ideation and mean BSRS scores that were higher for anxiety, hostility, depression, interpersonal hypersensitivity, and insomnia than in the general population. Patients with trismus or acute TMJ pain could have a higher pain VAS score; chronic awake bruxism could involve greater hostility and lower depression; chronic sleep bruxism could increase sensitivity to interpersonal interactions; and deep bite could involve a higher anxiety level. DDWORWLO produced the highest pain VAS score in patients with DDD.

820,The symptom cluster-based approach to individualize patient-centered treatment for major depression,"Unipolar major depressive disorder is a common, disabling, and costly disease that is the leading cause of ill health, early death, and suicide in the United States. Primary care doctors, in particular family physicians, are the first responders in this silent epidemic. Although more than a dozen different antidepressants in 7 distinct classes are widely used to treat depression in primary care, there is no evidence that one drug is superior to another. Comparative effectiveness studies have produced mixed results, and no specialty organization has published recommendations on how to choose antidepressants in a rational, evidence-based manner. In this article we present the theory and evidence for an individualized, patient-centered treatment model for major depression designed around a targeted symptom cluster-based approach to antidepressant selection. When using this model for healthy adults with major depressive disorder, the choice of antidepressants should be guided by the presence of 1 of 4 common symptom clusters: anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, and pain. This model was built to foster future research, provide a logical framework for teaching residents how to select antidepressants, and equip primary care doctors with a structured treatment strategy to deliver optimal patient-centered care in the management of a debilitating disease: major depressive disorder.;Patient-Centered Care*, Primary Health Care*, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Anxiety/complications, Depressive Disorder, Major/complications, Fatigue/complications, Humans, Pain/complications, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/complications, Behavioral Sciences, Depression, Evidence-based Medicine, Medical Decision Making, Pharmacotherapy","Lin, Steven Y & Stevens, Michael B",0,820
821,Risk factors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in patients with cancer,"Aims and objectives: To determine the level of postâ€traumatic stress symptoms and to identify demographics, disease history and clinical symptoms that were associated with postâ€traumatic stress symptoms among patients with gynaecological, breast or colorectal cancer in Taiwan. Background: Literature indicated that 7Â·3â€“35Â·2% of patients with cancer had experienced level of postâ€traumatic stress symptoms. However, the postâ€traumatic stress symptoms among patients with cancer in Taiwan was not documented. Design: A crossâ€sectional study. Methods: A total of 347 participants recruited from two general hospitals in southern Taiwan. They completed the Chinese version of Davidson Trauma Scale and a profile describing their demographics and clinical symptoms. Disease history was collected from medical records. Results: Approximately 21Â·6% of participants reported higher score on Chinese version of Davidson Trauma Scale (Mean Â± SD = 22Â·85 Â± 24Â·12). The top four scores on Chinese version of Davidson Trauma Scale were painful memories, insomnia, shortened lifespan and flashbacks. The risk factors of postâ€traumatic stress symptoms were suicidal intention (OR = 2Â·29, 95% CI = 1Â·86â€“2Â·82), chemotherapy (OR = 2Â·13, 1Â·18â€“3Â·84), metastasis (OR = 2Â·07, 1Â·29â€“3Â·34), cancerâ€specific symptoms (OR = 1Â·21, 1Â·15â€“1Â·27) and high education (OR = 1Â·75, 1Â·10â€“2Â·78). Conclusion: To prevent postâ€traumatic stress symptoms, patients with cancer should be routinely screened by psychiatrists for postâ€traumatic stress symptoms, for ongoing symptom control and suicidal intention. Patients with cancer who are at risk of suicidal behaviour should be enrolled in suicide prevention programmes. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses need to assess postâ€traumatic stress symptoms of patients with cancer, particularly those who with high education, suffered from complications of chemotherapy, metastasis and cancerâ€specific symptoms and suicidal intention.

824,Psychological characteristics of Danish women with cosmetic breast implants,"An excess of suicide among women with cosmetic breast implants compared with controls has consistently been reported in epidemiologic studies. We have evaluated psychological characteristics among 423 Danish women with cosmetic breast implants, compared with 414 controls. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for self-reported psychological symptoms were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Substantial excesses of all studied symptoms before implant surgery were reported among women with breast implants compared with women with other cosmetic surgery, whereas ORs for virtually all symptoms occurring after surgery were close to or below 1.0. In particular, ORs for treatment for depression, cognitive/depressive symptoms, and depression/low spirit before surgery were 4.6 (95% CI = 2.1-10.0), 3.9 (95% CI = 1.9-7.8), and 2.5 (95% CI = 1.1-5.5), respectively. In contrast, the corresponding ORs for these 3 psychological symptoms after surgery were 0.9 (95% CI = 0.6-1.4), 1.0 (95% CI = 0.7-1.5), and 1.0 (95% CI = 0.6-1.5), respectively. In conclusion, women with cosmetic breast implants reported preoperative psychological symptoms indicative of depressive disorders substantially more frequently than women with other cosmetic surgery. Future studies using standardized, validated psychiatric assessment tools are needed to determine whether this can explain the higher risk for suicide among a subset of women seeking cosmetic breast implants.;Breast Implants/*psychology, Breast Implants/*statistics & numerical data, Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Denmark/epidemiology, Female, Humans, Patient Satisfaction, Registries, Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology","Lipworth, Loren; KjÃ¸ller, Kim; HÃ¶lmich, Lisbet R; Friis, SÃ¸ren; Olsen, JÃ¸rgen H & McLaughlin, Joseph K",0,824
825,Adverse physiological and psychological effects of screen time on children and adolescents: Literature review and case study,"A growing body of literature is associating excessive and addictive use of digital media with physical, psychological, social and neurological adverse consequences. Research is focusing more on mobile devices use, and studies suggest that duration, content, after-dark-use, media type and the number of devices are key components determining screen time effects. Physical health effects: excessive screen time is associated with poor sleep and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, obesity, low HDL cholesterol, poor stress regulation (high sympathetic arousal and cortisol dysregulation), and Insulin Resistance. Other physical health consequences include impaired vision and reduced bone density. Psychological effects: internalizing and externalizing behavior is related to poor sleep. Depressive symptoms and suicidal are associated to screen time induced poor sleep, digital device night use, and mobile phone dependency. ADHD-related behavior was linked to sleep problems, overall screen time, and violent and fast-paced content which activates dopamine and the reward pathways. Early and prolonged exposure to violent content is also linked to risk for antisocial behavior and decreased prosocial behavior. Psychoneurological effects: addictive screen time use decreases social coping and involves craving behavior which resembles substance dependence behavior. Brain structural changes related to cognitive control and emotional regulation are associated with digital media addictive behavior. A case study of a treatment of an ADHD diagnosed 9-year-old boy suggests screen time induced ADHD-related behavior could be inaccurately diagnosed as ADHD. Screen time reduction is effective in decreasing ADHD-related behavior.; Conclusions: Components crucial for psychophysiological resilience are none-wandering mind (typical of ADHD-related behavior), good social coping and attachment, and good physical health. Excessive digital media use by children and adolescents appears as a major factor which may hamper the formation of sound psychophysiological resilience.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

826,Examining the role of psychological factors in the relationship between sleep problems and suicide,"We sought to conduct the first systematic review of empirical evidence investigating the role of psychological factors in the relationship between sleep problems and suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Twelve studies were identified which examined psychological factors grouped into four categories of cognitive appraisals, psychosocial factors, emotion regulation strategies, and risk behaviours. Although there was substantial heterogeneity across studies with respect to measurement, sampling, and analysis, preliminary evidence indicated that negative cognitive appraisals, perceived social isolation, and unhelpful emotion regulation strategies may contribute to the association between sleep problems and suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Given that findings in this area are currently restricted to studies with cross-sectional designs, the directionality of the interrelationships between these psychological factors, sleep problems and suicidality, remains unclear. We integrate the findings of our review with contemporary psychological models of suicidal behaviour to develop a clear research agenda. Identified pathways should now be tested with longitudinal and experimental designs. In addition, a more thorough investigation of the complexities of sleep, psychological factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours is crucial for the development of targeted psychological interventions.

827,"Nightmares and Suicide in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: The Mediating Role of Defeat, Entrapment, and Hopelessness","Study Objectives: Although nightmares appear to be related to suicidal behaviors, the mechanisms which underpin this relationship are unknown. We sought to address this gap by examining a multiple mediation hypothesis whereby nightmares were predicted to have an indirect effect on suicidal behaviors through perceptions of defeat, entrapment, and hopelessness.; Methods: Data were collected from 91 participants who had experienced trauma and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nightmares were measured by summing the frequency and intensity ratings of relevant items on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Participants also completed questionnaire measures of suicidal behavior, hopelessness, defeat, and entrapment. Given the interrelations between insomnia, PTSD, and suicide, a measure of insomnia was included as a covariate. Furthermore, analyses were conducted with and without those participants who had comorbid depression.; Results: Suicidal behaviors were higher in those participants who experienced nightmares (62%), in comparison to those who did not (20%). Bootstrapped analyses provided support for the hypothesized multistep mediational model. Specifically, nightmares were both directly and indirectly associated with suicidal behaviors, through perceptions of defeat, entrapment, and hopelessness, independent of comorbid insomnia and depression.; Conclusions: For the first time we show that the relationship between nightmares and suicidal behaviors is partially mediated by a multistep pathway via defeat, entrapment, and hopelessness. Clinically, our work highlights the importance of monitoring and targeting nightmares and perceptions of defeat, entrapment, and hopelessness when working with clients who have experienced trauma.; Commentary: A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page 289.; Â© 2016 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.Dreams*, Emotions*, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Suicidal Ideation, Surveys and Questionnaires, Young Adult, defeat, depression, entrapment, hopelessness, insomnia, nightmares, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation","Littlewood, Donna L.; Gooding, Patricia A.; Panagioti, Maria & Kyle, Simon D.",1,827
828,Understanding the role of sleep in suicide risk: qualitative interview study,"Objective: Sleep problems are associated with increased risk of suicide, independent of depression. This analysis explores narrative accounts of the role of sleep in relation to suicidal thoughts and behaviours.; Design: Qualitative study, based on in-depth semistructured interviews which were analysed with an inductive, latent thematic analysis.; Participants: A maximum variation sample of 18 people with experience of a major depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours.; Setting: Primary care, North West England.; Results: Respondents emphasised the importance of sleep for recovery and management of their mental well-being. Moreover, three inter-related pathways were identified, whereby beliefs about sleep contributed to suicidal thoughts and behaviours. First, being awake during the biological night heightened risk of suicidal behaviours, as this was perceived to be an opportune time for a suicide attempt due to the decreased chances that a friend of family member would intervene during a suicide attempt. Additionally, the reduction in available support at night added to suicide risk. Second, failure to achieve good sleep was perceived to make life harder through contributing to core features of depression, such as negative thinking, attention difficulties and inactivity. Third, sleep acted as an alternative to suicide, by providing an escape from problems, including mental health problems, in waking life. However, this desire to sleep to escape was associated with excessive daytime sleeping, which subsequently may reinforce disturbed sleeping patterns.; Conclusions: Sleep problems should be an important treatment target when working with suicidal clients. More broadly, night-time service provision should be considered when developing suicide prevention initiatives.; Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

829,Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality predict next-day suicidal ideation: an ecological momentary assessment study,"Background: Sleep problems are a modifiable risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Yet, sparse research has examined temporal relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and psychological factors implicated in suicide, such as entrapment. This is the first in-the-moment investigation of relationships between suicidal ideation, objective and subjective sleep parameters, and perceptions of entrapment.; Methods: Fifty-one participants with current suicidal ideation completed week-long ecological momentary assessments. An actigraph watch was worn for the duration of the study, which monitored total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep latency. Daily sleep diaries captured subjective ratings of the same sleep parameters, with the addition of sleep quality. Suicidal ideation and entrapment were measured at six quasi-random time points each day. Multi-level random intercept models and moderation analyses were conducted to examine the links between sleep, entrapment, and suicidal ideation, adjusting for anxiety and depression severity.; Results: Analyses revealed a unidirectional relationship whereby short sleep duration (both objective and subjective measures), and poor sleep quality, predicted the higher severity of next-day suicidal ideation. However, there was no significant association between daytime suicidal ideation and sleep the following night. Sleep quality moderated the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening levels of suicidal ideation.; Conclusions: This is the first study to report night-to-day relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and entrapment. Findings suggest that sleep quality may alter the strength of the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening suicidal ideation. Clinically, results underscore the importance of assessing and treating sleep disturbance when working with those experiencing suicidal ideation.; Actigraphy, ecological momentary assessment, entrapment, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, suicide","Littlewood, Donna L.; Kyle, Simon D.; Carter, Lesley-Anne; Peters, Sarah; Pratt, Daniel & Gooding, Patricia",1,829

Participants were sampled from 8 middle/high schools in 3 counties of Shandong, China. Participants completed a structured behavior and health questionnaire, including suicidality, demographics, depression/anxiety, stressful life events (SLEs), and insomnia in November-December 2015. A series of logistic regression models and mediation analyses were performed to examine the associations between SLEs, insomnia and suicidality.Results: The prevalence rates of overall suicidality, SI, SP and SA in the last year were 13.1%, 12.5%, 3.3%, and 1.5%, respectively. SLEs were significantly associated with overall suicidality, SI, and SP. Insomnia was an independent risk factor of suicidality and a mediator of the association between SLEs and suicidality. The total effect of SLEs on overall suicidality was 0.597 (95%CI: 0.534-0.661), including 0.457 (95%CI: 0.391-0.523) for direct effect and 0.158 (95%CI: 0.138-0.178) for indirect effect. Insomnia also mediated the associations of SLEs with SI, SP and SA, respectively.Limitations: Causal relationship could not be concluded because this study is cross-sectional.Conclusions: Stressful life events and insomnia are directly associated with suicidality in adolescents.

831,"Epidemiology of depression at Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Shanghai, China","Background: Though Chinese Traditional Medicine (TCM) is one of the most important parts of health care system in China, studies on the epidemiology of depression in TCM are scarce and mental health issues in TCM have been neglected for longtime. Methods: This was an interview-based survey. The prevalence of depression and suicidal risk in outpatients at a TCM hospital was identified by a one-stage diagnosing process using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Associated risk factors, role impairment, and service utility were also assessed. Results: A total of 2000 outpatients aged from 18 to 65years completed the survey with a response rate of 87.0%. The estimated prevalence of major depressive disorder was 13.2% for lifetime and 4.9% for current. No significant gender differences were found. Depression was more common in patients who lacked social support, experienced family economic burden and health burden, and underwent negative life events, poor self-rated health, or with moderate/severe sleep problem than in their correspondents; all with statistical significance (OR: 1.83â€“6.82). Patients with depression reported a mean of 82.7days and 99.3days of sick leave due to their physical and mental condition, respectively, which was much longer than those without depression (24.8days and 25.8days, respectively). Only 30.0% of patients with depression sought professional help from psychiatrists/psychologists or used antidepressants. Limitations: The recall bias could not be ruled out in this study and could have led to an underestimation of true prevalence and the unmet need for treatment. Since this study was cross-sectional, the causal relationships between sociodemographic factors and depression cannot be determined. Conclusions: Depression is common at TCM hospitals. The impairments due to depression are striking, and unmet needs for treatment are pervasive. Consequently, mental health services in TCM should not be neglected any longer.

832,Suicide risk in patients with migraine and comorbid fibromyalgia,"Objectives: To identify the frequency, clinical effects, and suicide risk in comorbid fibromyalgia (FM) among patients with migraine. Methods: We surveyed patients with migraine who attended a headache clinic. All patients completed questionnaires containing demographics, headache profiles based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition, FM questionnaires based on the modified 2010 American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria, Migraine Disability Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Suicide risk was evaluated by self-report of lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts. Results: Of the 1,318 recruited patients with migraine (aged 42.6 Â± 12.7 years; female/male 5 4.5), 10.1% (aged 44.3 Â± 12.6 years; female/male = 7.9) had comorbidity of FM. Patients with migraine and comorbid FM had higher headache frequency and headache-related disability, poor sleep quality, and were more depressed/anxious than those with migraine only (p < 0.001). Suicidal ideation and attempts were reported in 27.3% and 6.9%of patients with migraine, respectively, and were higher in patients with comorbid FM than in those without (ideation: 58.3% vs 24%; attempt: 17.6% vs 5.7%; p < 0.001). In addition, comorbidity of FM was associated with a higher suicide risk in 3 different migraine subgroups, i.e., migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine. After controlling for covariates, comorbidity of FM remained as a predictor of suicidal ideation and attempts (odds ratio 2.61 and 1.99, respectively, p < 0.05) in patients with migraine. Conclusions: Comorbidity with FM is associated with a high suicide risk in patients with migraine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

833,Case-control study of suicide attempts in the elderly,"Background: Prior studies have inadequately explored the relationship between late-life suicidal behavior and subclinical/clinical symptoms. This study aimed to assess the risk associated with subclinical symptoms, mild cognitive impairment and clinical factors among late-life suicide attempters. Method: Forty-three elderly patients aged 60 years and older who sought emergency services in a university-affiliated general hospital for attempting suicide and 43 comparison subjects participated in this study between March 2005 and December 2006. The comparison group was recruited by advertising in the community around the hospital. DSM-IV based diagnostic interview and screening instruments including the GDS, MMSE, BSRS-5 and APGAR were applied. Adjusted odds ratios were measured in the final multiple logistic regression model. Results: Suicide attempters were more likely to meet a diagnosis of depressive disorder, after adjustments for BSRS-5 score and drinking habit. The adjusted odds of suicide among people with a BSRS-5 score of more than 5 points was 17.8 times higher than those with the BSRS score less than or equal to 5 points. Conclusions: Our findings support the significant impact on late-life suicidal behavior from the assessment of subclinical symptoms, including anxiety, depression, hostility, sleep condition and interpersonal symptoms. The assessment of subclinical symptoms by the BSRS-5 may help in the future prevention of late-life suicidal behavior in primary care settings.

834,Screen Time on School Days and Risks for Psychiatric Symptoms and Self-Harm in Mainland Chinese Adolescents,"Objective: To investigate associations of television and of video game or non-educational computer use (VG/CU) exposure volumes in a typical school day with psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation/self-injurious behavior (self-harm), in mainland Chinese adolescents.; Methods: Secondary school pupils (N = 13,659; mean age: 15.18 Â± 1.89) from 10 urban areas sampled from different regions of mainland China were recruited. The subjects were divided into the following four screen exposure volume groups for television and VG/CU respectively based on a self-administered questionnaire: 0 h/day, >0 to â‰¤1 h/day, >1 to â‰¤2 h/day, and >2 h/day. Demographic and psychiatric symptoms were recorded for each respondent. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for several types of psychological problems and self-harm were calculated.; Results: More than 2 h per school day television watching was associated with higher risk of depression in both boys (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.02-1.73) and girls (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.19-2.21), of anxiety in boys (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.05-1.95), of general emotional, behavioral, and social problems (GEBSPs; OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.01-2.39), and of oppositional defiant problems (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.09-2.50) in girls, compared with no television exposure. Conversely, television exposure of no more than 1 h per school day was associated with lower self-harm risk in boys (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.67-0.99) compared with no television exposure. High school day VG/CU time (>2 h) compared with no VG/CU were associated with higher risks of anxiety (OR = 1.40, 95%CI: 1.06-1.86) and of attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (ADHPs; OR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.02-2.38) in boys. And any school day VG/CU exposure was associated with higher risks of self-harm and all other psychiatric problems in boys and all psychiatric problems (including anxiety and ADHPs) in girls (ORs, 1.44-3.69), compared to no VG/CU exposure.; Conclusion: For secondary school students, associations of psychiatric problems and self-harm were more strongly associated with exposure to VG/CU than with exposure to television. The findings suggest that VG/CU and television exposure on weekdays should be considered in psychiatric interventions for adolescents.; anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity, conduct problems, depression, oppositional defiant, physical activity, sedentary behavior, suicide","Liu, Mingli; Ming, Qingsen; Yi, Jinyao; Wang, Xiang & Yao, Shuqiao",1,834
835,Sleep and Adolescent Suicidal Behavior,"Study Objectives: Suicide risk begins to increase during adolescence. Adolescents do not get enough sleep and are also at risk for many sleep disturbances. This study examined the association between sleep patterns and sleep problems and adolescent suicidal behavior. Design and Setting: A questionnaire survey of adolescents attending school was conducted in one prefecture of Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. Participants: A total of 1,362 adolescents attending school (mean age 14.6 years, 60% males) participated in the survey. Measurements: Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked about sleep patterns, sleep problems, suicidal behavior, depressive symptoms, and demographic characteristics of the family and adolescent. Results: Overall, 19.3% of the sample reported having suicidal ideation, 10.5% having suicide attempts in the past 6 months, 16.9% having insomnia symptoms, 2.3% having taken hypnotic medication, and 48.9% having experience of nightmares in the past month. Mean night sleep duration was 7.6 hours (SD = 0.8). Logistic regression analyses showed that sleeping less than 8 hours at night (OR = 2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-7.81) and frequent nightmares (OR = 2.43,95% CI = 1.76-3.35) were significantly associated with increased risk for suicide attempts after adjustment for age, sex, father's occupation, and depressive symptoms and that nightmares (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.20-2.38) were also significantly related to suicidal ideation. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the association between short sleep duration and nightmares and suicidal behavior and highlight the potential role of sleep intervention in the prevention of adolescent suicide.

836,Sleep and youth suicidal behavior: A neglected field,"Purpose of review: Sleep undergoes substantial changes during adolescence and suicide risk begins to increase during this period as well. This review focuses on recent literature on the relationship between sleep and suicidal behavior and proposes directions for future research. Recent findings: Adolescent sleep is characterized by widespread sleep restriction, irregular sleep schedules, daytime sleepiness, and elevated risk for sleep disturbances. More research on adolescent sleep and psychosocial impairment, psychiatric disorders, and suicidal behavior has been conducted. Suicidal psychiatric patients had more sleep disturbances including insomnia, hypersomnia, or nightmares than nonsuicidal patients. Shorter rapid eye movement latency and increased rapid eye movement activity have been noted to be a marker of suicidality in psychiatric patients. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that insomnia, nightmares, and sleep insufficiency are associated with elevated risk for suicide. Although the link between insomnia and suicidal behavior appears to be mediated by depression, existing data suggest an independent predictive role of nightmares in future suicidal behavior. Summary: Sleep loss or disturbances are likely to signal an increased risk of future suicidal action in adolescents. Large-scale prospective studies and neurobiological studies are needed for a better understanding of the complex relationship between sleep, psychopathology, and youth suicidal behavior.

837,Poor sleep quality and nightmares are associated with non-suicidal self-injury in adolescents,"Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is prevalent and is associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents. This study examined which sleep variables are associated with NSSI, independently from demographics and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. Participants consisted of 2090 students sampled from three high schools in Shandong, China and had a mean age of 15.49 years. Participants completed a sleep and health questionnaire to report their demographic and family information, sleep duration and sleep problems, impulsiveness, hopelessness, internalizing and externalizing problems, and NSSI. A series of regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between sleep variables and NSSI. Of the sample, 12.6 % reported having ever engaged in NSSI and 8.8 % engaged during the last year. Univariate logistic analyses demonstrated that multiple sleep variables including short sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, poor sleep quality, sleep insufficiency, unrefreshed sleep, sleep dissatisfaction, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, and nightmares were associated with increased risk of NSSI. After adjusting for demographic and mental health variables, NSSI was significantly associated with sleeping <6 h per night, poor sleep quality, sleep dissatisfaction, daytime sleepiness, and frequent nightmares. Stepwise logistic regression model demonstrated that poor sleep quality (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI = 1.37â€“3.47) and frequent nightmares (OR = 2.88, 95 % CI = 1.45â€“5.70) were significantly independently associated with NSSI. In conclusion, while multiple sleep variables are associated with NSSI, poor sleep quality and frequent nightmares are independent risk factors of NSSI. These findings may have important implications for further research of sleep self-harm mechanisms and early detection and prevention of NSSI in adolescents.

Little is known about the association between daytime sleepiness and suicidal behaviors. This study examined the prospective relationship between daytime sleepiness and suicidal behaviors, including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA), in a large sample of adolescents.; Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of 7072 adolescents (mean age = 14.6 years) was conducted in Shandong province, China. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess suicidal behaviors, daytime sleepiness, nighttime sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, hopelessness, impulsivity, anxiety/depression, and family demographics. Participants were first surveyed in November-December 2015 and resurveyed 1 year later. Of the 7072 participants, 77.1% (n = 5451) who did not report suicidal behaviors at baseline were included for primary analysis.; Results: The incidence rates of ST, SP, and SA at 1 year follow-up were 6.0%, 2.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. The incidence rates of ST and SP significantly increased with elevated daytime sleepiness score at baseline. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates including sleep-related variables (i.e. insomnia, nighttime sleep duration, and snoring), a daytime sleepiness score â‰¥ median at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk of ST (OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.02-2.35) and SP (OR = 2.60, 95%CI = 1.22-5.53).; Conclusions: Daytime sleepiness appears to be a significant predictor of subsequent suicidal behaviors in adolescents.

A family survey of sleep and health was conducted among 1090 adolescents and their parents in Jinan, China. Adolescents completed a sleep and health questionnaire to report their sleep and mental health problems. Parents reported their insomnia symptoms and history of mental disorders. Insomnia, behavioral problems, and suicidal behavior were compared between IP adolescents and NIP adolescents. IP adolescents were more likely than NIP adolescents to report insomnia symptoms, use of sleep medication, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt. IP adolescents scored significantly higher than NIP adolescents on withdrawn and externalizing behavioral problems. After adjustment for demographics and behavioral problems, parental insomnia remained to be significantly associated with adolescent suicidal ideation and suicide plan. Our findings support the need for early screening and formal assessment of sleep and mental health in adolescents of insomniac parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

840,"Relationships between anhedonia, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a large sample of physicians","Background: The relationships between anhedonia and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts were explored in a large sample of physicians using the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide. We tested two hypotheses: firstly, that there is a significant relationship between anhedonia and suicidality and, secondly, that anhedonia could mediate the relationships between suicidal ideation or suicide attempts and thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness.; Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 557 physicians filled out several questionnaires measuring suicide risk, depression, using the abridged version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), and demographic and job-related information. Ratings of anhedonia, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were then extracted from the BDI-13 and the other questionnaires.; Results: Significant relationships were found between anhedonia and suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, even when significant variables or covariates were taken into account and, in particular, depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses showed significant partial or complete mediations, where anhedonia mediated the relationships between suicidal ideation (lifetime or recent) and perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness. For suicide attempts, complete mediation was found only between anhedonia and thwarted belongingness. When the different components of anhedonia were taken into account, dissatisfaction-not the loss of interest or work inhibition-had significant relationships with suicidal ideation, whereas work inhibition had significant relationships with suicide attempts.; Conclusions: Anhedonia and its component of dissatisfaction could be a risk factor for suicidal ideation and could mediate the relationship between suicidal ideation and perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness in physicians. Dissatisfaction, in particular in the workplace, may be explored as a strong predictor of suicidal ideation in physicians.; Anhedonia*, Suicidal Ideation*, Physicians/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Surveys and Questionnaires","Loas, GwenolÃ©; Lefebvre, Guillaume; Rotsaert, Marianne & Englert, Yvon",0,840

842,"Suicidal ideation among young Afghanistan/Iraq War Veterans and civilians: Individual, social, and environmental risk factors and perception of unmet mental healthcare needs, United States, 2013","Suicidal Ideation among Afghanistan/Iraq War Veterans remains a health concern. As young Veterans adjust to civilian life, new risk factors might emerge and manifest differently in this group versus those in the general population. We explored these differences. With 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we examined differences in risk of past-year suicidal ideation between Veterans of the Afghanistan/Iraq War periods aged 18-34 years (N=328) and age-comparable civilians (N=23,222). We compared groups based on individual and socio-environmental risk factors as well as perceptions of unmet mental healthcare needs. We report adjusted rate ratios (aRRs); interaction terms tested for between-group differences. PY suicidal ideation rates for Veterans and civilians did not differ (52 versus 59 per 1,000, p=0.60) and both groups shared many risk factors. However, drug problems and perceived unmet mental health care needs were vastly stronger risk factors among Veterans versus civilians (interaction terms indicated that the aRRs were 3.8-8.0 times higher for Veterans versus civilians). Other differences were discovered as well. Past-year suicidal ideation rates did not differ by Veteran status among young adults. However, different risk factors per group were detected, which can inform Veteran suicide prevention efforts.; Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Suicidal Ideation*, Health Services Needs and Demand/*statistics & numerical data, Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology, Veterans/*statistics & numerical data, Violence/*statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Adult, Afghan Campaign 2001-, Female, Humans, Iraq War, 2003-2011, Male, Risk Factors, United States/epidemiology, Young Adult, Health care needs*, Socio-ecological model*, Suicide*, Surveillance*, Veterans*","Logan, Joseph; Bohnert, Amy; Spies, Erica & Jannausch, Mary",1,842
843,The TRH-induced TSH response in psychiatric patients: a possible neuroendocrine marker,"The finding of a diminished TSH response to exogenously administered TRH in a significant proportion of depressed patients has now been established as one of the most reproducible findings in biological psychiatry. More than 50 reports, in which more than 1000 patients have been studied, reveal that the TSH response is blunted in approximately 25% of patients with major depression. TSH blunting is clearly not specific for depression, because it also has been observed in mania, alcoholism, and borderline personality disorder. It is doubtful that TSH blunting represents a non-specific response to mental stress: it was found only rarely in schizophrenic patients, and the TSH response to in vivo flooding therapy in phobic patients was normal. In both depression and alcoholism, TSH blunting has been reported to be sometimes a state marker and sometimes a trait marker, i.e. the fault was found to persist into remission in more than half the patients. In both conditions, TSH blunting was unrelated to the patients' age, body weight, height, body surface, thyroid status, and serum cortisol concentrations. It also is unlikely that TSH blunting was due to increased dopaminergic inhibition of thyrotroph cells: serum prolactin concentrations in TSH blunters were found to be normal, and pretreatment with haloperidol had no effect on either basal TSH levels or TSH blunting. In depression, TSH blunting was not associated with previous drug intake, dexamethasone suppression test abnormalities, or variables of biogenic amine metabolism, nor did it usefully segregate between primary and secondary depression or between unipolar and bipolar subgroups. Preliminary evidence suggests that TSH blunting in depression may be related to duration of illness, history of violent suicide attempts, and a reduced 24 h TSH secretion. In alcoholism, TSH blunting was unrelated to family or personal history of depression and duration of abstinence. With reference to clinical utility, TSH blunting may aid in assessing the response to antidepressant treatment, predicting outcome to such treatment, assessing the risk for violent suicide attempts, and describing relationships between different psychiatric populations (e.g. depression and alcoholism).;Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone*, Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*physiopathology, Mental Disorders/*physiopathology, Thyroid Gland/*physiopathology, Thyrotropin/*blood, Alcoholism/physiopathology, Anorexia Nervosa/physiopathology, Biogenic Amines/metabolism, Bipolar Disorder/physiopathology, Borderline Personality Disorder/physiopathology, Chronic Disease, Depressive Disorder/physiopathology, Dexamethasone, Dopamine/blood, Humans, Hydrocortisone/blood, Pain/physiopathology, Schizophrenia/physiopathology, Sleep, REM/physiology, Somatostatin/blood, Thyroid Hormones/blood","Loosen, P T",0,843
844,Sleep complaints as risk factor for suicidal behavior in severely depressed children and adolescents,"Objectives: To investigate the association between sleep complaints and suicidal behaviors among severely depressed children and adolescents. Methods: The sample was 214 youths (56.1% males, mean age 12.5 years) with diagnosis of DSM-IV major depressive disorder consecutively recruited from a university-based outpatient clinic specialized in mood disorders. The structured interview for children and adolescents was applied to participants. The Childrenâ€™s Depression Rating Scaleâ€”revised versionâ€”scored the severity of depression, and the Childrenâ€™s Global Assessment Scale assessed the global functioning. Subgroups of patients were compared for psychopathological association by means of logistic regression, in accordance with presence and absence of sleep complaints and suicidality. Results: The frequency of sleep complaints and suicidal behaviors was, respectively, 66.4% and 52.3%, and both symptoms were observed in 37.9% of patients. Initial insomnia was the most frequent manifestation (58%), followed by night awakening (36%), daytime sleepiness (31%), and early awakening (29.9%). Significant association between sleep disturbance and suicidal behavior was found (odds ratio range of 2.3â€“10.8). Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are potential warning manifestations of suicidal behaviors in depressed youth. Possibly, the severity of the active affective episode likely underlies in both sleep complaints and suicidal behaviors among depressed underage patients.

845,Functional impairment in adult sleepwalkers: A case-control study,"Study Objectives: To investigate the restorative quality of sleep and daytime functioning in sleepwalking adult patients in comparison with controls. Design: Prospective case-control study. Setting: Data were collected at the Sleep Disorders Center, HÃ´pital-Gui-de Chauliac, Montpellier, France between June 2007 and January 2011. Participants: There were 140 adult sleepwalkers (100 (median age 30 y, 55% male) in whom primary SW was diagnosed) who underwent 1 night of video polysomnography. All patients participated in a standardized clinical interview and completed a battery of questionnaires to assess clinical characteristics of parasomnia, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and health-related quality of life. Results were compared with those of 100 sex- and age-matched normal controls. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Of the sleepwalkers, 22.3% presented with daily episodes and 43.5% presented with weekly episodes. Median age at sleepwalking onset was 9 y. Familial history of sleepwalking was reported in 56.6% of sleepwalkers and violent sleep related behaviors in 57.9%, including injuries requiring medical care for at least one episode in 17%. Significant associations were found between sleepwalking and daytime sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and altered quality of life. Early-onset sleepwalkers had higher frequency of violent behaviors and injuries. Sleepwalkers with violent behaviors had higher frequency of sleep terrors and triggering factors, with greater alteration in health-related quality of life. Conclusion: Adult sleepwalking is a potentially serious condition that may induce violent behaviors, self-injury or injury to bed partners, sleep disruption, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and psychological distress, all of which affect health-related quality of life.

846,Brain-derived neurorophic factor serum levels and genotype: Association with depression during interferon-Î± treatment,"Depression has been associated with inflammation, and inflammation may both influence and interact with growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Both the functional Val66Met BDNF polymorphism (rs6265) and BDNF levels have been associated with depression. It is thus plausible that decreased BDNF could mediate and/or moderate cytokine-induced depression. We therefore prospectively employed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in 124 initially euthymic patients during treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-Î±), assessing serum BDNF and rs6265. Using mixed-effect repeated measures, lower pretreatment BDNF was associated with higher depression symptoms during IFN-Î± treatment (Fâ‚â‚„â‚„â‚â‚‡â‚‚ = 6.8; P < 0.0001). However, although the Met allele was associated with lower BDNF levels (F1,830 = 5.0; P = 0.03), it was only associated with increased MADRS scores (Fâ‚„â‚ˆâ‚‰ = 20.3; P < 0.001), and not the BDI-II or HADS. An exploratory comparison of individual BDI-II items indicated that the Met allele was associated with suicidal ideation, sadness, and worthlessness, but not neurovegetative symptoms. Conversely, the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) short allele was associated with neurovegetative symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite and fatigue, but not sadness, worthlessness, or suicidal ideation. IFN-Î± therapy further lowered BDNF serum levels (F4,377 = 5.0; P = 0.003), but this decrease occurred regardless of depression development. The findings thus do not support the hypothesis that decreasing BDNF is the primary pathway by which IFN-Î± worsens depression. Nonetheless, the results support the hypothesis that BDNF levels influence resiliency against developing inflammatory cytokine-associated depression, and specifically to a subset of symptoms distinct from those influenced by 5-HTTLPR.

Findings are complicated by the presence of hormonal drugs (dexamethazone and imipramine) used in the study. Data were obtained mainly by the A. T. Beck and M. A. Hamilton depression scales as well as the eeg, emg, and electrooculogram. Findings show sleep decrements in severe depression with an increase in sleep as depression decreased. Evidence for slow-wave (stages 3 and 4) sleep disturbance in severe depression was presented. Both individual and group data are discussed. (37 ref.)

848,BSRS-5 (5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale) scores affect every aspect of quality of life measured by WHOQOL-BREF in healthy workers,"Purpose: This study aims to evaluate and quantify the possible effect of psychological symptoms on healthy workersâ€™ quality of life (QOL). Methods: The workers were recruited from a factory in south Taiwan. We assessed their psychological symptoms with a 5-item brief symptom rating scale (BSRS-5) and measured the QOL using the Taiwanese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between the two tools after control of confounding by other predictors. Results: A total of 1,080 workers, who attended a physical examination, completed questionnaires and informed consent forms. Scores on the BSRS-5 significantly predicted scores in each domain and items of the WHOQOL-BREF. The magnitude of psychological domain score seemed to be affected the most; every 1 point increase in BSRS-5 was associated with a 0.39 raw score (equivalent to 2.44 percentile) decrease in QOL. The sleep facet of WHOQOL appeared to have the highest association, followed by items of negative feelings, energy, and concentration. Conclusions: The BSRS-5 score is predictive for scores of all four domains and 26 items of the Taiwanese version of the WHOQOL-BREF for regular factory workers.

He was hypotensive and hypothermic. Spontaneous respiration was insufficient. Fluid resuscitation did not restore adequate blood pressure levels. Low dose catecholamine infusion resulted in ventricular arrhythmias. The patient was treated with combined hemoperfusion and hemodialysis during an eight hour period. During this time, serum concentrations of trichlorethanol fell.

850,Physical activity and physical fitness as protective factors of adolescent health,"Objective This quantitative correlational design study aimed to examine the variation in adolescent health and lifestyle characteristics across self-reported physical activity (PA) and physical fitness (PF) levels. Methods Data were collected from 422 students (50.2% males) (16.33 SD = 1.66 y/o) attending a high school. An online questionnaire was used to gather data on the following characteristics: self-reported well-being, overall life satisfaction, depression (including self-harm and suicidal ideation), perceived health status, eating disorders, sleepiness, substance use (alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use), body mass index, PA participation and PF levels. Results Of the participants, 42.4% reported at least 5 days of PA a week for 60 min per day. These high active individuals had significantly better well-being, health status, life satisfaction, PF and consumed fewer alcohol beverages. High PA and better PF inversely correlated with depression. Conclusions It seems that high PA and better PF have a positive impact on adolescent perceived health, health-risk behaviors and mental health. Increased levels of PA can play a vital role in the primary care, prevention of health risks and in adolescent health promotion. Accordingly, educational institutions are an excellent setting to promote and provide sport facilities and encourage students to be more physically active.; adolescents, health risk behavior, physical activity, physical fitness","LukÃ¡cs, Andrea; SasvÃ¡ri, PÃ©ter & Kiss-TÃ³th, EmÅ‘ke",1,850
851,Poor sleep as a risk factor for nonsuicidal self-injury in adolescent girls,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between poor sleep and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), and to test the hypothesis that poor sleep is a risk factor for the development of NSSI in young adolescents. Questionnaire data were used from a 2-wave longitudinal study of a community sample of 881 young Swedish adolescents. The results showed that 7 % of the girls reported poor sleep (never or seldom sleeping well), and 20-26 % of the girls reported repeated NSSI (at least 5 instances). Poor sleep was associated prospectively with NSSI among girls, but not among boys. Of girls who responded that they seldom or never slept well at T1, 77 % reported repeated NSSI 1 year later. Poor sleep at T1 was found to predict the incidence of new cases of repeated NSSI in girls at T2, independently of their degree of psychopathology. No similar relationship between poor sleep and NSSI was found in boys. The present results suggest that screening for poor sleep in adolescents may serve to identify a subgroup of girls at risk for developing NSSI. It is concluded that poor sleep in young girls should be taken seriously, even in the absence of other self-reported psychological problems, and that interventions targeted at sleep disturbances may be important for prevention.

Sixty-two percent of the ID population (n = 915) had a behavior problem (self-injurious, stereotyped, or aggressive/destructive behavior) and 18.7% had a behavior problem identified as challenging behavior, resulting in a prevalence of 80.3 per 100,000 in the base population. The most pronounced risk markers for behavior problems were severity of ID, autism, night sleep disturbances, sensory hypersensitivity, communication dysfunction, social deficits, psychiatry involvement, and psychotropic medication. About 50% of people with behavior problems were on psychotropic drugs. Protective markers were Downâ€™s syndrome and, to some extent, cerebral palsy. The results were largely consistent with those reported in previous studies. Findings not previously reported were that prevalence of aggressive/destructive behavior peaked among those â‰¥70 years.

853,The five-item Brief-Symptom Rating Scale as a suicide ideation screening instrument for psychiatric inpatients and community residents,"Background: An efficient screening instrument which can be used in diverse settings to predict suicide in different populations is vital. The aim of this study was to use the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) as a screening instrument for the prediction of suicide ideation in psychiatric, community and general medical settings.; Methods: Five hundred and one psychiatric, 1,040 community and 969 general medical participants were recruited. The community participants completed a structured telephone interview, and the other two groups completed the self-report BSRS-5 questionnaire.; Results: The logistic regression analysis showed that the predictors of suicide ideation for the psychiatric group were depression, hostility and inferiority (p < 0.001, p = 0.016, p = 0.011), for the community group, inferiority, hostility and insomnia (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.003), and for the general medical group, inferiority, hostility, depression and insomnia (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.020, p = 0.008). The structural equation model showed the same symptom domains that predicted suicide ideation for all three groups. The receiver operating characteristic curve using the significant symptom domains from logistic regression showed that for the psychiatric group, the optimal cut-off point was 4/5 for the total of the significant dimensions (positive predictive value [PPV] = 78.01%, negative predictive value [NPV] = 79.05%), for the community group, 7/8 (PPV = 68.75%, NPV = 96.09%), and for the general medical group, 12/13 (PPV = 92.86%, NPV = 88.48%).; Conclusion: The BSRS-5 is an efficient tool for the screening of suicide ideation-prone psychiatric inpatients, general medical patients, and community residents.

854,Prevalence and impact of short sleep duration in redeployed OIF soldiers,"Study Objectives: Short sleep duration (SSD) is common among deployed soldiers. The prevalence of SSD during redeployment, however, is unknown. Design: Cross-sectional study of a brigade combat team (n = 3152 US Army soldiers) surveyed 90-180 days after completing a 6-15 month deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OI F). Survey items targeted sleep habits and comorbid medical conditions. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios of medical comorbidities associated with SSD. Setting: US Army Infantry Post. Subjects: All soldiers from a redeploying brigade combat team participated in a health assessment between 90 and 180 days upon return to Ft. Lewis from Iraq. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: A total of 2738 (86.9%) soldiers answered questions regarding self-perceived sleep and were included in the analysis. Mean sleep duration was 5.8 Â± 1.2 hours. Nineteen hundred fifty-nine (72%) slept â‰¤ 6 h, but only 16% reported a daytime nap or felt their job performance was affected due to lack of sleep. Short sleep was more common among soldiers who reported combat exposure. After controlling for combat exposure, short sleep duration (SSD) was associated with symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic syndrome, and with high-risk health behaviors such as abuse of tobacco and alcohol products, and suicide attempts. Conclusions: SSD is common among redeployed soldiers. Soldiers who experienced combat are at increased risk for persistent SSD and comorbidities associated with SSD. Efforts to reestablish good sleep habits and aggressive evaluation of soldiers with persistent SSD following deployment may aid in the prevention and management of associated medical conditions.

The present study evaluated this and other hypothesized risk factors in 38 African American adolescent suicide attempters (aged 12-17 yrs) and 76 nonsuicidal controls, using the Psychiatric Consultation Checklist (M. Lyon, 1987). Stepwise logistic regression was used to predict group membership. It was found that threat of separation from a parental figure, insomnia, neglect, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and failing grades were the strongest predictors of suicide attempt. 10 predictor variables correctly identified 97% of suicide attempters and 86% of nonattempters. Unexpected findings included high levels of truancy, threatening others, and separation from a parent before the age of 12 yrs among nonattempters.

The present study investigated symptom patterns in hospitalized patients with depressive syndromes in relation to morningness-eveningness (chronotypes). Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II]) and chronotype (German version of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire [D-MEQ]) were assessed after admission and before discharge in inpatients with mainly major depression. Group differences of BDI-II single items and three BDI-II factors (cognitive, affective, somatic) between patients divided at the D-MEQ sample median into 'morning preference' (MP) and 'evening preference' (EP) were calculated. Data from 64 consecutively admitted patients (31MP/33EP) were analyzed. Both groups (MP/EP) were comparable regarding age, sex, diagnosis, length of stay, and subjective sleep quality, BDI-II scores were significantly higher in EP than in MP at admission. At admission and discharge, cognitive symptoms were significantly more pronounced in EP vs. MP; non-significant differences between EP and MP were found for affective and somatic symptoms. The results underline the importance of the trait-like chronotype for severity and symptomatology in patients with depressive disorders. The patientsâ€™ chronotype should be taken into account in diagnostics and treatment of depressive disorders.

This study assessed whether adjunctive maintenance treatment with risperidone long-acting therapy (RLAT), added to treatment-as-usual (TAU) medications for bipolar disorder, delays relapse in patients with bipolar disorder type I. Methods: This study included patients with bipolar disorder type I with â‰¥four mood episodes in the 12 months prior to study entry. Following a 16-week, open-label stabilization phase with RLAT plus TAU, remitted patients entered a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention phase. Randomized patients continued treatment with adjunctive RLAT (25 50 mg every two weeks) plus TAU (n = 65) or switched to adjunctive placebo injection plus TAU (n = 59). The primary outcome measure was time to relapse to any mood episode. Results: Of 240 enrolled patients, 124 entered double-blind treatment. Time to relapse was longer in patients receiving adjunctive RLAT (p = 0.010). Relapse rates were 23.1 (n = 15) with adjunctive RLAT versus 45.8 (n = 27) with adjunctive placebo; relative relapse risk was 2.3-fold higher with adjunctive placebo (p = 0.011). Completion rates were: adjunctive RLAT, 60.0 (n = 39) and adjunctive placebo, 42.4 (n = 25; p = 0.050). Adverse event (AE)-related discontinuations were 4.6 (n = 3) and 1.7 (n = 1), respectively. Common AEs (adjunctive RLAT versus adjunctive placebo) were: tremor (24.6 versus 10.2 ), insomnia (20.0 versus 18.6 ), muscle rigidity (12.3 versus 5.1 ), weight increased (6.2 versus 1.7 ), and hypokinesia (7.7 versus 0.0 ). Conclusions: Adjunctive RLAT significantly delayed time to relapse in patients with bipolar disorder type I who relapse frequently. Safety and tolerability of RLAT were generally consistent with that previously observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

859,The Timing of Antidepressant Effects: A Comparison of Diverse Pharmacological and Somatic Treatments,"Currently available antidepressants used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) unfortunately often take weeks to months to achieve their full effects, commonly resulting in considerable morbidity and increased risk for suicidal behavior. Our lack of understanding of the precise cellular underpinnings of this illness and of the mechanism of action of existing effective pharmacological treatments is a large part of the reason that therapies with a more rapid onset of antidepressant action (ROAA) have not been developed. Other issues that need to be addressed include heterogeneous clinical concepts and statistical models to measure rapid antidepressant effects. This review describes the timing of onset of antidepressant effects for various therapies used to treat MDD. While several agents produce earlier improvement of depressive symptoms (defined as occurring within one week), the response rate associated with such agents can be quite variable. These agents include both currently available antidepressants as well as other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

860,Rapid onset of antidepressant action: A new paradigm in the research and treatment of major depressive disorder,"Objective: Current therapeutics of depression are similar in their time to antidepressant action and often take weeks to months to achieve response and remission, which commonly results in considerable morbidity and disruption in personal, professional, family, and social life, as well as risk for suicidal behavior. Thus, treatment strategies presenting a rapid improvement of depressive symptoms--within hours or even a few days--and whose effects are sustained would have an enormous impact on public health. This article reviews the published data related to different aspects of rapid improvement of depressive symptoms. Data Sources: Literature for this review was obtained through a search of the MEDLINE database (1966-2007) using the following keywords and phrases: rapid response, antidepressant, time to, glutamate, sleep, therapeutics, latency, and depression. The data obtained were organized according to the following topics: clinical relevance and time course of antidepressant action, interventions showing evidence of rapid response and its potential neurobiological basis, and new technologies for better understanding rapid antidepressant actions. Data Synthesis: A limited number of prospective studies evaluating rapid antidepressant actions have been conducted. Currently, only a few interventions have been shown to produce antidepressant response in hours or a few days. The neurobiological basis of these rapid antidepressant actions is only now being deciphered. Conclusions: Certain experimental treatments can produce antidepressant response in a much shorter period of time than existing medications. Understanding the molecular basis of these experimental interventions is likely to lead to the development of improved therapeutics rather than simply furthering our knowledge of current standard antidepressants.

861,Mania Curing Fever?,"Letter to the editor describes a very interesting case of Ms B. Ms. B., a 14-year-old girl who presented to the Emergency Department with a one week history of persistent insomnia, increased goal directed activity, pressured and circumstantial speech, provocative behavior, grandiosity, irritability, auditory hallucinations, delusional ideation, lack of appetite, and suicidal ideation. She was previously diagnosed with a major depressive disorder 1 1/2 years prior and treated with paroxetine. Ms. B. was admitted to hospital and initially treated with risperidone, divalproex sodium and temazepam. But her symptoms kept worsening and the medications also kept changing accordingly. On day 21 she developed further symptoms of fever and influenza. All medications were held. On day 21 her mental status dramatically normalized. Two days later (day 23) manic symptoms returned and lithium carbonate was started. She was not restarted on an antipsychotic. She was eventually discharged with manic symptoms under very good control 2 1/2 months after admission. This resolution of the patient's phenomenology and brief return to normal mental status with excellent insight was remarkable, but short lived.

862,Cognitive and Adaptive Behavior Profiles in Smith-Magenis Syndrome,"Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation syndrome associated with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 17 band p11.2. The incidence of this microdeletion syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 25,000 individuals. Persons with SMS have a distinctive neurobehavioral phenotype that is characterized by aggressive and self-injurious behaviors and significant sleep disturbances. From December 1990 through September 1999, 58 persons with SMS were enrolled in a 5-day multidisciplinary clinical protocol. Developmental assessments consisting of cognitive level and adaptive behavior were completed in 57 persons. Most patients functioned in the mild-to-moderate range of mental retardation. In addition, we report that patients with SMS have low adaptive functioning with relative strengths in socialization and relative weakness in daily living skills. These data were analyzed in light of the molecular extent of the microdeletion within 17p11.2. We found that the level of cognitive and adaptive functioning does depend on deletion size, and that a small percentage of SMS patients have cognitive function in the borderline range.

863,Acute depression and suicidal attempt following lowering the frequency of deep brain stimulation,"Presents a case of a 66â€“yearâ€“old male who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 20 years ago and was implanted with a subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment system bilaterally for the last 8 years. Four years later, he developed a major depressive episode after his retirement and responded well to an adequate trial of bupropion. He did not report prior history of suicidal thoughts or attempts and followed up regularly with a psychiatrist. Reportedly, for the last 5 years his neurologist had been changing the frequency of the brain stimulation through the implanted devices to negate the patient's changing dyskinetic symptoms and disease progression. The patient developed acute depression and made a serious suicide attempt by overdosing on sleeping pills. He was admitted to an intensive care unit and transferred to a psychiatric facility. His neurologist reportedly increased the frequency while the patient was in the hospital, and accordingly, his depressive feelings improved.

864,The phenomenology and correlates of flashbacks in individuals with posttraumatic stress symptoms,"Reexperiencing symptoms are a hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Relatively little research has examined flashbacks in individuals with PTSD, and theoretical attempts to define and conceptualize flashbacks continue to be marked by considerable controversy. We compared individuals with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD symptoms (PTSS) with (n = 45) and without flashbacks (n = 32) to trauma-exposed controls (n = 33) and control participants without trauma exposure (n = 33). We compared the qualities of flashbacks of individuals with PTSS to those simulated by individuals without flashbacks. As predicted, individuals with PTSS reported significantly greater sleep disturbances, experiential avoidance, and lower trait mindfulness than those without PTSS. Individuals without PTSS underestimated the vividness, emotional intensity, distress, and functional impact associated with flashbacks. Consistent with basic-mechanisms theory, we did not find evidence of fragmentation of flashbacks in individuals with PTSS.

865,The association between sleep disturbances and suicidal behaviors in patients with psychiatric diagnoses: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Identifying patients with increased risk of suicidal behaviors is a constant challenge and concern for clinicians caring for patients with psychiatric conditions. We conducted a systematic review to assess the association between suicidal behaviors and sleep disturbances in psychiatric patients.; Methods: A systematic literature search of Ovid Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid PsycInfo, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus was conducted using earliest inclusive dates to 28 June 2013. Eligible studies were comparative observational studies that reported sleep disturbances in psychiatric patients and the outcome of interest (any type of suicidal behaviors). Pairs of reviewers extracted descriptive data, study quality, and outcomes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled across studies using the random-effects model. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to critically appraise study quality.; Results: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared to those without sleep disturbances, patients with psychiatric diagnoses and co-morbid sleep disturbances were significantly more likely to report suicidal behaviors (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.99, 95% CI 1.72, 2.30, P <0.001). The association was also demonstrated across several psychiatric conditions including depression (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.05, 95% CI 2.07, 4.48, P <0.001), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.56, 95% CI 1.91, 3.43, P <0.001), panic disorder (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.22, 95% CI 1.09, 9.45, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), and schizophrenia (ORâ€‰=â€‰12.66, 95% CI 1.40, 114.44, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). In subgroup analysis based on the type of sleep disorder, we also found suicidal behavior to be significantly associated with the presence of insomnia, parasomnias, and sleep-related breathing disorders, but not hypersomnias.; Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that in patients with psychiatric diagnoses, sleep disturbances are associated with the increased risk of suicidal behaviors.;Mental Disorders/*complications, Sleep Wake Disorders/*complications, Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Humans, Mental Disorders/psychology, Risk Factors, Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology, Suicide/psychology","Malik, Shaista; Kanwar, Amrit; Sim, Leslie A; Prokop, Larry J; Wang, Zhen; Benkhadra, Khalid & Murad, Mohammad Hassan",0,865

867,"Tobacco smoking is associated with antipsychotic medication, physical aggressiveness, and alcohol use disorder in schizophrenia: results from the FACE-SZ national cohort","Tobacco smoking is common in schizophrenia and is one of the main causes of premature mortality in this disorder. Little is known about clinical correlates and treatments associated with tobacco smoking in patients with schizophrenia. Still, a better characterization of these patients is necessary, in a personalized care approach. Aggressiveness and childhood trauma have been associated with tobacco smoking in general population, but this association has never been explored in schizophrenia. Our study examines the clinical and therapeutic characteristics of tobacco smoking in schizophrenia. 474 stabilized patients (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰32.2; 75.7% male gender; smokers nâ€‰=â€‰207, 54.6%) were consecutively included in the network of the FondaMental Expert centers for Schizophrenia and assessed with valid scales. Current tobacco status was self-declared. Aggressiveness was self-reported with Buss-Perry Aggressiveness Questionnaire and Childhood Trauma with Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Ongoing treatment was reported. In univariate analysis, tobacco smoking was associated with lower education level (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), positive syndrome (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), higher physical aggressiveness (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), alcohol dependence (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and First Generation Antipsychotics (FGAs) use (pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). In a multivariate model, tobacco smoking remained associated with physical aggressiveness (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), current alcohol dependence (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and FGA use (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). No association was observed with childhood trauma history, mood disorder, suicidal behavior, psychotic symptom, global functioning or medication adherence. Patients with tobacco use present clinical and therapeutic specificities, questioning the neurobiological links between tobacco and schizophrenia. They could represent a specific phenotype, with specific clinical and therapeutic specificities that may involve interactions between cholinergic-nicotinic system and dopaminergic system. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the potential efficacy of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) on tobacco use in schizophrenia and to develop effective strategies for tobacco cessation in this population.; Aggressiveness, Alcohol dependence, Antipsychotics, Childhood trauma, Schizophrenia, Tobacco smoking","Mallet, J.; Le Strat, Y.; SchÃ¼rhoff, F.; Mazer, N.; Portalier, C.; Andrianarisoa, M.; Aouizerate, B.; Berna, F.; Brunel, L.; Capdevielle, D.; Chereau, I.; D'Amato, T.; Dubreucq, J.; Faget, C.; Gabayet, F.; Honciuc, R.

868,Ketamine for Treatment of Suicidal Ideation and Reduction of Risk for Suicidal Behavior,"Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist with efficacy as a rapid anti-depressant, has early evidence for action to reduce suicidal ideation. This review will explore several important questions that arise from these studies. First, how do we measure reductions in suicidal ideation that occur over minutes to hours? Second, are the reductions in suicidal ideation after ketamine treatment solely a result of its rapid anti-depressant effect? Third, is ketamine only effective in reducing suicidal ideation in patients with mood disorders? Fourth, could ketamine's action lead us to a greater understanding of the neurobiology of suicidal processes? Last, do the reductions in depression and suicidal ideation after ketamine treatment translate into decreased risk for suicidal behavior? Our review concludes that ketamine treatment can be seen as a double-edged sword, clinically to help provide treatment for acutely suicidal patients and experimentally to explore the neurobiological nature of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.; Suicidal Ideation*, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Ketamine/*therapeutic use, Mood Disorders/*drug therapy, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*antagonists & inhibitors, Suicide/*prevention & control, Depression/drug therapy, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Humans, Mood Disorders/psychology, Suicide, Attempted/prevention & control, Depression, Ketamine, Mood disorders, RDoC domains, Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Ideation Assessment Scales, Suicidal attempt","Mallick, Faryal & McCullumsmith, Cheryl B.",0,868
869,Is usage of hypnotics associated with mortality?,"Objective: To investigate the influence of hypnotic usage on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a middle-aged population. Methods: A cohort of 1750 men and 1773 women aged 30-65 years who responded to a postal questionnaire in 1983. The questionnaire included questions about hypnotic usage, sleep duration, sleep complaints, medical conditions, depression, demographic and life style variables. Mortality data for the period 1983-2003 were collected. Results: Regular hypnotic usage was reported by 1.7% of men and 2.2% of women, and was associated with short sleep, sleeping difficulties, several health problems and depression. During the 20-year follow-up period 379 men (21.5%) and 278 women (15.5%) died. After adjustment for potential risk factors in multivariate analyses regular hypnotic usage was associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality in men (Hazard ratios [HR], 4.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.47-8.37) and in women 2.03 (95% CI, 1.07-3.86). With regard to cause-specific mortality, regular hypnotic usage in men was a risk factor for coronary artery disease death, cancer death, suicide and death from â€˜â€˜all remaining causes.â€ In women it was a risk factor for suicide. Conclusions: Our results show an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in regular users of hypnotics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

870,Electronic Medical Record Alert Associated With Reduced Opioid and Benzodiazepine Coprescribing in High-risk Veteran Patients,"Background: Over the past decade, overdoses involving opioids and benzodiazepines have risen at alarming rates, making reductions in coprescribing of these medications a priority, particularly among patients who may be susceptible to adverse events due to high-risk conditions.; Objectives: This quality improvement project evaluated the effectiveness of a medication alert designed to reduce opioid and benzodiazepine coprescribing among Veterans with known high-risk conditions (substance use, sleep apnea, suicide-risk, age 65 and above) at 1 Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.; Methods: Prescribers were exposed to the point-of-prescribing alert for 12 months. For each high-risk cohort we used interrupted time series design to examine population trends in coprescribing 12 months after alert launch adjusting for coprescribing 12 months before launch, demographics and clinical covariates. Trends at the alert site were compared with those of a similar VA health care system without the alert. Secondary analyses examined population trends in opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing separately.; Results: Over 12 months, the alert activated for 1332 patients. Proportions of patients with concurrent prescriptions decreased significantly postalert launch among substance use [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.96-0.99; 12-month decrease=25.0%], sleep apnea (AOR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, 12-month decrease=38.5%), and suicide-risk (AOR=0.94, 95% CI=0.91-0.98, 12-month decrease=61.5%) cohorts at the alert site. Decreases in coprescribing were significantly different from the comparison site among suicide-risk (AOR=0.92, 95% CI=0.86-0.97) and sleep apnea (AOR=0.98, 95% CI=0.96-1.00) cohorts.

871,CBT for insomnia in patients with high and low depressive symptom severity: adherence and clinical outcomes,"Study Objectives: To evaluate whether depressive symptom severity leads to poorer response and perceived adherence to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and to examine the impact of CBTI on well-being, depressive symptom severity, and suicidal ideation.; Design: Pre- to posttreatment case replication series comparing low depression (LowDep) and high depression (HiDep) groups (based on a cutoff of 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]).; Participants: 127 men and 174 women referred for the treatment of insomnia.; Interventions: Seven sessions of group CBTI.; Measurements and Results: Improvement in the insomnia severity, perceived energy, productivity, self-esteem, other aspects of wellbeing, and overall treatment satisfaction did not differ between the HiDep and LowDep groups (p > 0.14). HiDep patients reported lower adherence to a fixed rise time, restricting time in bed, and changing expectations about sleep (p < 0.05). HiDep participants experienced significant reductions in BDI, after removing the sleep item. Levels of suicidal ideation dropped significantly among patients with pretreatment elevations (p < 0.0001).; Conclusion: Results suggest that pre- to post CBTI improvements in insomnia symptoms, perceived energy, productivity, self-esteem, and other aspects of well-being were similar among patients with and without elevation in depressive symptom severity. Thus, the benefits of CBTI extend beyond insomnia and include improvements in non-sleep outcomes, such as overall well-being and depressive symptom severity, including suicidal ideation, among patients with baseline elevations. Results identify aspects of CBTI that may merit additional attention to further improve outcomes among patients with insomnia and elevated depressive symptom severity.;Cognitive Therapy/*methods, Depressive Disorder/*complications, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*complications, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*drug therapy, Cohort Studies, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Patient Compliance, Patient Satisfaction, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Assessment, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, Suicidal Ideation, Treatment Outcome, CBTI, Insomnia, depression, nonpharmacological treatment, suicide ideation","Manber, Rachel; Bernert, Rebecca A; Suh, Sooyeon; Nowakowski, Sara; Siebern, Allison T & Ong, Jason C",1,871
872,Persistent sleep disturbance is associated with treatment response in adolescents with depression,"Background: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in adolescents with depressive disorders. To date there is limited evidence of the extent to which sleep disturbances are associated with treatment response in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the extent to which self-reported sleep disturbances are associated with treatment response in adolescents with depression. Method: Sleep data were gathered from a sample of 166 adolescents (aged 12-18 years) with a diagnosis of a DSM-IV depressive disorder who underwent 3 months of treatment (psychosocial and/or pharmacotherapy (sertraline)) in community- based research programs. The subjective report of sleep disturbance within depressive disorders was assessed using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children at three time points: pretreatment, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Results: Sixty-nine percent of participants had a sleep disturbance pre-treatment and approximately 75% of these participants had threshold symptoms. Threshold sleep disturbances that persisted from pre- to post-treatment assessments were positively associated with depression at the 6-month follow-up. An ordered logistic regression model controlling for gender, treatment group and comorbid anxiety estimated a 70% risk of depression or partial remission for those with persistent sleep disturbance. Treatment group, anxiety and gender generally had no significant effect on the relationship between sleep and depression. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances were highly related to depressive state and were associated with poorer treatment response in adolescents with depression. These results provide a rationale for further exploration of sleep-related treatments for adolescents with depression. Knowledge of patient-reported persistent sleep disturbances can help clinicians to predict treatment outcomes and may direct them to augment treatment or focus on sleep-related treatment strategies.

Methods: Data from 20,552 persons aged 16 years and above (males 45.9%), was obtained using stratified, random sampling in a national survey of psychiatric morbidity using locally validated General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) which included questions on suicidal ideation. Results: The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) was 6.3%, CI 6.1-6.8 (n = 1288). Logistic regression analysis was performed with age, ethnicity, gender, urban/rural residence, age group, marital status, household income, type of household, presence of chronic pain, social dysfunction, somatic, anxiety or depressive symptoms, obesity, and chronic medical illnesses as independent variables. Only Insomnia, Religion, Marital Status, Depression, Social Dysfunction and Anxiety were seen to be significant predictors. Prevalence of SI was significantly higher among Indians (11.0%, CI 9.5-12.5), especially those of the Hindu faith (12.2%, CI 10.5-14.0), Chinese (9.7%, CI 8.8-10.7) and those having depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In a developing country with competing priorities, prudent allocation of resources requires focusing suicide prevention efforts on treating depression in vulnerable groups.

It can destroy the enjoyment of life and the opportunity to continue in employment. In some cases, it can lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Nurses are well placed to become more effective in identifying and treating this challenging condition. This article outlines what we currently understand are the causes or 'generators' of neuropathic pain and the mechanisms that maintain pain. It explores strategies for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain and reviews a couple of typical case studies from clinical practice. Using these case studies, this article discusses assessment, patient expectation, treatment options and realistic outcomes.

875,A life less lonely: the state of the art in interventions to reduce loneliness in people with mental health problems,"Purpose: There is growing evidence of significant harmful effects of loneliness. Relatively little work has focused on how best to reduce loneliness in people with mental health problems. We aim to present an overview of the current state of the art in loneliness interventions in people with mental health problems, identify relevant challenges, and highlight priorities for future research and implementation.; Methods: A scoping review of the published and grey literature was conducted, as well as discussions with relevant experts, to propose a broad classification system for types of interventions targeting loneliness.; Results: We categorised interventions as 'direct', targeting loneliness and related concepts in social relationships, and 'indirect' broader approaches to well-being that may impact on loneliness. We describe four broad groups of direct interventions: changing cognitions; social skills training and psychoeducation; supported socialisation or having a 'socially-focused supporter'; and 'wider community approaches'. The most promising emerging evidence appears to be in 'changing cognitions', but, as yet, no approaches have a robust evidence base. Challenges include who is best placed to offer the intervention, how to test such complex interventions, and the stigma surrounding loneliness.; Conclusions: Development of clearly defined loneliness interventions, high-quality trials of effectiveness, and identifying which approaches work best for whom is required. Promising future approaches may include wider community initiatives and social prescribing. It is important to place loneliness and social relationships high on the wider public mental health and research agenda.; Loneliness/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*psychology, Humans, Social Support, Socialization, Intervention*, Loneliness*, Social isolation*, Social networks*, Social prescribing*","Mann, Farhana; Bone, Jessica K.; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Frerichs, Johanna; Pinfold, Vanessa; Ma, Ruimin; Wang, Jingyi & Johnson, Sonia",0,875
876,Child sexual abuse as reported by Israeli adolescents: Social and health related correlates,"The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of child sexual abuse (CSA) in a nation-wide representative sample of 14-17 year old Israeli adolescents, and to examine the associations between CSA, socio-demographic correlates and various measures of physical and mental health. The study population consisted of 906 mother-adolescent dyads, belonging to a community based, representative sample of Israeli 14-17 year olds, interviewed in 2004-5. Response rate was 68%. Subjects provided demographic data, and information about CSA, physical symptoms, body image, well-being and use of mental health services. DAWBA was used to obtain information regarding mental disorders and suicidality. SDQ was used to obtain data on bullying. Statistical analyses were conducted using an SPSS-17 complex sample analysis module and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the associations between CSA and risk factors and social and health related correlates. Findings show that CSA was reported by 3.3% of adolescents. Higher risk of exposure to CSA was found among girls, among adolescents living in a one-parent household and among adolescents with a chronic disability. In multivariate models adjusting for gender, learning disabilities and depression, CSA was associated with suicidal attempts, stomach ache, dizziness, sleep problems, well being at home and bullying behaviors. No association was found with suicidal ideation or other physical symptoms. Our findings confirm that the associations between CSA and different outcomes vary depending on the socio-psychological context, and underline the importance of addressing the complexity of variables associated with CSA.

877,Mild traumatic brain injury chronically impairs sleep- and wake-dependent emotional processing,"Study Objectives: A single traumatic brain injury (TBI), even when mild (ie, concussion), can cause lasting consequences. Individuals with a history of chronic (> 1-year prior) mild TBI have an increased risk of mood disturbances (eg, depression, suicide). This population also has lingering sleep alterations, including poor sleep quality and changes in sleep stage proportions. Given these sleep deficits, we aimed to test whether sleep-dependent emotional memory consolidation is reduced in this population. We utilized a mild TBI group (3.7 Â± 2.9 years post injury) and an uninjured (non-TBI) population. Methods: Participants viewed negative and neutral images both before and after a 12-hour period containing sleep ('Sleep' group) or an equivalent period of time spent awake ('Wake' group). Participants rated images for valence/arousal at both sessions, and memory recognition was tested at session two. Results: The TBI group had less rapid eye movement (REM), longer REM latency, and more sleep complaints. Sleep-dependent memory consolidation of nonemotional images was present in all participants. However, consolidation of negative images was only present in the non-TBI group. A lack of differentiation between the TBI Sleep and Wake groups was due to poor performance in the sleep group and, unexpectedly, enhanced performance in the wake group. Additionally, although the non-TBI participants habituated to negative images over a waking period, the TBI participants did not. Conclusions: We propose disrupted sleep- and wake-dependent emotional processing contributes to poor emotional outcomes following chronic, mild TBI. This work has broad implications, as roughly one-third of the US population will sustain a mild TBI during their lifetime.

After 1 wk of placebo (single blind), 142 outpatients affected by major depression with relevant anxiety and agitation were randomly assigned (double blind) to either FX or amitriptyline (AM) for a period of 10 wks. Between groups, the mean score of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was significantly different only after 3 wks of treatment, whereas at the end of the trial it was similar. At each visit, no significant difference between groups was found regarding the scores of the HRSD items psychic anxiety somatic anxiety agitation."" Furthermore the FX treatment did not increase the scores of the items ""suicide psychic anxiety somatic anxiety agitation"" and ""insomnia."" These findings suggest that Ss affected by major depression with anxiety and/or agitation were effectively and safely treated with FX without increasing risks.

879,Predictors of improved mood over time in clinical trials for major depression,"The objective of this exploratory analysis was to use a repeated measures modeling approach to identify potential predictors of improved mood over time in patients with major depression. Fifty-one subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled in a 1-week single blind placebo lead-in, followed by an 8-week, double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with either fluoxetine or venlafaxine. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to identify baseline and placebo lead-in predictors of change in repeated measures of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) during treatment. Non-specific predictors of improved mood included decreased prefrontal activity during placebo lead-in as measured by quantitative electroencephalographic cordance, lower pretreatment depressed mood on the HDRS, shorter duration of current episode, increased verbalization of suicidal thoughts, no family history of mood disorders, less severe middle insomnia, higher guilt, lower somatic anxiety, and younger age. Moderators of improved mood included somatization, paranoid ideation, and self-reported depressed mood. We also found that change in prefrontal cordance after randomization mediated the effects of middle insomnia, suicidal thoughts, and family history of mood disorders. We recommend the use of repeated measures modeling, and the exploration of relationships among biological and psychological factors, for future analyses of clinical trial data.; Copyright 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.Affect*, Cyclohexanols/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis, Fluoxetine/*therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Adult, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography, Female, Humans, Male, Prospective Studies, Single-Blind Method, Surveys and Questionnaires, Venlafaxine Hydrochloride","Marie-Mitchell, Ariane; Leuchter, Andrew F; Chou, Chih-Ping; James Gauderman, W & Azen, Stanley P",0,879
880,Nightmares and suicide: predicting risk in depression,"Background: There is growing evidence of an association of a number of subjective and objective sleep parameters (especially nightmares) and elevated suicidal risk in different clinical populations as well as in the general populations.; Subjects and Methods: This is a cross-sectional naturalistic study of 52 inpatients (28 females and 24 males, aged from 24 to 75 years) meeting criteria for a current depressive episode within Recurrent Depressive Disorder (RDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) according to ICD-10. All patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), followed by a direct interview about their dreams' content and emotional charge, as well as about suicidal thoughts and plans or previous attempts.; Results: Patients with RDD suffered significantly more frequently from nightmares than those with BD, p<0.05. Within the RDD group, experiencing nightmares was associated with significantly higher scores on the HDRS suicide risk item (2.36 vs 1.00), higher frequency of suicide attempts (35% vs 6%), and lower likelihood for lack of detectable suicide risk (21% vs 81%), p<0.05. These differences were not explained by significant difference in the severity of depressive symptoms (28.00 vs 24.75, p=0.16). We were unable to detect such differences in the bipolar subgroup. No gender influences on the association of nightmares and suicidal risk were observed.; Conclusions: Depressed patients suffering from nightmares showed significantly higher suicide risk. Depression appeared to be a stronger risk factor for suicidal behavior when accompanied with nightmares. This was only valid for unipolar depression, while the results concerning bipolar depression were inconclusive.;Bipolar Disorder/*psychology, Depressive Disorder/*psychology, Dreams/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Recurrence, Risk Factors, Young Adult","Marinova, Petra; Koychev, Ivan; Laleva, Lili; Kancheva, Lyudmila; Tsvetkov, Milen; Bilyukov, Radoslav; Vandeva, Diana; Felthouse, Alan & Koychev, Georgi",1,880
881,Predictors of future suicide attempt among adolescents with suicidal thoughts or non-suicidal self-harm: A population-based birth cohort study,"Suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm are common in adolescents and are strongly associated with suicide attempts. We aimed to identify predictors of future suicide attempts in these high-risk groups. METHODS: Participants were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population-based birth cohort study in the UK. The sample included 456 adolescents who reported suicidal thoughts and 569 who reported non-suicidal self-harm at 16 years of age. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore associations between a wide range of prospectively recorded risk factors and future suicide attempts, assessed at the age of 21 years. FINDINGS: 38 (12%) of 310 participants with suicidal thoughts and 46 (12%) of 380 participants who had engaged in non-suicidal self-harm reported having attempted suicide for the first time by the follow-up at 21 years of age. Among participants with suicidal thoughts, the strongest predictors of transition to attempts were non-suicidal self-harm (odds ratio [OR] 2Â·78, 95% CI 1Â·35â€'5Â·74; p=0Â·0059), cannabis use (2Â·61, 1Â·11â€'6Â·14; p=0Â·029), other illicit drug use (2Â·47, 1Â·02â€'5Â·96; p=0Â·045), exposure to self-harm (family 2Â·03, 0Â·93â€'4Â·44, p=0Â·076; friend 1Â·85, 0Â·93â€'3Â·69, p=0Â·081), and higher levels of the personality type intellect/openness (1Â·62, 1Â·06â€'2Â·46; p=0Â·025). Among participants with non-suicidal self-harm at baseline, the strongest predictors were cannabis use (OR 2Â·14, 95% CI 1Â·04â€'4Â·41; p=0Â·038), other illicit drug use (2Â·17, 1Â·10â€'4Â·27; p=0Â·025), sleep problems (waking in the night 1Â·91, 0Â·95â€'3Â·84, p=0Â·069; insufficient sleep 1Â·97, 1Â·02â€'3Â·81, p=0Â·043), and lower levels of the personality type extraversion (0Â·71, 0Â·49â€'1Â·03; p=0Â·068). INTERPRETATION: Most adolescents who think about suicide or engage in non-suicidal self-harm will not make an attempt on their life. Many commonly cited risk factors were not associated with transition to suicide attempt among these high-risk groups. Our findings suggest that asking about substance use, non-suicidal self-harm, sleep, personality traits, and exposure to self-harm could inform risk assessments, and might help clinicians to identify which adolescents are at greatest risk of attempting suicide in the future.

882,Psychosocial and clinical characteristics of depressive patients with the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome,"There is a growing quantity of data showing that mental illnesses affect the somatic health. Depression is a complex disease, connected with the disturbances of sleep-cycle, appetite, body weight and level of physical activity, all of which may represent the risk factors for the development of metabolic disturbances. In the depressive patients, there is a number of various physiological mechanisms and psychosocial factors which may influence the development of metabolic syndrome (MS), such as sex, age, smoking, stress levels, nutrition and level of physical activity. It is considered that chronic stress causes depression and the resulting bad life habits may lead to MS and finally KVB. Aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial and clinical features of depressive patients with the diagnosis of MS. The cross-reference study has been done at the sample of 80 patients diagnosed with MS. Among the diagnostic instruments applied, we have used the structured socio-demographic questionnaire, MINI questionnaire, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome had been established following the NCEP ATP criteria. Among the depressive patients, there were 38.8% who fulfilled the criteria for establishing the diagnosis of MS. There was a greater incidence of suicide among the depressive patients with the diagnosis of MS. The diagnose was more frequently established in depressive women, while an increased intake of carbohydrates represented a significant feature of both depression and MS. Further research is needed to explain the observed gender differences and to determine if the interventions aimed to treating the depression can also contribute to accepting the healthy life habits and as a consequence, indirectly reduce the incidence of MS.

883,EPA guidance on mental health and economic crises in Europe,"This European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance paper is a result of the Working Group on Mental Health Consequences of Economic Crises of the EPA Council of National Psychiatric Associations. Its purpose is to identify the impact on mental health in Europe of the economic downturn and the measures that may be taken to respond to it. We performed a review of the existing literature that yields 350 articles on which our conclusions and recommendations are based. Evidence-based tables and recommendations were developed through an expert consensus process. Literature dealing with the consequences of economic turmoil on the health and health behaviours of the population is heterogeneous, and the results are not completely unequivocal. However, there is a broad consensus about the deleterious consequences of economic crises on mental health, particularly on psychological well-being, depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, alcohol abuse, and suicidal behaviour. Unemployment, indebtedness, precarious working conditions, inequalities, lack of social connectedness, and housing instability emerge as main risk factors. Men at working age could be particularly at risk, together with previous low SES or stigmatized populations. Generalized austerity measures and poor developed welfare systems trend to increase the harmful effects of economic crises on mental health. Although many articles suggest limitations of existing research and provide suggestions for future research, there is relatively little discussion of policy approaches to address the negative impact of economic crises on mental health. The few studies that addressed policy questions suggested that the development of social protection programs such as active labour programs, social support systems, protection for housing instability, and better access to mental health care, particularly at primary care level, is strongly needed.

884,Self-harm and risk of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers: findings from the DRIVE Study,"Background: Some motor vehicle crashes, particularly single-vehicle crashes, may result from intentional self-harm. We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the risk that intentional self-harm poses for motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.; Methods: We prospectively linked survey data from newly licensed drivers aged 17-24 years to data on licensing attempts and police-reported motor vehicle crashes during the follow-up period. We investigated the role of recent engagement in self-harm on the risk of a crash. We took into account potential confounders, including number of hours of driving per week, psychological symptoms and substance abuse.; Results: We included 18 871 drivers who participated in the DRIVE Study for whom data on self-harm and motor vehicle crashes were available. The mean follow-up was 2 years. Overall, 1495 drivers had 1 or more crashes during the follow-up period. A total of 871 drivers (4.6%) reported that they had engaged in self-harm in the year before the survey. These drivers were at significantly increased risk of a motor vehicle crash compared with drivers who reported no self-harm (relative risk [RR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-1.76). The risk remained significant, even after adjustment for age, sex, average hours of driving per week, previous crash, psychological distress, duration of sleep, risky driving behaviour, substance use, remoteness of residence and socio-economic status (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.72). Most of the drivers who reported self-harm and had a subsequent crash were involved in a multiple-vehicle crash (84.1% [74/88]).; Interpretation: Engagement in self-harm behaviour was an independent risk factor for subsequent motor vehicle crash among young drivers, with most crashes involving multiple vehicles.;Accidents, Traffic/*psychology, Self-Injurious Behavior/*epidemiology, Adolescent, Alcohol Drinking/psychology, Automobile Driving/psychology, Confidence Intervals, Female, Humans, Male, New South Wales/epidemiology, Poisson Distribution, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Factors, Self-Injurious Behavior/psychology, Sleep, Substance-Related Disorders/psychology, Young Adult","Martiniuk, Alexandra L C; Ivers, Rebecca Q; Glozier, Nick; Patton, George C; Lam, Lawrence T; Boufous, Soufiane; Senserrick, Teresa; Williamson, Ann; Stevenson, Mark & Norton, Robyn",1,884
885,Tourette Syndrome and Chronic Tic Disorders: The Clinical Spectrum Beyond Tics,"The clinical surveillance and active management of Tourette syndrome (TS) and other primary chronic tic disorders cannot be limited to tics, as these patients manifest a spectrum of sensory-, behavioral-, cognitive-, and sleep-related problems that have a major impact on their functioning and quality of life, influencing enormously clinical decision making on a routine basis. The sensory phenomena of primary tic disorders consist of premonitory urges and heightened sensitivity to external somatosensory and interoceptive stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that raised interoceptive awareness may be related to the classical premonitory urges associated with tics. The burden of behavioral comorbidities is very important in determining the degree of disability of patients with primary tic disorders. Only 10%-15% of these patients presents exclusively with a tic disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are common in TS, and the clinical distinction between compulsions and complex tics may be difficult in some cases. Tic-related OCD"" represents a phenomenologically characteristic subtype of OCD also associated with ""just right"" phenomena. Probably the presence of comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the main determinant of cognitive dysfunction in TS patients and influences heavily also the risk of developing disruptive behaviors. Mood and anxiety disorders impulse control disorders rage attacks ""impulsive"" tic-like behaviors (e.g. nonobscene socially inappropriate behaviors and self-injurious behaviors) and autism spectrum disorders complete the wide psychopathological spectrum of primary chronic tic disorders. Moreover specific sleep abnormalities have been reported in TS patients although more research is needed on this specific clinical problem. As in other areas of clinical neuroscience a comprehensive approach to both motor and nonmotor aspects of this group of disorders will help personalizing treatment interventions and ultimately improve quality of care.; Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

886,The neurobiology of adaptation to seasons: Relevance and correlations in bipolar disorders,"Bipolar disorders (BDs) are severe and common psychiatric disorders. BD pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and relapses are associated with numerous circadian rhythm abnormalities. In addition, infradian fluctuations of mood, social activity, weight and sleep patterns are very frequent in BD. Disease course with a seasonal pattern (SP) occurs in approximately 25% of depressive and 15% of manic episodes, which is coupled to a more severe disease symptomatology. The pathophysiological mechanisms of seasonal effects in BD await clarification, with likely important clinical consequences. This review aims at synthesizing available data regarding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of seasonality in BD patients, with implications for future research directions in the study of seasonality in BD. Three factors are suggested to play significant roles in BD with SP, namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei, as well as the melatonergic and photoperiodism systems. It is proposed that BD with SP may be considered as a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of clock gene vulnerabilities and biological clock neuroplasticity, with environmental factors, such as the response to light. Light seems to play a key role in BD with SP, mainly due to two seasonal signaling pathways: a light to cortex serotonin transporter pathway, as well as a pathway connecting light to melatonin synthesis. This provides a theoretical framework for BD with SP, including for future research and clinical management. The review proposes that future research should explore markers of seasonality in BD, such as plasma melatonin, sleepâ€“wake rhythms (with actigraphy) and genetic or epigenetic variants within the melatonin synthesis pathway. The role of light in driving BD with SP is an active area of research. Seasonality may also be intimately linked to wider aspects of BD, including via interactions with the gut microbiome, the gutâ€“liver axis, cholesterol regulation, aspects of metabolic syndrome, vitamin D, decreased longevity, suicide risk and medication treatment targets. Further research on the role of seasonality in BD is likely to clarify the etiology, course and treatment of BD more widely.

887,"Effects of the potential lithium-mimetic, ebselen, on impulsivity and emotional processing","Rationale: Lithium remains the most effective treatment for bipolar disorder and also has important effects to lower suicidal behaviour, a property that may be linked to its ability to diminish impulsive, aggressive behaviour. The antioxidant drug, ebselen, has been proposed as a possible lithium-mimetic based on its ability in animals to inhibit inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), an action which it shares with lithium. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine whether treatment with ebselen altered emotional processing and diminished measures of risk-taking behaviour. Methods: We studied 20 healthy participants who were tested on two occasions receiving either ebselen (3600 mg over 24 h) or identical placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Three hours after the final dose of ebselen/placebo, participants completed the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) and a task that required the detection of emotional facial expressions (facial emotion recognition task (FERT)). Results: On the CGT, relative to placebo, ebselen reduced delay aversion while on the FERT, it increased the recognition of positive vs negative facial expressions. Conclusions: The study suggests that at the dosage used, ebselen can decrease impulsivity and produce a positive bias in emotional processing. These findings have implications for the possible use of ebselen in the disorders characterized by impulsive behaviour and dysphoric mood.

888,Aripiprazole monotherapy in children and young adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders: A retrospective study,"Background: Pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are severe psychiatric disorders characterized by impairment in social interactions, in verbal and non-verbal communication, and by restricted and stereotyped patterns of interest and behaviour, with onset in the first 3 years of life. The appropriate use of pharmacotherapy can improve some aberrant symptoms and behaviours and increase the person's response to non-pharmacological interventions. Objective: To describe clinical outcomes, or symptom changes, and adverse effects during naturalistic treatment with aripiprazole monotherapy in children with PDDs and severe behavioural disorders (such as aggression against self and/or others, hostility, hyperactivity, severe impulsiveness). Method: This retrospective naturalistic study included 34 patients (23 males and 11 females, age range 4.5-15 years, mean age 10.2 - 3.3 years), admitted during 2006-2007, diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and followed up for 4-12 months (mean 7.0 - 3.6 months). Outcome measures were three global measures of clinical and functional impairment and improvement from baseline: the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scales; the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS); and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), a specific measure of PDD symptoms. Results: The mean baseline CGI-S was 5.7 - 0.8 (markedly ill/severely ill). The mean final dosage of aripiprazole was 8.1 - 4.9 mg/day. At the endpoint, 11 patients (32.4%) were â€˜much improved' or 'very much improved' (CGI-I score of 1 or 2), 12 patients (35.3%) were 'minimally improved' (CGI-I score of 3) and 10 (29.4%) were 'unchanged' or 'worsened' (CGI-I score of 4 or 5). C-GAS and CARS scores significantly improved (p < 0.0001, effect sizes 0.59 and 0.62, respectively). Nine patients (26.5%) experienced moderate to severe agitation, which was associated with self-injurious behaviours in five of these patients, and five patients presented with sleep disorders. Twelve patients (35.3%) discontinued medication during the follow-up because of lack of efficacy or adverse effects. Conclusions: In these severely impaired children with PDDs, aripiprazole monotherapy was associated with a significant improvement in maladaptive behaviours in one-third of patients. Agitation and insomnia were the most frequent adverse effects. Further controlled studies in larger samples to explore possible predictors of efficacy are warranted.

A high rate of problems was reported, with 53 % of children having 4 or more types of problems frequently. Sleep, toileting and eating problems, hyperactivity, self injury and sensory difficulties were greater in children with lower language level and in special schooling. However, anxiety, tantrums and aggression towards others were frequent regardless of age, ability or schooling. The frequency of co-existing conditions, including such emotional and behavioural problems, in children with ASD has implications for designing appropriate support services for children and families.

Ms. K had been diagnosed with schizophrenia the previous year. She had been hospitalized on three prior occasions, twice with psychosis and once for a suicide attempt in the context of psychosis and depressed mood. Following her third hospitalization, she was stabilized on aripiprazole and olanzapine. Nine months prior to her presentation, she discontinued her medications. Initially well, her functioning began to decline 3 weeks prior to her arrival to our hospital. She was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit. Given the complexity of her speech and the hope that changes might be used to monitor treatment response, permission was obtained to make audio recordings. Over the next several days, the dose of lorazepam was increased to 3 mg four times a day (QID) until her speech normalized and posturing resolved. There was no evidence of sedation. One week later, her mood had mostly stabilized and she denied hallucinations.

891,Do depressive symptoms explain associations between binge eating symptoms and later psychosocial adjustment in young adulthood?,"Prospective associations between binge eating symptoms (i.e., objective overeating [OOE] and loss of control [LOC] eating) and psychosocial functioning during emerging adulthood were examined using data from the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We examined associations between OOE and LOC eating and psychosocial functioning variables with and without adjusting for concurrent depressive symptoms. Analyses revealed that OOE at Wave 3 (ages 18â€“28) was associated with depressive symptoms, social isolation, weight perception, and perceived attractiveness seven years later at Wave 4 (ages 25â€“35) and LOC eating at Wave 3 was associated with later depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts, weight perception, social isolation, number of close friends, and sleep difficulty. Analyses adjusted for depressive symptoms at Wave 3 revealed that OOE at Wave 3 was associated with social isolation and perceived attractiveness at Wave 4 and LOC eating at Wave 3 was associated with later depressive symptoms, isolation, number of close friends, and sleep difficulty. Results show that binge eating symptoms are prospectively associated with psychosocial impairment during emerging adulthood even after controlling for depressive symptoms. Rather than simply screening for depressive symptoms, results highlight the utility of screening for binge eating symptoms as these symptoms are independently associated with psychosocial impairment in emerging adults.

892,Associations between sleep habits and mental health status and suicidality in a longitudinal survey of monozygotic twin adolescents,"Several epidemiological studies have indicated that there is a relationship between sleep habits, such as sleep duration, bedtime and bedtime regularity, and mental health status, including depression and anxiety in adolescents. However, it is still to be clarified whether the relationship is direct causeâ€andâ€effect or mediated by the influence of genetic and other traits, i.e. quasiâ€correlation. To examine this issue, we conducted a twin study using a total of 314 data for monozygotic twins from a longitudinal survey of sleep habits and mental health status conducted in a unified junior and senior high school (grades 7-12), located in Tokyo, Japan. Threeâ€level hierarchical linear model analysis showed that both bedtime and sleep duration had significant associations with the Japanese version of the 12â€item General Health Questionnaire (GHQâ€12) score, suicidal thoughts and the experience of selfâ€harm behaviours when genetic factors and shared environmental factors, which were completely shared between coâ€twins, were controlled for. These associations were statistically significant even after controlling for bedtime regularity, which was also associated significantly with the GHQâ€12 score. These suggest that the associations between sleep habits and mental health status were still statistically significant after controlling for the influence of genetic and shared environmental factors of twins, and that there may be a direct causeâ€andâ€effect in the relationship in adolescents. Thus, late bedtime and short sleep duration could predict subsequent development of depression and anxiety, including suicidal or selfâ€injury risk. This suggests that poor mental health status in adolescents might be improved by health education and intervention concerning sleep and lifestyle habits.

893,Differentiating depressed adolescent 24 h cortisol secretion in light of their adult clinical outcome,"A clinical follow-up study was performed of adolescent major depressives and normal control subjects approximately 10 years after the subjects had undergone serial cortisol measurements over a 24-h period. In light of their young adulthood clinical status, our objective was to ascertain whether there were any premorbid cortisol abnormalities associated with depressive course of illness. In all, 77 young adults who had received a diagnosis of adolescent major depressive disorder, or were determined to be normal volunteers free of psychiatric diagnosis at index period and during follow-up, were studied. When subjects were adolescents, blood samples were collected for cortisol at 20-min intervals during the 24-h period coinciding with the third consecutive night of sleep EEG. The subjects, in young adulthood at the time of follow-up, were reinterviewed regarding longitudinal course of illness, and the original adolescent cortisol data were analyzed in the light of information obtained. Of the subjects who had experienced at least one lifetime major depressive episode during the follow-up period, the subgroup who would go on to make suicide attempts during the follow-up period secreted significantly greater levels of cortisol in the 4, 6, and 12 h prior to sleep onset. Conversely, this same subgroup exhibited reduced cortisol levels 2-4 h following sleep onset. Adolescents who are at risk to make suicide attempts appear to display significant elevations of cortisol prior to sleep onset, a time when the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is normally most quiescent. Dysregulation of the HPA axis, combined with dysfunction of sleep-onset mechanisms previously reported in this same cohort, might serve as premorbid biological substrates that predict suicide attempts during follow-up.;Depressive Disorder, Major/*blood, Hydrocortisone/*blood, Adolescent, Adult, Aging, Case-Control Studies, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Electroencephalography/methods, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), Sleep Stages, Suicide, Attempted/psychology, Time Factors","Mathew, Sanjay J; Coplan, Jeremy D; Goetz, Raymond R; Feder, Adriana; Greenwald, Steven; Dahl, Ronald E; Ryan, Neal D; Mann, J John & Weissman, Myrna M",1,893
894,Effects of symptoms of comorbid psychopathology on challenging behaviors among atypically developing infants and toddlers as assessed with the Baby and Infant Screen for Children with Autism Traits (BISCUIT),"Comorbid psychopathology and challenging behaviors often occur among persons with developmental disabilities. However, little attention to this issue has been reported in young children. In this study, individuals 17 through 36 months of age with varying diagnoses, such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and Down syndrome, among others, were evaluated. Greater levels of symptoms of comorbid psychopathology were related to higher rates of challenging behaviors. Additionally, Inattention/Impulsivity, Avoidant Behavior, Anxiety/Repetitive Behaviors, and Tantrum/Conduct Problems were significantly related to high rates of Aggressive and Destructive Behaviors, Stereotypies, and Self-Injurious Behavior. Also, those who displayed greater levels of Eating/Sleep Problems engaged in more Aggressive and Destructive Behaviors and Stereotypies but not Self-Injurious Behavior. Thus, even at young ages, children with atypical development without an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis are at high risk for a variety of problem behaviors and disorders that may be related to one another.

895,Suicide in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a clinical analysis of seven suicidal patients,"Despite many suicidal cases in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), literature on this subject is lacking. To elucidate and prevent this phenomenon, we re-evaluated the clinical records of seven suicidal patients with SLE. Six patients had photosensitivity and insomnia. At the time of the suicide attempt, hypocomplementemia was observed in five of six patients. Diffuse slowing on electroencephalograms were observed in four of five patients. One patient successfully committed suicide while on no therapy while five patients made their attempts under the tapering courses of steroids. Five patients manifested psychoses whereas two patients displayed no psychotic findings. All patients attempted suicide shortly after admission (mean time 20 days). The subsequent courses of the survivors who received more medication were favorable. Therefore, it appears that disease activity was not fully controlled in these patients. Furthermore, signs of an imminent suicide attempt were missed in some cases. Psychosis, insomnia, history of photosensitivity, an incompletely controlled disease state, receiving tapering steroid dose, diffuse slowings on electroencephalograms and the presence of hypocomplementemia appeared to be risks for attempting suicide in SLE. We would recommend that such patients be under psychiatric care for at least 2 months to prevent suicide. When the patient is still psychotic or unstable, further medical care will be required.;Suicide*/prevention & control, Suicide*/psychology, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Complement Hemolytic Activity Assay, Electroencephalography, Female, Hospitalization, Humans, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/physiopathology, Middle Aged, Suicide, Attempted/psychology","Matsukawa, Y; Sawada, S; Hayama, T; Usui, H & Horie, T",0,895
896,Current situation and clinical characteristics of sedative-related disorder patients in Japan: Comparison with methamphetamine-related disorder patients,"The purpose of the present study is to examine the current situation of sedative-related disorders (mainly benzodiazepines) in Japan and the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with this disorder. Subjects were 671 drug-related disorder patients diagnosed according to the ICD-10 classification as â€œF1: mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use,â€ who abused psychoactive substances other than alcohol. Of all the psychiatric hospitals in Japan between September and October 2010, these drug-related disorder patients had consecutively consulted or were admitted to 153 psychiatric hospitals. The present study was conducted by means of a mail survey. Subjectsâ€™ clinical information, including history of psychoactive substance use, means of access to the primary drug of abuse, other ICD-10 diagnoses including F1 subcategory and comorbid psychiatric disorders, and recent history of self-destructive behavior, were collected from the attending psychiatrists of each subject. The data thus gathered concerning sedative-related disorder patients were compared with those patients with methamphetamine-related disorder, which has been the most serious drug-related problem in Japan since the 1950s. Out of the 671 subjects, 119 patients mainly abusing sedatives (the SRD group) were identified, while 361 patients were identified as mainly abusing methamphetamine (the MRD group). The MRD group was the largest population (53.8% of the total subjects), followed by the SRD group (17.7%), the inhalant-related disorder group with 56 patients (8.3%), and so on. Compared with the MRD group, the SRD group was younger, contained more female patients, and had a lower incidence of history of involvement with anti-social societies and anti-social behavior. Patients of the SRD group were more likely to have started abusing drugs with the intention of reducing the unpleasant symptoms of insomnia (42.9%), anxiety (26.1%), and depression (16.0%), and to acquire the drugs they abused from medical institutions such as psychiatric or primary care clinics (82.1%), while patients of the MRD group were more likely to have started out of curiosity (35.1%) or in response to peer pressure (47.1%), and to acquire their drugs from a â€œpusherâ€ (32.8%). Additionally, in the SRD group, the ICD-10 F1 subcategory diagnoses that were clinically most important were â€œdependence syndromeâ€ (64.0%), â€œharmful useâ€ (16.2%) and â€œacute intoxicationâ€ (16.2%), while the most important subcategory diagnosis in the MRD group was â€œpsychotic disorderâ€ (34.3%) and â€œresidual disorder and late-onset psychotic disorderâ€ (32.9%). Further, comorbid psychiatric disorders were more frequently found in the SRD group than in the MRD group; notably, co-occurrence of mood disorder was found in 45.0% of the SRD group in contrast to the MRD group (11.9%). Recent episodes of deliberate self-harm behavior were also more frequently found in the SRD group than the MRD group (33.6% vs. 10.5%); the major means by which these patients harmed themselves was by overdosing on prescribed drugs (23.5% vs. 4.7%). The present study suggests that sedative-related disorder is an important clinical issue in the field of drugrelated disorders in Japan today, and that SRD patients may represent a distinct type of drug abusers whose clinical characteristics are different from those of MRD patients. The development and spread of treatment programs for â€œdependence syndromeâ€ and â€œharmful useâ€ will help SRD patients, and educating psychiatrists about SRD will help prevent future sedative abuse.

897,Day workers suffering from a wider range of sleep problems are more likely to experience suicidality,"Both a higher suicide rate and widespread sleep problems are serious health concerns in Japan when compared with those of other countries. We investigated the relationship between suicidal ideation and sleep problems in Japanese day workers using the 3-dimensional sleep scale (3DSS), which measures three sleep elements (phase, quality, and quantity). Data from 635 Japanese day workers (461 mens and 174 womens) were included. The 3DSS was used to assess participants' sleep condition. Participants were classified into eight sleep types based on scores of phase, quality, and quantity: All Good Sleep, Owl (poor phase), Inefficient (poor quality), Short (poor quantity), OwlÂ +Â Inefficient (poor phase and quality), OwlÂ +Â Short (poor phase and quantity), InefficientÂ +Â Short (poor quality and quantity), and All Poor Sleep. We assessed participants' suicidal ideation using question 19 of the self-rating depression scale (SDS); 119 cases (18.7Â %) had ratings of 2-4 for this question and were considered to have suicidal ideation. The higher the number of sleep problems, the higher the risk of suicidal ideation compared to sleep types not indicative of problems. All Poor Sleep had the highest risk of the eight sleep types. Individuals with OwlÂ +Â Short, InefficientÂ +Â Short, or All Poor Sleep had a significant risk of suicidal ideation even after adjusting for hopelessness and nightmares. Our findings suggested that sleep problems assessed by the 3DSS were related to suicidal ideation.

898,"Depression With Atypical Features in the National Comorbidity Survey: Classification, Description, and Consequences","Examines the diagnosis of atypical depression using only the reversed vegetative symptoms of hypersomnia and hyperphagia. An atypical depression group (n=304) was identified within the US National Comorbidity Survey, which assessed psychiatric disorders among using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The atypical group was identified based on DSM-III-R criteria for a major depressive episode, in addition to atypical features of hypersomnia and hyperphagia. Comparison groups were those with nonatypical depression (n=532) and individuals without a psychiatric disorder (n=4,071). Compared with nonatypical depression, atypical depression was associated with a greater percentage of women and an earlier age of onset. The atypical group also reported higher rates of most depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and attempts, psychiatric comorbidity (panic disorder, social phobia, and drug dependence), disability and restricted activity days, use of some health care services, paternal depression, and childhood neglect and sexual abuse. Compared with people without psychiatric disorders, the atypical group reported higher rates of disability and restricted activity days, use of all mental health care services, parental depression, and childhood abuse.

899,Considering benefits and harms of duloxetine for treatment of stress urinary incontinence: a meta-analysis of clinical study reports,"Background: The European Medicines Agency makes clinical study reports publicly available and publishes reasons for not approving applications for marketing authorization. Duloxetine has been approved in Europe for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women. The reported adverse effects of duloxetine include mental health problems and suicidality. We obtained clinical study reports from the European Medicines Agency concerning use of this drug for stress urinary incontinence.; Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 4 randomized placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine (involving a total of 1913 patients) submitted to the European Medicines Agency for marketing approval for the indication of stress urinary incontinence in women. We used data from the clinical study reports (totalling 6870 pages and including individual patient data) to assess benefits (including frequency of incontinence and changes in quality-of-life scores, such as Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating) and harms (both general harms, including discontinuation because of adverse events, and harms related to suicidality, violent behaviour and their potential precursors, such as akathisia and activation [stimulating effects such as insomnia, anxiety and agitation]).; Results: Duloxetine was significantly better than placebo in terms of percentage change in weekly incontinence episodes (mean difference -13.56%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -21.59% to -5.53%) and change in Incontinence Quality of Life total score (mean difference 3.24, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.48). However, the effect sizes were small, and a sensitivity analysis (with removal of one trial) showed that the number needed to treat for a Patient Global Impression of Improvement rating of much better or very much better"" was 8 (95% CI 6 to 13). The numbers needed to harm were 7 (95% CI 6 to 8) for discontinuing because of an adverse event and 7 (95% CI 6 to 9) for experiencing an activation event. No suicidality violence or akathisia events were noted.; Interpretation: Although duloxetine is effective for stress urinary incontinence in women the rates of associated harm were high when individual patient data were analyzed and the harms outweighed the benefits.; Â© 2017 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.""Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Duloxetine Hydrochloride/*therapeutic use, Urinary Incontinence, Stress/*drug therapy, Affective Symptoms/chemically induced, Akathisia, Drug-Induced/etiology, Anxiety/chemically induced, Female, Humans, Mental Disorders/chemically induced, Psychoses, Substance-Induced/etiology, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Risk Assessment, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/chemically induced, Suicidal Ideation, Treatment Outcome, Violence","Maund, Emma; Guski, Louise Schow & GÃ¸tzsche, Peter C.",0,899

The article discusses the successful treatment of resistant postpsychotic depressive symptoms with venlafaxine. Treatment with venlafaxine produced some improvement in sleep, eating, and energy. The suicidal ideation was alleviated. After 2 weeks, the dose was increased. The only side effect reported was nausea during the 1st 4 wks of treatment. Six weeks later, most depressive symptoms disappeared and did not recur during the 6-mo period after the initiation of venlafaxine treatment. Followup sessions found a continuation of gradual improvement in energy and joy of living, and no evidence of any psychotic symptoms.

However, there have been few large-scale studies addressing this issue. The current study examined the prevalence and correlates of physical aggression in a sample of 1584 children and adolescents with ASD enrolled in the Autism Treatment Network. The prevalence of aggression was 53%, with highest prevalence among young children. Aggression was significantly associated with a number of clinical features, including self-injury, sleep problems, sensory problems, GI problems, communication and social functioning. In multivariate models, self-injury, sleep problems, and sensory problems were most strongly associated with aggression. The results indicate that aggression is markedly prevalent, and clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

902,"The use of antidepressant medications in early childhood: Prevalence, efficacy, and risk","Prescription rates of psychotropic medications for young children have doubled in the past decade, and antidepressants are the second most prescribed medication in the preschool period. This trend of increased antidepressant use among very young children has occurred despite a dearth of safety and efficacy clinical trials. In fact, there has not been one published clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of antidepressant medication with children under age 5. Yet, some clinicians continue to engage in off-label prescribing practices with young children as they attempt to provide the best possible treatment while minimizing harmful adverse effects. Antidepressant medications may serve a beneficial role in attenuating the harmful consequences of long-term stress on neurodevelopment, but this must be considered against potential adverse effects including activation of mania, agitation, irritability, gastrointestinal symptoms, eating and sleep disturbances, growth retardation and increased suicidal ideation. High-quality research trials are needed to examine the efficacy and safety of antidepressant medication therapy with young children, including the short- and long-term outcomes. Until then, clinicians are advised to avoid antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment, and instead use more proven methods such as play therapy, psychotherapy, and parent training.

904,Nightmares and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep mediate the effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation,"Study Objectives: Many studies have reported a positive association between sleep problems and suicidal ideation. Some prospective studies in the elderly have shown that insomnia is a risk factor for suicide death after controlling for other depressive symptoms. However, hypotheses to explain how this risk is mediated have not previously been assessed. We tested the hypothesis that insomnia symptoms are related to suicidal ideation through mediation by dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep and/or nightmares.; Methods: We measured symptoms of depression, hopelessness, insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, nightmares, and suicidal ideation intensity on a convenience sample of 50 patients with depressive disorders, including 23 outpatients, 16 inpatients, and 11 suicidal ED patients. Mediation analysis was used to assess the indirect effects of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation through dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and through nightmares.; Results: Our findings again confirmed a positive association between insomnia symptoms and the intensity of suicidal ideas in depressed patients (b = 0.64, 95% CI = [0.14, 1.15]). However, we extended and clarified our earlier findings by now showing that dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep as well as nightmares may mediate the association between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation. The indirect effects of insomnia symptoms through dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and through nightmares were 0.38 (-0.03, 0.97) and 0.35 (0.05, 0.75), respectively.; Conclusions: Nightmares as well as dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep each are positively and independently related to the intensity of suicidal ideation, and the effect of insomnia symptoms appears to be mediated through these two variables.;Suicidal Ideation*, Depressive Disorder/*epidemiology, Dreams/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*epidemiology, Adult, Age Distribution, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Comorbidity, Confidence Intervals, Cross-Sectional Studies, Databases, Factual, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data, Female, Humans, Incidence, Inpatients/statistics & numerical data, Male, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Middle Aged, Outpatients/statistics & numerical data, Psychometrics, Regression Analysis, Severity of Illness Index, Sex Distribution, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, United States, Young Adult","McCall, W Vaughn; Batson, Nicholas; Webster, Megan; Case, L Douglas; Joshi, Indu; Derreberry, Todd; McDonough, Adam & Farris, Suzan R",1,904
905,A psychometric cut-point to separate emergently suicidal depressed patients from stable depressed outpatients,"Context: The design of safe clinical trials targeting suicidal ideation requires operational definitions of what degree of suicidal ideation is too excessive to allow safe participation.; Aims: We examined the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) to develop a psychometric cut-point that would identify patients having a suicidal emergency.; Settings and Design: The Emergency Department (ED) and the out-patient clinic of a university hospital.; Materials and Methods: We used the SSI to contrast 23 stable, depressed adult out-patients versus 11 depressed adult ED patients awaiting psychiatric admission for a suicidal emergency.; Statistical Analysis: The performance of the SSI was examined with nominal logistic regression.; Results: ED patients were older than out-patients (P<0.001), with proportionally more men (P<0.05), and were more ethnically diverse than the outpatients (P<0.005). Compared to out-patients, ED patients were more depressed (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score 23.1Â±3.8 vs. 11.7Â±7.3, P<0.005) and reported a greater degree of suicidal ideation (SSI scores 25.7Â±7.3 vs. 4.2Â±8.4, P<0.0001). Nominal logistic regression for the univariate model of SSI score and group yielded a score of 16 (P<0.0001) as the best cut-point in separating groups, with a corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve = 0.94. Of 34 patients in the total sample, only two were misclassified by SSI score = 16, with both of these being false positive for ED status. Thus, the sensitivity of the cut-point was 100% with specificity of 91%. When the model was expanded to include SSI along with age, gender, ethnicity, sedative-hypnotic use, and over-the-counter use, only SSI score remained significant as a predictor.; Conclusions: A SSI score â‰¥16 may be useful as an exclusion criterion for out-patients in depression clinical trials.; Depression, emergency department, suicidal ideation","McCall, W.

906,What if?,"This editorial discusses the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) by discussing the case of Robin Williams. Williams was found dead in his California home. The autopsy reportedly did not find alcohol or illegal drugs, but prescription drugs were found in expected concentrations. There was no mention of whether a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia had been made while he was living. Aging white men with both depressive symptoms and medical illness are at increased risk for suicide. Parkinson's disease, and perhaps Lewy body dementia with Parkinson's disease symptoms, has a robust association with depression. Treatment of Parkinson's disease with dopamine agonists can be associated with severe neuropsychological symptoms. ECT is a potent antidepressant treatment and has a beneficial effect on sleep and Parkinson's disease. ECT is associated with a reduction in suicidal ideation. If Robin Williams had been offered and received ECT, it would have made some difference.

The report by BjÃ¸rngaard et al. represents an additional advance in the insomnia suicide story. This paper describes an effort to survey all the residents of a single county in Norway between 1984 and 1986 who were >20 years old, including self-report measurements of sleep problems and depression/anxiety symptoms. The authors succeeded in capturing >85% of the residents of the county,and then used death registries to ascertain suicide over the ensuing 20 years. Positive associations were shown between sleep problem frequency and suicide death, even after adjusting for depression and anxiety symptoms. While the study by BjÃ¸rngaard et al. largely confirms what has been reported by others, additional findings of their present study offer a few new twists. Completion of this research agenda would move insomnia alongside OSA as a sleep disorder with a strong association with excess mortality, a plausible mediating mechanism, and an intervention strategy that is proven to reduce mortality, or at least reduce risk through surrogate variables for suicide death.

908,"Hypnotic medications and suicide: Risk, mechanisms, mitigation, and the FDA","Objective: Insomnia is associated with increased risk for suicide. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated that warnings regarding suicide be included in the prescribing information for hypnotic medications. The authors conducted a review of the evidence for and against the claim that hypnotics increase the risk of suicide. Method: This review focused on modern, FDA-approved hypnotics, beginning with the introduction of benzodiazepines, limiting its findings to adults. PubMed and Web of Science were searched, crossing the terms 'suicide' and 'suicidal' with each of the modern FDA-approved hypnotics. The FDA web site was searched for postmarketing safety reviews, and the FDA was contacted with requests to provide detailed case reports for hypnotic-related suicide deaths reported through its Adverse Event Reporting System. Results: Epidemiological studies show that hypnotics are associated with an increased risk for suicide. However, none of these studies adequately controlled for depression or other psychiatric disorders that may be linked with insomnia. Suicide deaths have been reported from single-agent hypnotic overdoses. A separate concern is that benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics can cause parasomnias, which in rare cases may lead to suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in persons who were not known to be suicidal. On the other hand, ongoing research is testing whether treatment of insomnia may reduce suicidality in adults with depression. Conclusions: The review findings indicate that hypnotic medications are associated with suicidal ideation. Future studies should be designed to assess whether increases in suicidality result from CNS impairments from a given hypnotic medication or whether such medication decreases suicidality because of improvements in insomnia.

909,Insomnia severity is an indicator of suicidal ideation during a depression clinical trial,"Objective: Insomnia has been linked to suicidal ideas and suicide death in cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies. A link between insomnia and suicide has not been previously examined in the setting of a clinical trial. Herein we describe the relationship between insomnia and suicidal thinking during the course of a clinical trial for depression with insomnia. Methods: Sixty patients aged 41.5 Â± 12.5 years (2/3 women) with major depressive episode and symptoms of insomnia received open-label fluoxetine for 9 weeks and also received blinded, randomized eszopiclone 3 mg or placebo at bedtime after the first week of fluoxetine. Insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and suicidal ideation was assessed with The Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI). Depression symptoms were assessed with the depressed mood item and the anhedonia item from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-24 (HRSD24), as well as a sum score for all non-sleep and non-suicide items from the HRSD (HRSD20). Measurements were taken at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. SSI was examined by generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures as the outcome of interest for all 60 participants with ISI and various mood symptoms as independent variables, with adjustment for age, gender, treatment assignment, and baseline SSI. Results: Higher levels of insomnia corresponded to significantly greater intensity of suicidal thinking (p < 0.01). The depressed mood item of the HRSD, and the sum of the HRSD20, both corresponded to greater suicidal thinking (p < 0.001). The anhedonia item did not correspond with suicidal thinking. When both ISI and the depressed mood item, or ISI and the anhedonia item, were included together in the same model, the ISI remained an independent predictor of suicidal thinking. Conclusions: The results support the concept that insomnia may be a useful indicator for suicidal ideation and now extend this idea into clinical trials. Insomnia remains an independent indicator of suicidal ideation, even taking into account the core symptoms of depression such as depressed mood and anhedonia. The complaint of insomnia during a depression clinical trial might indicate that more direct questioning about suicide is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

910,A multi-site randomized clinical trial to reduce suicidal ideation in suicidal adult outpatients with Major Depressive Disorder: Development of a methodology to enhance safety,"Background/aims: Suicide is a major public health concern, yet there are very few randomized clinical trials that have been conducted to reduce suicidal ideation in patients at risk of suicide. We describe the rationale and refinements of such a trial that is designed to assess the effect of a hypnotic medication on suicidal ideation in adult outpatients currently experiencing suicidal ideation.; Methods: Reducing Suicidal Ideation Through Insomnia Treatment"" is a multi-site randomized clinical trial that includes three recruiting sites and one data management site. This 4-year study is in its second year of recruitment. The purpose of the study is to compare hypnotic medication versus placebo as an add-on treatment to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as a means of reducing suicidal ideation in depressed adult outpatients with insomnia and suicidal ideation. The safety features of the study follow the 2001 National Institutes of Health guidelines for studies that include patients at risk of suicide.; Results: In total 584 potential participants have undergone telephone screening; 67% of these failed the phone screen most often due to an absence of expressed suicidal ideation (26% of the telephone screen fails). A total of 115 people appeared for a face-to-face baseline assessment and 40 of these had completed a taper off of their ineffective psychotropic medications before the baseline assessments. In all 64% of those who completed baseline assessments failed to proceed to randomization most commonly because of no clinically significant suicidal ideation (51% of those excluded at baseline). One participant was offered and accepted voluntary psychiatric hospitalization in lieu of study participation. Thus far 40 participants have been randomized into the study and 88.7% of scheduled visits have been attended with 93.8% adherence to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 91.6% adherence to the randomized hypnotic versus placebo. None of the randomized participants have required hospitalization or had a suicide attempt.; Conclusion: By carefully considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and other safety features the safe conduct of randomized clinical trials in suicidal adult patients is possible including the inclusion of participants who have undergone a prescribed tapering off of psychotropic medications prior to baseline assessment.; Â© The Author(s) 2015.""Accession Number: 25733676.

911,"A pilot, randomized clinical trial of bedtime doses of prazosin versus placebo in suicidal posttraumatic stress disorder patients with nightmares","Purpose/Background: Observational studies show an association between nightmares and suicide. Prazosin is proposed as a nightmare treatment. This pilot, randomized clinical trial tested whether treatment of nightmares with prazosin would reduce suicidal ideas in suicidal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients. Methods/Procedures: Twenty adult, suicidal PTSD patients with nightmares were blindly and randomly assigned 1:1 to escalating doses of prazosin versus placebo at bedtime only for 8 weeks. All participants had comorbid mood disorders and received stable doses of mood disorder medication. Outcomes of interest were measured weekly and included severity of suicidal ideation, nightmares, PTSD, insomnia, and depression. Longitudinal mixed-effects models assessed change in outcomes over time. Findings/Results: All psychometric measures improved over 8 weeks. However, nighttime measures of nightmares and insomnia showed significantly less improvement in the prazosin group, whereas there was no significant change in daytime measures of suicidal ideation and daytime-only PTSD symptoms. Two patients required emergency psychiatric hospitalization, but there were no suicide attempts and no deaths. Implications/Conclusions: This study confirmed an effect of nighttime-only prazosin on nighttime symptoms of insomnia and nightmares in suicidal PTSD patients who are experiencing nightmares. Surprisingly, the effect was in the direction opposite of what we expected. Furthermore, prazosin showed no signal on daytime measures including suicidal ideation. The results do not support a larger study of nighttime-only prazosin in suicidal PTSD patients but leave open the possibility of benefit from daytime administration of prazosin.

912,Genetic and clinical factors predict lithium's effects on PER2 gene expression rhythms in cells from bipolar disorder patients,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with abnormal circadian rhythms. In treatment responsive BD patients, lithium (Li) stabilizes mood and reduces suicide risk. Li also affects circadian rhythms and expression of 'clock genes' that control them. However, the extent to which BD, Li and the circadian clock share common biological mechanisms is unknown, and there have been few direct measurements of clock gene function in samples from BD patients. Hence, the role of clock genes in BD and Li treatment remains unclear. Skin fibroblasts from BD patients (N=19) or healthy controls (N=19) were transduced with Per2::luc, a rhythmically expressed, bioluminescent circadian clock reporter gene, and rhythms were measured for 5 consecutive days. Rhythm amplitude and period were compared between BD cases and controls with and without Li. Baseline period was longer in BD cases than in controls. Li 1 mM increased amplitude in controls by 36%, but failed to do so in BD cases. Li 10 mM lengthened period in both BD cases and controls. Analysis of clock gene variants revealed that PER3 and RORA genotype predicted period lengthening by Li, whereas GSK3Î² genotype predicted rhythm effects of Li, specifically among BD cases. Analysis of BD cases by clinical history revealed that cells from past suicide attempters were more likely to show period lengthening with Li 1 mM. Finally, Li enhanced the resynchronization of damped rhythms, suggesting a mechanism by which Li could act therapeutically in BD. Our work suggests that the circadian clock's response to Li may be relevant to molecular pathology of BD.;Antimanic Agents/*pharmacology, Bipolar Disorder/*genetics, Circadian Rhythm/*genetics, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*genetics, Lithium Compounds/*pharmacology, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1/*genetics, Period Circadian Proteins/*drug effects, Period Circadian Proteins/*genetics, Adult, Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy, Bipolar Disorder/metabolism, Case-Control Studies, Cells, Cultured, Female, Fibroblasts/drug effects, Fibroblasts/metabolism, Gene Expression/drug effects, Humans, Lithium Compounds/therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Period Circadian Proteins/metabolism, Young Adult","McCarthy, M J; Wei, H; Marnoy, Z; Darvish, R M; McPhie, D L; Cohen, B M & Welsh, D K",0,912
913,Residual symptoms in depressed outpatients who respond by 50% but do not remit to antidepressant medication,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 33(6) of Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology (see record [rid]2013-42776-025[/rid]). In the original article, there was an error in one of the sentences on page 181 in the Materials and Methods Section, Assessment Measures subsection. The corrected sentence is present in the erratum.] Little is known about the quantity or quality of residual depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have responded but not remitted with antidepressant treatment. This report describes the residual symptom domains and individual depressive symptoms in a large representative sample of outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD who responded without remitting after up to 12 weeks of citalopram treatment in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. Response was defined as 50% or greater reduction in baseline 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology--Self-Report (QIDS-SRâ‚â‚†) by treatment exit, and remission as a final QIDS-SRâ‚â‚† of less than 6. Residual symptom domains and individual symptoms were based on the QIDS-SRâ‚â‚† and classified as either persisting from baseline or emerging during treatment. Most responders who did not remit endorsed approximately 5 residual symptom domains and 6 to 7 residual depressive symptoms. The most common domains were insomnia (94.6%), sad mood (70.8%), and decreased concentration (69.6%). The most common individual symptoms were midnocturnal insomnia (79.0%), sad mood (70.8%), and decreased concentration/decision making (69.6%). The most common treatment-emergent symptoms were midnocturnal insomnia (51.4%) and decreased general interest (40.0%). The most common persistent symptoms were midnocturnal insomnia (81.6%), sad mood (70.8%), and decreased concentration/decision making (70.6%). Suicidal ideation was the least common treatment-emergent symptom (0.7%) and the least common persistent residual symptom (17.1%). These findings suggest that depressed outpatients who respond by 50% without remitting to citalopram treatment have a broad range of residual symptoms. Individualized treatments are warranted to specifically address each patient's residual depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

914,Relationship between alcohol use disorders and suicidality in a psychiatric population: in-patient prevalence study,"Background: Alcohol misuse is a risk factor in suicide and parasuicide.; Aims: To measure the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in a cohort of psychiatric admissions using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the relationship between the AUDIT score and suicidality.; Method: Consecutive psychiatric admissions were interviewed with a lifestyle survey that included the AUDIT, and admission case notes were reviewed.; Results: Out of 200 subjects, 48.5% scored 8 or more (indicating hazardous or harmful alcohol use) and 22.5% scored 16 or more (indicating significant alcohol dependence) on the AUDIT. There were no significant gender differences. Alcohol misuse was strongly associated with suicidality.; Conclusions: The AUDIT questionnaire should be incorporated into psychiatric assessments when risk of self-harm is being evaluated. Further research is warranted to examine the impact of interventions for alcohol use disorders in psychiatric settings on self-harm and suicidal ideation.;Alcohol-Related Disorders/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adult, Alcohol-Related Disorders/diagnosis, Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry), Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Patient Admission, Psychometrics, Risk Factors, Self-Injurious Behavior/psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology, Smoking/psychology, Substance-Related Disorders/psychology, Surveys and Questionnaires","McCloud, Annie; Barnaby, Ben; Omu, Nicola; Drummond, Colin & Aboud, Andy",1,914
915,Prevalence of suicidal ideation and other suicide warning signs in veterans attending an urgent care psychiatric clinic,"Background: Suicide prevention in the clinical setting is focused on evaluating risk in the coming hours to days, yet little is known about which factors increase acute risk.; Purpose: To determine the prevalence of factors that may serve as warnings of heightened acute risk.; Methods: Veterans attending an urgent care psychiatric clinic (n=473) completed a survey on suicidal ideation and other acute risk warning signs.; Results: More than half the sample (52%) reported suicidal ideation during the prior week. Of these, more than one-third (37%) had active ideation which included participants with a current suicide plan (27%) and those who had made preparations to carry out their plan (12%). Other warning signs were also highly prevalent, with the most common being: sleep disturbances (89%), intense anxiety (76%), intense agitation (75%), hopelessness (70%), and desperation (70%). Almost all participants (97%) endorsed at least one warning sign. Participants with depressive syndrome and/or who screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder endorsed the largest number of warning signs. Those with both depressive syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder were more likely to endorse intense affective states than those with either disorder alone. All p-values for group comparisons are <.008.; Conclusion: Our major findings are the strikingly high prevalence of past suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, current suicidal ideation and intense affective states in veterans attending an urgent care psychiatric clinic; and the strong associations between co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive syndrome with intense affective states.; Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

916,An open study of the effects of sertraline on adolescent major depression,"This open study investigated the effects of sertraline in treating 13 adolescents, ages 12 to 18, who were hospitalized for treatment of a major depressive episode. The sample included 7 adolescents with nonendogenous depression and 6 with endogenous depression, as diagnosed by both Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Kiddie-SADS-P DSM-III-R endogenous subtype criteria. These patients were followed for an inpatient length of stay ranging from 9 to 38 days (mean 19 days), with later outpatient follow-up for a total of 12 weeks. Measures of depression were found to improve significantly, including suicidal ideation and most of the DSM-III-R symptoms of major depression. Sertraline (mean 110 mg or 1.96 mg/kg daily) significantly decreased scores on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale from premedication baseline to treatment week 12, and also between weeks 1 (after a large week 1 improvement, presumably due to nondrug effects) and 12. There was a small but significant improvement on the Children's Global Assessment Scale between baseline and week 12, but the Family Global Assessment Scale showed no significant change; neither global assessment scale showed significant effects between weeks 1 and 12. Sleep disturbance was common (69%) after 12 weeks of treatment, but clinically significant improvements in sleep patterns were also observed. This open-label prospective study suggests that sertraline might be useful in treating adolescents with major depression. Adverse effects, mainly insomnia and drowsiness, were relatively common but usually manageable. One patient developed mania after 8 days of sertraline treatment at a dose of 100 mg daily.;1-Naphthylamine/*analogs & derivatives, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, 1-Naphthylamine/therapeutic use, Adolescent, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sertraline","McConville, B J; Minnery, K L; Sorter, M T; West, S A; Friedman, L M & Christian, K",0,916
917,Do behavior changes herald physical illness in adults with mental retardation?,"A longitudinal study of 62 individuals with profound mental retardation was conducted to determine if direct care staff can identify behavior change prior to identifying symptoms of acute illness. Results indicate that staff were able to notice changes in sluggishness prior to the onset of illness. Self-care behavior was of borderline significance and there was no significant change in eight behavior dimensions (vocalizations, peer conflict, stereotypy, aggression, self injurious behavior, restlessness, distractibility, and depression). This finding should alert physicians and caregivers to the importance of prompt response to symptoms. Reliance on behavioral observation of direct care staff is not always sensitive enough to pick up changes in health status in less restrictive residential environments.;Sick Role*, Intellectual Disability/*psychology, Activities of Daily Living/psychology, Adult, Female, Health Status Indicators, Humans, Intellectual Disability/diagnosis, Intermediate Care Facilities, Male, Patient Care Team, Prospective Studies, Self Care/psychology, Sleep Stages, Social Behavior","McDermott, S; Breen, R; Platt, T; Dhar, D; Shelton, J & Krishnaswami, S",0,917
918,"Sleep problems and suicide associated with mood instability in the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2007","Objective: Mood instability is common in the general population. Mood instability is a precursor to mental illness and associated with a range of negative health outcomes. Sleep disturbance appears to be closely linked with mood instability. This study assesses the association between mood instability and sleep disturbance and the link with suicidal ideation and behaviour in a general population sample in England. Method: The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2007 collected detailed information about mental health symptoms and correlates in a representative sample of adult household residents living in England (n = 7303). Mood instability was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-II. Sleep problems were defined as sleeping more than usual or less than usual during the past month. Other dependent variables included medication use and suicidal ideation and behaviour (response rate 57%). Generalized linear modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of mood instability and sleep problems. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios. All estimates were weighted. Results: The prevalence of mood instability was 14.7% (95% confidence interval [13.6%, 15.7%]). Sleep problems occurred in 69.8% (95% confidence interval: [66.6%, 73.1%]) of those with mood instability versus 37.6% (95% confidence interval: [36.2%, 39.1%]) of those without mood instability. The use of sedating and non-sedating medications did not influence the association. Sleep problems were significantly associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour even after adjusting for mood instability. Conclusion: Sleep problems are highly prevalent in the general population, particularly among those with mood instability. Sleep problems are strongly associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour. Treatments that target risk and maintenance factors that transcend diagnostic boundaries, such as therapies that target sleep disturbance, may be particularly valuable for preventing and addressing complications related to mood instability such as suicide.

919,"Adjunctive lisdexamfetamine in bipolar depression: A preliminary randomized, placebo-controlled trial","This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) in the treatment of bipolar depression. Twenty-five outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder and syndromal depression despite at least 4 weeks of stable mood stabilizer and/or antipsychotic therapy were randomized to receive LDX (N = 11) or placebo (N = 14) in an 8-week, prospective, parallel-group, double-blind study. In the primary longitudinal analysis, LDX and placebo produced similar rates of improvement in depressive symptoms as assessed by the Montgomeryâ€“Asberg Depression Scale. However, LDX was associated with a statistically significantly greater rate of improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms and daytime sleepiness, and with greater reductions in fasting levels of low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. In the secondary baseline-to-endpoint analysis, LDX was associated with statistically significant improvements in self-reported measures of depression, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and binge eating, as well as with improvements in fasting levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. LDX was well tolerated and was not associated with any serious adverse events, but there was one case of suspected misuse. The small sample size (because of premature study termination by the funding sponsor) may have limited the detection of important drugâ€“placebo differences. Larger studies on the use of psychostimulants for treatment of bipolar depression seem warranted.

920,"Behaviors of children who are exposed and not exposed to intimate partner violence: an analysis of 330 black, white, and Hispanic children","Objective: To compare the behaviors of black, white, and Hispanic children who were 18 months to 18 years of age and exposed to intimate partner violence with an age- and ethnically similar sample of children who were not exposed to violence and to compare both exposed and nonexposed children to normative samples.; Methods: As part of a study on treatments for abused women in primary care public health clinics and Women, Infants and Children clinics in a large urban area, 258 abused mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) on 1 of their randomly selected children between the ages of 18 months and 18 years. An ethnically similar sample of 72 nonabused mothers also completed the CBCL. The CBCL is a standardized instrument that provides a parental report of the extent of a child's behavioral problems and social competencies. The CBCL consists of a form for children 18 months to 5 years and a version for ages 6 to 18 years. The CBCL is orally administered to a parent, who rates the presence and frequency of certain behaviors on a 3-point scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often true). The time period is the last 6 months for the child 6 to 18 years of age and 2 months for the child 18 months to 5 years of age. Examples of behaviors for the child age 6 to 18 years include gets in many fights truancy skips school."" Examples of behaviors for the child 18 months to 5 years of age include ""cruel to animals physically attacks people and doesn't want to sleep alone."" Both forms of the CBCL consist of 2 broadband factors of behavioral problems: internalizing and externalizing with mean scale scores for national normative samples as well as clinically referred and nonreferred samples of children. Internalizing behaviors include anxiety/depression withdrawal and somatic complaints. Externalizing behaviors include attention problems aggressive behavior and rule-breaking actions. Behavior scales yield a score of total behavioral problems. Scores are summed and then converted to normalized T scores. T scores >or=60 are within the borderline/clinical referral range-higher scores represent more deviant behavior. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were used to determine whether children from abused mothers differed significantly in their internalizing behaviors externalizing behaviors and total behavior problems from children of nonabused mothers. One sample t tests were used to compare children from abused and nonabused mothers to the matched clinically referred and nonreferred normative sample. Four pair-wise comparisons were considered: 1) children from abused women to referred norm 2) children from abused women to nonreferred norm 3) children from nonabused women to referred norm and 4) children from nonabused to nonreferred norm. The internal external and total behavior problem T scores were dichotomized into a referral status: nonreferred = T score < 60 referred = T score >or= 60. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe the distribution of referral status among the children from the abused and nonabused women and chi(2) tests of independence were used to determine whether the groups were significantly different.; Results: No significant differences in demographic characteristics between children from the abused women and nonabused women were observed. The sample consisted of a large number of Hispanic children (68.9%) and slightly more girls (53.6%) and nearly half (45.2%) had annual household incomes <10000 dollars. Means standard deviations and results from the MANOVAs performed on internal external and total behavior problem scores between children from abused and nonabused women revealed no significant differences (F[3139] = 1.21) for children ages 18 months through 5 years. Results from the MANOVA performed for ages 6 through 18 years revealed a significant group difference (F[3183] = 3.13). Univariate tests revealed significant group differences for internalizing behavior (F[1185] = 6.81) externalizing behav = 6.81) externalizing behavior (F[1185] = 7.84) and total behavior problems (F[1185] = 9.45). Overall children of abused mothers had significantly higher internalizing (58.5 +/- 12.1) externalizing (55.5 +/- 12.4) and total behavior problems (57.6 +/- 12.3) scores than the internalizing (52.9 +/- 13.7) externalizing (49.7 +/- 10.6) and total behavior problems (51.0 +/- 13.0) scores exhibited for children of nonabused mothers. Most comparisons of children from the abused women to the referred and nonreferred norms are significant. The mean internal external and total behavior problem scores from children of abused women were significantly higher than the nonreferred norms and significantly lower than the referred norms. In contrast all comparisons for children from nonabused women were not significantly different from the nonreferred norms.; Conclusions: Children ages 6 to 18 years of abused mothers exhibit significantly more internalizing externalizing and total behavior problems than children for the same age and sex of nonabused mothers. In addition the mean internalizing behavior score for boys 6 to 11 years of age as well as girls and boys 12 to 18 years of age of abused mothers were not significantly different from the clinical referral norms. Internalizing behaviors of anxiety withdrawal and depression are consistent with suicidal risk. The association of a child's exposure to intimate partner violence and subsequent attempted and/or completed suicide demands research. Our data demonstrate that children of abused mothers have significantly more behavioral problems than the nonclinically referred norm children but also for most children display significantly fewer problems than the clinically referred children. These children of abused mothers are clearly suspended above normal and below deviant with children ages 6 to 18 being at the greatest risk. If abused mothers can be identified and treated then perhaps behavior problems of their children can be arrested and behavioral scores improved. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect recommends routine screening of all women for abuse at the time of the well-child visit and implementation of a protocol that includes a safety plan for the entire family. Clinicians can use this research information to assess for intimate partner violence during child health visits and inform abused mothers of the potential effects on their children's behavior. Early detection and treatment for intimate partner violence against women has the potential to interrupt and prevent behavioral problems for their children.;""Accession Number: 12949313.

921,An examination of DSM-IV depressive symptoms and risk for suicide completion in major depressive disorder: A psychological autopsy study,"Background: It is unclear whether certain DSM-IV depressive symptoms are more prevalent among individuals who die in the context of a major depressive episode and those who do not, whether this is associated with proximal or distal suicide risk, and whether depressive symptoms cluster to indicate suicide risk. Method: A psychological autopsy method with best informants was used to investigate DSM-IV depressive symptoms among 156 suicides who died in the context of a major depressive episode and 81 major depressive controls. Results: Suicides' depressive symptoms were more likely to include weight or appetite loss, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt as well as recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Fatigue and difficulties concentrating or indecisiveness were less prevalent among depressed suicides. These associations were independent of concomitant axis I and II psychopathology. The concomitant presence of (a) fatigue as well as impaired concentration or indecisiveness and (b) weight or appetite gain and hypersomnia was associated with decreased suicide risk. Inter-episode symptom concordance suggests that insomnia is an immediate indicator of suicide risk, while weight or appetite loss and feelings of worthlessness or guilt are not. Limitations: This study employed proxy-based interviews. Conclusions: We found that discrete DSM-IV depressive symptoms and clusters of depressive symptoms help differentiate depressed individuals who die by suicide and those who do not. Moreover, some DSM-IV depressive symptoms are associated with an immediate risk for suicide, while others may result from an etiology of depression common to suicide without directly increasing suicide risk.

922,Risk behaviors and negative health outcomes for adolescents with late bedtimes,"Late bedtimes in adolescence may be a serious risk factor for later poor health and functional outcomes. The current study sought to extend existing cross sectional data by examining whether late bedtimes in adolescence predicts poor outcomes in young adulthood. Data from wave 2 (1996) and wave 3 (2001-2002) of the nationally representative sample of US youth (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) was used to examine the longitudinal relationship between late bedtime, and several risk behaviors and negative health outcomes following 3,843 adolescents into young adulthood. At wave 2 the mean age was 16 with 52.1% female. At wave 3 the mean age was 21.8. In cross sectional analyses, late bedtime was associated with 1.5 to over 3 times greater odds of involvement in risk behaviors and negative health outcomes, including emotional distress, suicidality, criminal and violent activity, and use of cigarettes, alcohol and illicit drugs. In longitudinal analyses, late bedtime assessed at wave 2 predicted a number of serious health outcomes at wave 3, with late bedtime in adolescence associated with around 1.5 greater odds of involvement in health jeopardizing behaviors such as criminal activity, alcohol abuse, cigarette use, illicit drug use and emotional distress in young adulthood. There was also a dose effect, such that the later the bedtime in adolescence, the greater the risk of involvement in risk behaviors in young adulthood. This research suggests that late bedtime in adolescence predicts multiple serious risk behaviors and health outcomes in young adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

923,The role of sleep disturbance in suicidal and nonsuicidal selfinjurious behavior among adolescents,"The relationship between different sleep disturbances and selfâ€harm thoughts and behaviors was examined among 223 adolescents presenting to a community clinic for mood disorders and suicidal and nonsuicidal selfâ€injurious behaviors. Twoâ€thirds of the adolescents reported nightly, severe sleep complaints. Relative to adolescents without significant sleep complaints, patients with severe sleep complaints at the time of clinic entry endorsed significantly more engagement in nonsuicidal selfâ€injury. Middle insomnia and circadian reversal were both significant predictors of suicide attempts. Terminal insomnia was significantly associated with suicidal ideation.

924,"Double-blind, sham-controlled, pilot study of trigeminal nerve stimulation for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder","Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS), a minimal-risk noninvasive neuromodulation method, showed potential benefits for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in an unblinded open study. The present blinded sham-controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of TNS for ADHD and potential changes in brain spectral power using resting-state quantitative electroencephalography. Method: Sixty-two children 8 to 12 years old, with full-scale IQ of at least 85 and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–diagnosed ADHD, were randomized to 4 weeks of nightly treatment with active or sham TNS, followed by 1 week without intervention. Assessments included weekly clinician-administered ADHD Rating Scales (ADHD-RS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales and quantitative electroencephalography at baseline and week 4. Results: ADHD-RS total scores showed significant group-by-time interactions (F1,228 = 8.12, p = .005; week 4 Cohen d = 0.5). CGI-Improvement scores also favored active treatment (χ²1,168 = 8.75, p = .003; number needed to treat = 3). Resting-state quantitative electroencephalography showed increased spectral power in the right frontal and frontal midline frequency bands with active TNS. Neither group had clinically meaningful adverse events. Conclusion: This study demonstrates TNS efficacy for ADHD in a blinded sham-controlled trial, with estimated treatment effect size similar to non-stimulants. TNS is well tolerated and has minimal risk. Additional research should examine treatment response durability and potential impact on brain development with sustained use.","McGough, James J.; Sturm, Alexandra; Cowen, Jennifer; Tung, Kelly; Salgari, Giulia C.; Leuchter, Andrew F.; Cook, Ian A.; Sugar, Catherine A.; Loo, Sandra K",0,924
925,Depressed or not depressed: Untangling symptoms of depression in patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease,"Background: Assessing depression in patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease is clinically challenging because depressive symptoms are often confounded by poor somatic health. Objective: To identify symptom clusters associated with clinical depression in patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease. Method: Secondary analyses of 3 similar data sets for hospitalized patients with coronary heart disease who had diagnostic screening for depression (99 depressed, 224 not depressed) were done. Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Beck Depression Inventory. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on 11 symptom variables: anhedonia, dysphoria, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, suicidal symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of libido, psychomotor impairment, and nervous irritability. Associations between symptom clusters and presence or absence of clinical depression were estimated by using logistic regression. Results: Fatigue (69%) and sleep disturbance (55%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Guilt (25%) and suicidal symptoms (9%) were the least common. Three symptom clusters (cognitive/affective, somatic/affective, and somatic) were identified. Compared with patients without cognitive/affective symptoms, patients with the cognitive/affective symptom cluster (anhedonia, dysphoria, guilt, suicidal symptoms, nervous irritability) had an odds ratio of 1.41 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.223-1.631) for clinical depression. Conclusion: Clinicians should be alert for clinical depression in hospitalized patients with coronary heart disease who have the cognitive/affective symptom cluster.

926,Physical activity and depression symptom profiles in young men and women with major depression,"Objective: This study explored whether young adults with major depression who are physically active differ in their depression symptom profile from those physically inactive. Methods: Analyses included data from 950 (47.6%) men and 1045 women (mean [standard deviation] age = 31.5 [2.6] years) participating in a national study. Participants reported leisure physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and ambulatory activity (pedometer steps per day). Diagnosis and symptoms of major depression were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: Prevalence of major depression was 5.5% (n = 52) for men and 11.6% (n = 121) for women. Interactions between physical activity and sex were observed for depressed mood, appetite changes, vacillating thoughts, and suicidality (all, p < .050). Among those with major depression, physically active men were significantly less likely to endorse the presence of insomnia (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63-0.96), fatigue (PR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.99), and suicidality (PR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.49-0.96) compared with inactive men. Physically active women were significantly less likely to endorse hypersomnia (PR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.95), excessive/ irrational guilt (PR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.97), vacillating thoughts (PR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.95), and suicidality (PR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.20-0.89) compared with inactive women. Associations were adjusted for age, physical health, educational attainment, depression severity, and other depressive symptoms.

927,Relationships between hours of sleep and health-risk behaviors in US adolescent students,"Objective: To examine associations between insufficient sleep (<8h on average school nights) and health-risk behaviors. Methods: 2007 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey data of U.S. high school students (n=12,154) were analyzed. Associations were examined on weighted data using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Insufficient sleep on an average school night was reported by 68.9% of students. Insufficient sleep was associated with higher odds of current use of cigarettes (age-adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-1.93), marijuana (AOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.31-1.76), and alcohol (AOR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.46-1.84); current sexual activity (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25-1.59); seriously considered attempting suicide (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.60-2.16); feeling sad or hopeless (AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.43-1.84); physical fighting (AOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.24-1.60), not being physically active at least 60min â‰¥ 5 days in the past 7 days (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.29), using the computer â‰¥3h/day (AOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.80), and drinking soda/pop > 1time/day (AOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.28). Conclusion: Two-thirds of adolescent students reported insufficient sleep, which was associated with many health-risk behaviors. Greater awareness of the impact of sleep insufficiency is vital.

928,The role of body vigilance in depression symptomatology,"The aim of the present study is to examine the unique predictive ability of body vigilance in terms of both global (i.e., general depression, dysphoria) and specific (i.e., suicidality, lassitude, insomnia, appetite change, ill temper, well-being) depressive symptoms in a sample of undergraduates (n = 452; 72.3% female; Mage = 19.06, SD = 2.50). Results indicated that, after controlling for the effects of the presence of medical problems, trait anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity, body vigilance was a significant predictor of greater symptoms of general depression, dysphoria, lassitude, and appetite loss. Body vigilance was not a significant predictor of suicidality, insomnia, appetite gain, ill temper, and well-being. These results suggest that attentional focus on bodily sensations is associated with increased global symptoms of depression as well as some specific physical symptoms, and interventions targeting body vigilance may be helpful in reducing such symptoms in college students.

929,Virtual reality-enabled treatment of nightmares,"We pilot tested the efficacy of a virtual reality-based imagery rehearsal and rescripting treatment (ReScript) for nightmares. Nineteen community volunteers (Mage = 49 years) who varied in terms of their nightmare distress levels participated in a 4-week-long trial of ReScript therapy. Participants used VR manual controls in an Oculus headset to manipulate 3 scary or threatening images per session with 2 sessions per week. The object was to manipulate these images into less scary or threatening images so as to gain cognitive control over intrusive imagery and to lessen overall anxiety or nightmare distress or nightmare daytime effects. Images were taken from the International Affective Picture System database and varied along 3 affective dimensions (valence, arousal, and dominance) important for nightmare imagery. Results demonstrated a significant reduction (from baseline to trial end) in anxiety levels, nightmare distress, and nightmare effects (all effect sizes .63 or above), as well as a significant decrease in anxiety words and a significant increase in cognitive process words in rescripted narratives. Nightmare frequency was also significantly reduced though effect size was small. No significant side or adverse effects were reported by participants during the 4-week trial. Indeed, Depersonalization and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Checklist scores significantly declined and mood function tests improved over the 4-week trial. We conclude that ReScript may be a safe and effective short-term therapy for nightmare distress but should next be tested with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

930,Chronic pain and depression among geriatric psychiatry inpatients,"Objectives: We examined whether chronic pain among depressed geriatric inpatients was associated with several clinical variables--comorbid psychiatric and medical diagnoses, length of hospitalization, suicidal ideation, and sleep duration. Methods: Medical charts of inpatients admitted to a geriatric psychiatry unit over 2 years were examined retrospectively; 148 patients with a depressive disorder were identified. Admission pain assessments were used to classify whether patients had chronic pain. Other variables of interest were collected from charts. Results: 62% of patients reported chronic pain. In multivariate regression analysis, depressed older adults with chronic pain were more likely to report suicidal ideation, be diagnosed with personality disorder, have higher medical burden, and experience decreased total sleep time compared to depressed older adults without chronic pain. Conclusions: Chronic pain--common in depressed older adults--may influence clinical features of depression and should be assessed as a possible suicide risk factor. Prospective studies should examine causal relationships and determine the effects of adequate pain treatment on depression course and suicide risk in older adults.

931,Posttraumatic stress disorder in individuals with diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders,"Although children and adolescents with developmental disabilities are said to have higher risks of abuse than those without, trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are little examined in those diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Our study aims to assess trauma types, prevalence, risk factors and symptoms; and PTSD in individuals with diagnosis of ASD. Participants were 69 children and adolescents (53 males, 16 females) who were consecutively followed-up at our clinic and met DSM-IV criteria for ASD. Assessment was done using semi-structured interview forms. 18 had trauma history and 12 were diagnosed with PTSD. Witnessing or being a victim of accidents/disasters/violence was the most common type of trauma. Interestingly, the rate of sexual and/or physical abuse was less than in the general population. Trauma history and PTSD rates were higher in girls than boys. Deterioration in social and communicative abilities, increase in stereotypes, aggression, distractibility, sleep disorders, agitation, hyperactivity, self-injury, and loss of self-care skills were the most common symptoms detected following trauma. These results underscore the importance of detailed assessment of behavioral and emotional problems in this group by ruling out any trauma history at periods which might otherwise be misdiagnosed as an exacerbation of symptoms of ASD.

932,Blunted HPA axis activity prior to suicide attempt and increased inflammation in attempters,"Background: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation is associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior. However, it is not clear whether such dysregulation exists prior to or is a consequence of attempt. Studies also show an activation of inflammatory responses in suicidal behavior but often combine attempters with those with ideation. Methods: The sample consisted of psychiatric inpatients, aged 15â€“30 years, admitted for suicide attempt (SA, n = 38), inpatients admitted for suicidal ideation with no prior history of attempts (SI, n = 40), and healthy controls (n = 37). We compared SA, SI, and controls on hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), which provides retrospective levels of cortisol and thus prior to the attempt in SA. We also compared them on the expression of genes in the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways previously implicated in suicidal behavior (GR or NR3C1, SKA2, FKBP5, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±); plasma C-Reactive Protein (CRP); and cellular measures of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity and stimulated production of IL-6. Results: We found lower HCC [Î² = âˆ’0.55, 95% CI (âˆ’0.96, âˆ’0.13), p = 0.01, ES = âˆ’0.54] in first-time SA compared to SI and controls. In addition, SA showed lower GR or NR3C1 (Î± isoform) mR [Î² = âˆ’5.11, 95% CI (âˆ’10.9, 0.73), p = 0.09, ES = âˆ’0.46], higher CRP [Î² = 0.94, 95% CI (âˆ’0.004, 1.9), p = 0.05, ES = 0.60], and higher TNF-Î± mR [Î² = 26.4, 95% CI (7.7, 45.2), p = 0.006, ES = 0.73]. Conclusions: This is the first study to differentiate youth who attempt suicide from those with suicidal ideation on HCC and to show that low HCC precedes suicide attempt. Suicide attempters also showed a distinct biological profile on several markers in both the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the ability of these biomarkers to predict suicidal behavior.

934,Genetic influences on evening preference overlap with those for bipolar disorder in a sample of Mexican Americans and American Indians,"Diurnal preference (e.g., being an owl or lark) has been associated with several psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder (BP), major depressive disorder, and substance use disorders. Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic influences on diurnal preference have exclusively included subjects of European ancestry. This study examined the genetic architecture of diurnal preference in two minority samples: a young adult sample of Mexican Americans (MAs), and a family-based sample of American Indians (AIs). Typed or imputed variants from exome chip data from the MA sample and low pass whole-genome sequencing from the AI cohort were analyzed using a mixed linear model approach for association with being an owl, as defined by a usual bedtime after 23:00 hrs. Genetic risk score (GRS) profiling detected shared genetic risk between evening preference and related disorders. Four variants in KIAA1549 like (KIAA1549L), a gene previously associated with attempted suicide in bipolar patients, were suggestively associated with being an owl at p < 1.82E-05; post hoc analyses showed the top variant trending in both the MA and AI cohorts at p = 2.50E-05 and p = .030, respectively. Variants associated with BP at p < .03 from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium nominally predicted being an owl in the MA/AI cohort at p = .012. This study provides some additional evidence that genetic risk factors for BP also confer risk for being an owl in MAs/AIs and that evening preference may be a useful endophenotype for future studies of BP.

935,Assessment for self-blame and trauma symptoms during the medical evaluation of suspected sexual abuse,"The purpose of this study was to describe behavioural and emotional symptoms and to examine the effect of abuse-related factors, family responses to disclosure, and child self-blame on these symptoms in children presenting for medical evaluations after disclosure of sexual abuse. A retrospective review was conducted of 501 children ages 8-17. Trauma symptoms were determined by two sets of qualitative measures. Abstracted data included gender, ethnicity, and age; severity of abuse and abuser relationship to child; child responses regarding difficulty with sleep, school, appetite/weight, sadness, or self-harm, parent belief in abuse disclosure, and abuse-specific self-blame; responses to the Trauma Symptom Checklist in Children-Alternate; and the parent's degree of belief in the child's sexual abuse disclosure. Overall, 83% of the children had at least one trauma symptom; 60% had difficulty sleeping and one-third had thoughts of self-harm. Child age and abuse severity were associated with 3 of 12 trauma symptoms, and abuse-specific self-blame was associated with 10 trauma symptoms, after controlling for other variables. The children of parents who did not completely believe the initial disclosure of abuse were twice as likely to endorse self-blame as children of parents who completely believed the initial disclosure. Screening for behavioural and emotional problems during the medical assessment of suspected sexual abuse should include assessment of self-blame and family responses to the child's disclosures. In addition, parents should be informed of the importance of believing their child during the initial disclosure of abuse and of the impact this has on the child's emotional response to the abuse.

Women were more than 4 times as likely as men to have tested positive for anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs. Major depression was found in 22.5%. Among Ss whose deaths were attributed to drug ingestion, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antidepressants were found in approximately one-third each, with little overlap. Clinical concerns include (1) the importance of recognizing depression in patients who complain of poor sleep, (2) the issue of multiple drug ingestion in suicide victims, and (3) the rising rate of barbiturate use in areas in which benzodiazepines are increasingly restricted by regulatory agencies.

We present a case of an adolescent male who today is a 65 year old with moderate mental retardation. He was previously observed as having severe challenging and self-injurious behaviour, sleeping disorder, hyperactivity, and masturbation. In the last year before reassessment he displayed loss of weight, muscle weakness resulting in wheelchair placement, upper respiratory infections, and fungal skin infections. After reassessment in 1998 the patient was started on treatment with a phenylalanine-restricted diet supplemented with vitamin B12, iron, and folie acid. At follow-up one year later the patient had regained his weight and was walking around freely. The challenging and self-injurious behaviour, and the masturbation, had ceased, and he was participating in social activities which he had previously not been able to participate in. At follow-up four years later he was still at this level of accomplishment. In general, this patient's quality of life had increased. We therefore recommend life-long treatment with phenylalanine restricted diet for persons with previously treated, and also for those with untreated, ...

938,Baseline dimensional psychopathology and future mood disorder onset: Findings from the Dutch Bipolar Offspring Study,"Objective: To identify the early signs of mood disorder development, specifically bipolar disorder (BD), in a population at familial risk for BD. Method: The sample included 107 Dutch adolescent bipolar offspring (age 12â€“21) followed into adulthood (age 22â€“32). Lifetime DSM-IV axis I diagnoses were examined at baseline, 1-, 5-, and 12- year follow-up. Symptoms were assessed at baseline on a 3-point Likert scale at baseline with the K-SADS-PL and were analyzed using symptom and sum scores. As observed in previous studies, BD typically starts with other mood disorders. Therefore, the sample was stratified in offspring with a mood diagnosis (n = 29) and without (n = 78) at baseline. Results: Subthreshold manic experiences proved the strongest predictor of BD conversion (n = 10; HR2.16, CI95% 1.23â€“3.78). At symptom level, elated mood, decreased need of sleep, racing thoughts, suicidal ideation, and middle insomnia were significantly associated with BD conversion. Depressive symptoms proved the strongest predictor for first mood episode onset (n = 28; HR1.27, CI95% 1.02â€“1.58). Conclusion: This study extends our knowledge of prodromal manifestations of BD in a high-risk population. Although preliminary, findings of this study provide potential targets for early identification and underscore the importance of detailed assessment of manic symptomatology in bipolar offspring.

Indicators of adolescent disease burden included Major Depressive Disorder, psychological distress, self-harm and suicide attempt. Risk factors included risky alcohol use, drug use, unprotected sex, smoking, BMI and sleep duration. The extent to which these risk factors co-occurred were investigated using tetrachoric correlations. Several risk indices were then constructed based on these risk factors. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves determined the precision with which these indices predicted the leading causes of adolescent disease burden.; Results: Risky alcohol use, drug use, smoking, unprotected sex, and sleep were all highly clustered lifestyle risk factors, whereas BMI was not. A risk index comprising risky alcohol use, drug use, unprotected sex and sleep duration predicted the disease burden outcomes with the greatest precision. 31.9% of the sample reported one or more of these behaviours.; Conclusions: This lifestyle risk factor index represents a useful summary metric in the context of adolescent health promotion and non-communicable disease prevention.

In the present secondary data analysis, a squared term confirmed the importance of both short and long total sleep time on suicidal behaviour. Total sleep time had a significant positive direct effect on suicidal behaviour (b = 0.20, SE = 0.08, P < 0.05), significant negative direct effects on insomnia symptoms (b = âˆ’1.67, SE = 0.13, P < 0.0001) and on depressive symptoms (b = âˆ’1.76, SE = 0.29, P < 0.0001). Depression had a significant positive effect on suicidal behaviour (b = 0.17, SE = 0.01, P < 0.0001), and significantly mediated the relationship between total sleep time and suicidal behaviour, but insomnia symptoms did not. Total sleep time squared had a significant positive relationship with suicidal behaviour (b = 0.02, SE = 0.01, P < 0.05), significant negative direct effects on insomnia symptoms (b = âˆ’0.12, SE = 0.01, P < 0.0001) and on depressive symptoms (b = âˆ’0.12, SE = 0.02, P < 0.0001). Depression had a significant positive effect on suicidal behaviour (b = 0.17, SE = 0.01, P < 0.0001), and significantly mediated the relationship between total sleep time and suicidal behaviour. These results suggest the importance of assessing for total sleep time in clinical settings with regard to suicide risk.

941,"Safety and efficacy of suvorexant during 1-year treatment of insomnia with subsequent abrupt treatment discontinuation: A phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","Background: Suvorexant (MK-4305) is an orexin receptor antagonist shown to be efficacious for insomnia over 3 months. We aimed to assess its clinical profile during and after 1 year of treatment. Methods: We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial at 106 investigational centres in the Americas, Australia, Europe, and South Africa from December, 2009, to August, 2011. Patients aged 18 years or older with primary insomnia by DSM-IV-TR criteria were assigned using a computer-generated randomised allocation schedule to receive nightly suvorexant (40 mg for patients younger than 65 years, 30 mg for patients aged 65 years or older) or placebo at a 2:1 ratio for 1 year with a subsequent 2-month randomised discontinuation phase in which patients on suvorexant either continued suvorexant or were abruptly switched to placebo while patients on placebo remained on placebo. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of suvorexant for up to 1 year. Secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of suvorexant for improving patient-reported subjective total sleep time (sTST) and time to sleep onset (sTSO) over the first month of treatment. Efficacy endpoints over the first month were assessed with a mixed model with terms for baseline value of the response variable, age, sex, region, treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01021813. Findings: 322 (62%) of 522 patients randomly assigned to receive suvorexant and 162 (63%) of 259 assigned to receive placebo completed the 1-year phase. Over 1 year, 362 (69%) of 521 patients treated with suvorexant experienced any adverse events compared with 164 (64%) of 258 treated with placebo. Serious adverse events were recorded in 27 patients (5%) who received suvorexant and 17 (7%) who received placebo. The most common adverse event, somnolence, was reported for 69 patients (13%) who received suvorexant and seven (3%) who received placebo. At month 1, suvorexant (517 patients in the efficacy population) showed greater efficacy than placebo (254 in the efficacy population) in improving sTST (38Â·7 min vs 16Â·0 min; difference 22Â·7, 95% CI 16Â·4 to 29Â·0; p < 0Â·0001) and sTSO (-18Â·0 min vs-8Â·4 min, difference -9Â·5, -14Â·6 to -4Â·5; p = 0Â·0002). Interpretation: Our findings show that suvorexant was generally safe and well tolerated over 1 year of nightly treatment in patients with insomnia, with efficacy noted for subjective measures of sleep onset and maintenance.

942,Insomnia and suicidal ideation in nonaffective psychosis,"Study Objectives: Insomnia is a common symptom in the clinical course of schizophrenia. There is a robust association between insomnia and suicidality in other psychiatric disorders. Two previous studies found associations between insomnia and suicide attempt or completed suicide in patients with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that greater insomnia would be associated with greater levels of suicidal ideation in patients with schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychoses.; Methods: We recruited 108 inpatients and outpatients age 18-65 between July 2010 and July 2016 with DSM-IV nonaffective psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder). We investigated relationships between current insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), suicidal ideation over the past week, and lifetime history of suicide attempt (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation [BSS]) in regression analyses.; Results: After controlling for potential confounders, insomnia was a significant indicator of suicidal ideation (Î² = 0.27, p = 0.032). Insomnia was also a significant indicator of a high BSS score (â‰¥16; OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.28, p = 0.029). Furthermore, participants with severe insomnia were almost 15 times more likely to have a lifetime history suicide attempt than participants without current insomnia (OR = 14.8, 95% CI: 1.4-157, p = 0.025). Insomnia was also an indicator of greater PANSS total (Î² = 0.33, p = 0.001), positive subscale (Î² = 0.32, p = 0.002), and general subscale (Î² = 0.40, p < 0.001) scores.; Conclusions: Insomnia is associated with suicidal ideation, lifetime suicide attempt, and greater psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that formal assessment of insomnia may be germane to the clinical care of patients with schizophrenia as a marker of suicide risk and symptom severity.; ","Miller, Brian J.; Parker, Carmen B.; Rapaport, Mark H.; Buckley, Peter F. & McCall, William V.",1,942
943,The evidence base of sleep restriction therapy for treating insomnia disorder,"Sleep restriction therapy is routinely used within cognitive behavioral therapy to treat chronic insomnia. However, the efficacy for sleep restriction therapy as a standalone intervention has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This review evaluates the evidence for the use of sleep restriction therapy in the treatment of chronic insomnia. The literature was searched using web-based databases, finding 1344 studies. Twenty-one were accessed in full (1323 were deemed irrelevant to this review). Nine were considered relevant and evaluated in relation to study design using a standardized study checklist and levels of evidence. Four trials met adequate methodological strength to examine the efficacy of therapy for chronic insomnia. Weighted effect sizes for self-reported sleep diary measures of sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency were moderate-to-large after therapy. Total sleep time indicated a small improvement. Standalone sleep restriction therapy is efficacious for the treatment of chronic insomnia for sleep diary continuity variables. Studies are insufficient to evaluate the full impact on objective sleep variables. Measures of daytime functioning in response to therapy are lacking. Variability in the sleep restriction therapy implementation methods precludes any strong conclusions regarding the true impact of therapy.

946,Mental health utilization among veterans at risk for suicide: Data from a post-deployment clinic,"The current study aim was to examine mental health characteristics in a sample of returning OEF/OIF/OND veterans initially enrolling in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care (N = 1,307), with a particular focus on a subgroup considered at risk for suicide (N = 445). Methods included examination of mental health screening measures and clinical interview data from a VA postdeployment clinic. Half of the sample met criteria for a mental health disorder, whereas 10% reported current suicidal or death ideation (e.g., thoughts of being better off dead or hurting oneself in some way) and 6% reported a history of suicide attempt. Sixty-eight percent of the at-risk subgroup accepted a referral for mental health treatment and a promising majority (78%) of those individuals attended their initial specialty mental health visit. At-risk veterans who accepted mental health referral were more likely to report current suicidal/death ideation; they were also more likely to have a diagnosis of a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder. Factors associated with mental health appointment attendance included older age, being enrolled in college, and more years of military service. Results highlight the importance of early screening and referral to appropriate mental health follow-up. Implications for clinical practice and increasing engagement in VA mental health services among veterans at risk for suicide are discussed.

This study characterized the clinical co-occurrences and potential subgroups in 160 children with autism spectrum disorders who presented to The Autism Center between 1999 and 2003. Medical and psychiatric co-occurrences included sleep disorders, epilepsy, food intolerance, gastrointestinal dysfunction, mood disorder, and aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. Sleep disorders were associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction (P < .05) and mood disorders (P < .01). Food intolerance was associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction (P = .001). Subjects with mood disorder tended to develop aggressive or self-injurious behaviors (P < .05). Developmental regression was not associated with increased co-occurrence of medical or psychiatric disorders. Medical co-occurrence did not present as a risk factor for psychiatric co-occurrence, and vice versa. These results showed a high prevalence of multiple medical and psychiatric co-occurrences. There may be common pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in clinical subgroups of autism spectrum disorders.

There was a prior major depressive episode at age 15 yrs. The S's family psychiatric history included alcoholism, but no known mood disorders. The S was treated with sertraline and diphenhydramine, following which the symptoms of depression disappeared. However, 3 days later, the S developed manic symptoms such as increased energy, little sleep, expansive affect, pressured speech, distractibility, racing thoughts, irritability, and impulsivity.

950,Sleep complaints associated with wish to die after a suicide crisis”an exploratory study,"The present study explores whether sleep concerns are associated with wish to die throughout a 1â€month time interval following a suicide crisis. Sixtyâ€eight patients admitted to the emergency department of a general or psychiatric hospital were enrolled. Sleep difficulties were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, selfâ€reported satisfaction with sleep and time in bed. Suicidal ideation was assessed through the presence of a wish to die at 1 month following a suicide crisis. Coâ€existing psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using the French version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Potential covariate factors such as personal and family history of suicidal behaviours and sociodemographic variables were accounted for. We found that wish to die was associated significantly with insomnia severity, low satisfaction with sleep and sleep duration 1 month after the suicide crisis, even after controlling for covariates. This exploratory study is limited by a small sample size, and results cannot be generalized to patients with psychotic disorders or alcohol use disorders. Also, other factors related potentially to suicidal ideation, such as depression severity, stressful events or levels of family support, were not accounted for. However, overall our study supports the assessment of sleep complaints as a potential indicator of suicide risk in the weeks that follow a suicide crisis.

Also reviewed are possible mediating factors involving changes in various peptidergic systems such as GLP-1 and Ghrelin. A number of psychosocial issues that might be involved are discussed, including lack of improvement in quality of life after surgery, continued or recurrent physical mobility restrictions, persistence or recurrence of sexual dysfunction and relationship problems, low self-esteem, and a history of child maltreatment.

952,"Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profiles of olanzapine long-acting injection: an open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized study in patients with schizophrenia","Background: This was the first study, to our knowledge, in patients with schizophrenia in which olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI) was used to attempt delivery of depot formulation in multiple therapeutic doses.; Objective: This study assessed the safety profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of olanzapine after single and multiple administrations of olanzapine LAI and evaluated maintenance of symptom control.; Methods: This was an open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized study of olanzapine LAI in patients with schizophrenia stabilized with oral olanzapine. Key inclusion criteria included well-tolerated and efficacious treatment with daily olanzapine. Patients were required to be receiving a stable oral dose for 4Â weeks before study entry with no requirement for as-needed additional antipsychotic medication within 2Â weeks before entry. Exclusion criteria included serious unstable illnesses, unresolved seizures, pregnancy or breastfeeding, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, narrow-angle glaucoma, or serious suicidal risk. Initially, 34 patients received olanzapine LAI as a single injection of 50 to 450 mg, and as the study progressed, 247 patients received consecutive injections of 100 to 405 mg olanzapine LAI administered every 2, 3, or 4 weeks for 3 to 6 months. Spontaneously reported adverse events were recorded at each visit. Analyses of efficacy and safety profile parameters were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. All hypotheses were tested at a 2-sided significance level of P < 0.05.; Results: Study participants had a mean age of 39 years and were primarily white men. The PK properties suggested prolonged release providing sustained olanzapine plasma concentrations and supporting a dosing interval â‰¤4 weeks. Olanzapine LAI doses of 150 or 300Â mg every 2Â weeks and 210 or 405Â mg every 4Â weeks provide mean steady-state olanzapine concentrations similar to those after oral administration of 5 to 20Â mg/d. The mean baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score of 17.27 decreased by 2.68 points, and the mean baseline Clinical Global Impression-Severity score of 3.39 decreased by 0.23 points, indicating that patients' psychiatric health was maintained or slightly improved. Significant mean weight gain (P < 0.001) and treatment-emergent changes in nonfasting glucose were observed. Incidence of weight gain â‰¥7% of baseline was observed in 17.8% of patients. The common adverse events were injection site pain, anxiety, sedation, insomnia, somnolence, and headache, and the safety profile for olanzapine LAI was comparable to that of oral olanzapine, except for injection site-related adverse events.; Conclusion: The safety profile and PK data from this study support continued clinical development of olanzapine LAI in controlled efficacy studies at doses â‰¤300 mg every 2 weeks or 405 mg every 4 weeks.

953,"3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: A randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial","Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100â€“125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. Findings: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n = 7), 75 mg (n = 7), or 125 mg (n = 12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of âˆ’58Â·3 [SD 9Â·8] and âˆ’44Â·3 [28Â·7]; p = 0Â·001) than the 30 mg group (âˆ’11Â·4 [12Â·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2Â·8 (95% CI 1Â·19â€“4Â·39) for the 75 mg group and 1Â·1 (0Â·04â€“2Â·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100â€“125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p = 0Â·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p = 0Â·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38Â·8 [SD 28Â·1] vs 87Â·1 [16Â·1]; p < 0Â·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment. Interpretation: Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

955,"Bereavement-related depressive episodes: Characteristics, 3-year-course, and implications for the DSM-5","Context: The DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episodes exclude brief episodes that are better accounted for by bereavement. However, a proposal has been made to remove this exclusion from the DSM-5. Objectives: To compare the demographic and psychiatric characteristics of participants with bereavement-related, single, brief (<2 months) depressive episodes and other types of depressive episodes and to compare the future risk of depression between these groups and participants without a history of depression at baseline. Design: A longitudinal, community-based, epidemiologic study conducted from August 1, 2001, through May 31, 2002 (wave 1), and from August 1, 2004, through September 30, 2005 (wave 2). Setting: The US general population, including residents of Hawaii and Alaska. Participants: Participants in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions waves 1 (n = 43 093) and 2 (n = 34 653). Main Outcome Measures: Demographic characteristics, age at onset, history of depression in first-degree relatives, impairment in role functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, lifetime mental health service use, and new depressive episodes during the 3-year follow-up period. Results: Compared with participants with other types of depression, those with bereavement-related, single, brief depressive episodes were more likely to experience later onset and to be black but less likely to have had impairment in role functioning, comorbid anxiety disorders, or a treatment history at baseline. Participants with bereavement-related, single, brief episodes were less likely than those with bereavement-unrelated, single, brief episodes to experience fatigue, increased sleep, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal ideations. The risk of new depressive episodes during the follow-up period among participants with bereavement-related, single, brief episodes was significantly lower than among participants with bereavement-unrelated, single, brief episodes and other types of depression but similar to the risk among the participants from the general population with no baseline history of depression. Conclusions: Bereavement-related, single, brief depressive episodes have distinct demographic and symptom profiles compared with other types of depressive episodes and are not associated with increased risk of future depression.

956,Potential benefits and limits of psychopharmacological therapies in pervasive developmental disorders,"The core symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are impairment in reciprocal social interaction, communication, narrow interests, and stereotyped behaviour. These are frequently severe and persistent, although their severity may change over the course of life. Furthermore, the frequently associated symptoms of self-injury, aggressive behaviour, impulsivity, poor attention, anxiety, depression, and sleep disruption, can become a major source of additional distress and interference in functioning. The causes of autism are not yet known, but there is a general consensus that ASDs are highly heritable. Comprehension of the neurobiological basis for autism-spectrum disorders is still in its initial stages: a large body of research, however, has established ASD signs and symptoms are of neurological origin, and suggest that autism is a distributed neural system disorder, which disproportionately impairs many higher order abilities. Currently available medical treatments, primarily address co-morbid symptoms, rather than core symptoms. Thus, in spite of recent advances in psychopharmacology, the treatment approach still has important limits and shows poor efficacy on global outcomes. A potential pathway for improving clinical outcomes is that of the personalised treatment for autism, by using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) - a valuable tool for drugs with narrow therapeutic index - as well as systematic genetic background assessment, foreseen in future applications. However, it is already possible to implement an active surveillance programme to address safety concerns and to optimise therapeutic drug interventions in ASD.;Autistic Disorder/*drug therapy, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/*drug therapy, Precision Medicine/*methods, Autistic Disorder/complications, Autistic Disorder/physiopathology, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/complications, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/physiopathology, Drug Monitoring/methods, Humans, Pharmacogenetics","Molteni, Massimo; Nobile, Maria; Cattaneo, Dario; Radice, Sonia & Clementi, Emilio",0,956
957,Duloxetine in the treatment of depression: an overview,"Depression is a disorder that can be classified in the categories of non-organic psychiatric disorders and mood disorders. Mood tone is an important psychic function involved in the adaptation to both our internal and external world. It is flexible, that is, it goes up when we are in positive and favorable conditions, but it goes down when we are in negative and unpleasant states. We can define depression as a condition when mood tone loses its flexibility, it goes down and it's no longer influenced by favorable external events. In fact, depression is characterized by changes in the way how the affected individual thinks, feels and acts. Even if this change occurs gradually, a depressed subject is not the same as before. For example, a brilliant student could be persuaded to be not able to finish his studies; an affectionate mother could start to neglect her sons; an enterprising worker could lose every interest for his activity. Moreover, a depressed person doesn't care of his aspect or of himself. The surviving instinct could leave place to the desire to stop his own life. The most evident characteristic of depression in the adulthood is a sad mood, a gloomy solitary and apathetic attitude. A depressed subject could cry also with no apparent reason, he could have difficulty falling asleep or he could wake up very early in the morning and no longer returns to sleep. Or, instead, he could sleep more than usually and he could feel tired persistently. He could lose appetite and weight, or, in some cases, he could eat much more than usually and he could gain weight. Typically, a depressed person feels himself in a extremely negative way, he could think to be hopeless and helpless and he often condemns himself for small guilty. A depressed subject is pessimistic about himself and his own future; he loses interest in all what happens around him and he gets no satisfaction from the activities that before were pleasant. Some persons can be depressed also if they don't show evident signs of depression, but they complain for physical symptoms or they abuse of alcohol or other substances. It has been estimated that in the industrialized Western world one to six persons has a depressive episode at least once during his life; at present, the incidence of depression in the general population is around 5% with clear cut prevalence in the female sex. This leads to high social costs: behind the short-term inability, we have to consider also the long term inability (it has been estimated that, in 2020, depression will represent the second most frequent cause of permanent inability) as well as the suicide risk, the proved major susceptibility of depressed subjects to various non-psychiatric pathologies and the increased rate of premature deaths of depressed individuals as compared to the general population. The present work not only evaluates the drugs used for the treatment of depression, but it focuses also on those studies that investigated the efficacy of a second generation drug: Duloxetine that has a higher selectivity of action and a better tolerability profile as compared to first generation medications. These characteristics make Duloxetine the most effective therapeutic choice to improve both psychological and somatic symptoms of depression in order to get higher rates of symptomatic remission on depressive episodes.;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depression/*drug therapy, Thiophenes/*therapeutic use, Animals, Depression/classification, Depression/etiology, Depression/physiopathology, Duloxetine Hydrochloride, Humans, Psychotherapy","Monteleone, Francesco; Caputo, Mariella; Tecce, Mario Felice & Capasso, Anna",0,957
958,Effectiveness of Three Types of Interventions in Patients with Fibromyalgia in a Region of Southern Catalonia,"Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments can be used to alleviate the symptoms of fibromyalgia, although none of them are completely effective at present. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of different therapies in three groups of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The sample for this randomized controlled trial was made up of 66 people diagnosed with fibromyalgia in southern Catalonia. In turn, this sample was divided into three groups of 22 participants each, who were treated with: i) cervical infiltration with botulinum toxin, ii) group problem-solving therapy, or iii) both therapies. The variables recorded were quality of life, suicidal thoughts, perception of pain, quality of sleep, and satisfaction. Female patients composed 96.9% (nÂ =Â 64) of the study sample. Satisfaction with the infiltration was 5.1Â Â±Â 2.7 points, while in group problem-solving therapy it was 6.6Â Â±Â 3.2. Self-perceived health in the infiltration group (pÂ =Â .016) and the therapy group (pÂ =Â .001) improved after the intervention took place. The risk of suicide decreased in the both treatments/groups (pÂ =Â .049). Pain was reduced by 31.8% with infiltration, 13.6% with therapy, and 22.7% with both treatments. Anxiety/depression decreased by 45% with therapy, 36.3% with infiltration, and 36.3% with both treatments. The results also showed that the use of both treatments significantly reduces suicidal thoughts (pÂ =Â .049). In conclusion, this study showed the complexity of reducing chronic pain and increasing the quality of life of people with fibromyalgia.; Copyright Â© 2015 American Society for Pain Management Nursing.

959,Efficacy and tolerability of milnacipran: an overview,"The relative benefits and risks of milnacipran, a novel antidepressant which selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline, have been evaluated in comparative trials against tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A total of 2462 patients with major depressive disorders have been investigated. At the optimal dose (50 mg twice a day), the efficacy of milnacipran was equivalent to that of the TCAs, with response rates of approximately 65% in both cases. Milnacipran was consistently effective against all of the principal elements of depression (anxiety, cognitive function, sleep and psychomotor retardation), and did not produce sedation or the emergence of suicidal thoughts. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI-3) score, a measure of the overall therapeutic impact of a treatment, was significantly higher with milnacipran than with TCAs (1.98 versus 1.84, p < 0.05). TCAs were associated with a higher frequency of adverse events than milnacipran, particularly with respect to anticholinergic-like effects; dysuria was the only adverse event occurring twice as frequently with milnacipran than with TCAs. Compared with TCAs, milnacipran was also associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular adverse events. No haematological abnormalities occurred during treatment with milnacipran, and the incidence of abnormal liver function tests tended to be lower with milnacipran than with TCAs. In comparisons with SSRIs, milnacipran produced significantly higher response rates. The CGI-3 scores were significantly higher in milnacipran-treated patients (2.64 versus 2.32, p < 0.05). The adverse event profiles of the two treatments were similar, as was the incidence of abnormal liver function tests. These studies suggest that milnacipran offers clinical advantages over TCAs in terms of tolerability, and over SSRIs in terms of efficacy. In particular, the lack of cardiovascular adverse events appears to offer advantages in cases of deliberate overdose. To date, 15 such overdoses have occurred; none was fatal and each had a favourable outcome. The reproducible pharmacokinetic characteristics of milnacipran present further advantages over both groups of agents, due to lack of drug accumulation and a low risk of drug interactions.;Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Cyclopropanes/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, Cyclopropanes/adverse effects, Headache/chemically induced, Humans, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects","Montgomery, S A; Prost, J F; Solles, A & Briley, M",0,959
960,The prevention of recurrent suicidal acts,"1 There have been few controlled prospective investigations into the prevention of suicidal behaviour and by and large they have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of social work, psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment. 2 A group of 58 high-risk patients with multiple episodes of suicidal behaviour was treated with mianserin 30 mg at night or placebo in a six month double-blind trial of the efficacy of an antidepressant in reducing suicidal behaviour. 3 Patients were screened for depression, schizophrenia and organic disease. Patients were diagnosed as suffering from personality disorders according to DSM-III criteria mainly borderline or histrionic. 4 There was no significant difference in outcome between the mianserin and placebo treated group at any point in the six month study. 5 An item analysis of the MADRS showed that at entry the item 'reduced appetite' predicted subsequent suicidal attempt. The total MADRS score did not predict further suicidal acts at entry but was highly significant at four weeks. At four weeks the items 'reduced sleep' and 'reduced appetite' were highly significant predictors of further suicidal acts and the items 'lassitude', 'suicidal thoughts', 'inability to feel' and 'pessimistic thoughts' were significant predictors.;Dibenzazepines/*therapeutic use, Mianserin/*therapeutic use, Suicide/*prevention & control, Adult, Borderline Personality Disorder/drug therapy, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy, Female, Histrionic Personality Disorder/drug therapy, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Recurrence","Montgomery, S A; Roy, D & Montgomery, D B",1,960
961,The clinical profile of mianserin,"Discusses the benefits and risks of mianserin, which appears to be safer than the older tricyclic antidepressants. Amitriptyline and dothiepin are the most dangerous with 46-48 deaths per million prescriptions. Claims for relative safety in overdose with the newer antidepressants (mianserin [6 per million], lofepramine [0], and trazadone [11 per million]) are supported by calculations from coroners' reports in England and Wales. Mianserin appears effective in treating endogenous depression. Its sedative property is useful in treating disturbed sleep.

962,The effect of second-generation antipsychotic drugs on sleep parameters in patients with unipolar or bipolar disorder,"Sleep disturbances predominantly take the form of insomnia in patients with unipolar disorder, while patients with bipolar disorder show a decreased need for sleep. Sleep impairment in these patients is a risk factor for the development of a major depressive episode and suicidal behavior. Administration of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone as augmentation therapy or monotherapy to unipolar and bipolar disorder patients, respectively, has been shown to improve sleep continuity and sleep architecture. Thus, their use by these patients could ameliorate their sleep disorder.

963,Treatment Attendance and Suicidal Behavior 1 Month and 3 Months After a Suicide Attempt: A Comparison Between Two Samples,"This study investigated attendance of treatment and follow-up characteristics in two samples of suicide attempters with different lengths of follow-up, that is after one month and after three months. They did not differ initially. After one month, most of the treatment non-attenders (32%) had not jet established an outpatient contact after inpatient treatment, while after three months, 38% of the patients had no psychiatric treatment. At one month, the patients more often had sleep disturbances, expressed hopelessness, and they also more often expressed other kinds of problems. After one and three months 36% and 30%, respectively, had suicidal thoughts. In both samples, these patients more often than the others expressed a need of professional help, regardless of ongoing treatment. Probably there is a critical period of time in which to engage the patient in treatment, and perhaps more than one follow-up contact should be made.

Common indications were depressed mood, agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. Patient clinical severity and complexity was associated with prescribing. Adverse effects, mostly minor, were recorded in 23% of antidepressant prescriptions, 39% of antipsychotic prescriptions, and 13% of anxiolytic prescriptions. Second generation antipsychotic prescription was associated with subsequent new onset binge eating, in this preliminary observational study. Self-harm by overdose of psychotropics occurred in 11% of patients prescribed medication.; Conclusions: Psychotropic medications were frequently prescribed to adolescent eating disorder patients to treat distressing symptoms. Prospective randomised controlled trials to clarify efficacy and safety are needed. Given the difficulties of conducting clinical trials in this population, services are encouraged to monitor and audit medication safety and efficacy in everyday practice, and to report their findings.; Adolescent, Adverse effects, Binge eating, Child, Drug therapy, Eating disorders, Pharmacology","Moore, Julia K.; Watson, Hunna J.; Harper, Emily; McCormack, Julie & Nguyen, Thinh",0,964
965,Symptom-based predictors of a 10-year chronic course of treated depression,"The high likelihood of a chronic course of depression underscores the need to identify at intake patients most at risk for long-term nonremission. In a naturalistic study of 313 unipolar depressed patients (mean age 37.6 yrs), potential symptom-based risk factors were assessed at treatment intake and were used to predict a chronic course of treated depression over a 10-yr interval. The prototypic chronically depressed patient was an individual who at baseline experienced more severe symptoms of fatigue, loss of interest in usual activities, trouble sleeping, and thoughts about death or suicide; was not calm, successful, or self-confident; and did not socialize with friends outside the home, and frequently coped with stressors by avoiding other people. A larger number of risk factors was associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing a chronic course. High-risk patients who received more psychological treatment during the index episode were more likely to experience a long-term course of remission or partial remission.

966,Barriers to achieving treatment goals: A focus on sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction,"Background: Patients who meet the criteria for a major depressive episode experience a constellation of symptoms, and different symptom configurations may reflect distinct underlying neurological disturbances. Similarly, the differing receptor profiles of the various antidepressants may explain relatively low remission rates and persistent symptoms even after remission. In particular, depressed patients frequently display altered circadian rhythms, sleep disturbances, and diurnal mood variation. Exploring treatments that can restore mood while having a positive impact on circadian rhythms and sleep would greatly improve the ability to treat this core features of depression. Methods: The mechanisms of action of the various classes of antidepressants, their effects on sleep and issues beyond sleep, including sexual dysfunction, are explored, along with questions relating to adherence. Results: Unfortunately, persistent sleep problems are among the most difficult-to-treat residual symptoms of depression. Many of the currently available antidepressants have adverse effects on circadian processes, including sleep, and may actually worsen sleep problems. Tolerability is also an enduring issue; SSRI and SNRI antidepressants are associated with central nervous sysytem and gastrointestinal effects, sexual side effects and suicidality. Improved drug tolerability would not only minimize distressing adverse effects, but would also improve adherence, thus maximizing the chances of successful treatment. Conclusions: The complexity of managing a major depressive episode is well illustrated by sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction, two core symptoms of MDD that may also be caused or exacerbated by antidepressant therapy. Future antidepressants should alleviate symptoms without adversely affecting sleep or sexual function. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

967,"Latent class analysis of manic and depressive symptoms in a population-based sample in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil","Background: Current diagnostic criteria cannot capture the full range of bipolar spectrum. This study aims to clarify the natural co-segregation of manic-depressive symptoms occurring in the general population. Methods: Using data from the Sao Paulo Catchment Area Study, latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to eleven manic and fourteen depressive symptoms assessed through CIDI 1.1 in 1464 subjects from a community-based study in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All manic symptoms were assessed, regardless of presence of euphoria or irritability, and demographics, services used, suicidality and CIDI/DSM-IIIR mood disorders used to external validate the classes. Results: The four obtained classes were labeled Euthymics (EU; 49.1%), Mild Affectives (MA; 31.1%), Bipolars (BIP; 10.7%), and Depressives (DEP; 9%). BIP and DEP classes represented bipolar and depressive spectra, respectively. Compared to DEP class, BIP exhibited more atypical depressive characteristics (hypersomnia and increase in appetite and/or weight gain), risk of suicide, and use of services. Depressives had rates of atypical symptoms and suicidality comparable to oligosymptomatic MA class subjects. Limitations: The use of lay interviewers and DSM-IIIR diagnostic criteria, which are more restrictive than the currently used DSM-IV TR. Conclusions: Findings of high prevalence of bipolar spectrum and of atypical symptoms and suicidality as indicators of bipolarity are of great clinical importance, due to different treatment needs, and higher severity. Lifetime sub-affective and syndromic manic symptoms are clinically significant, arguing for the need of revising DSM bipolar spectrum categories.

968,Problems associated with long-term treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,"Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are now widely used as a first-line treatment for depression and many other psychiatric conditions, are generally well tolerated, they are not devoid of side effects. Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patient's quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode.

Subjects were 40 high school employees. The sleep education program lasted 4.5 hours and consisted of sleep science information, and sleep hygiene education including the risk of sleep related breathing disorder resulting from alcohol intake. Sleep conditions were evaluated by self-administered questionnaires at baseline and approximately 1 month later. The mean the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was significantly decreased by 1.2 points (P = 0.04), while the mean sleep duration was significantly decreased by 10 minutes (P = 0.02). Shortened sleep duration coincided with a decrease in sleepiness. This may indicate an improvement in sleep quality. The percentage of habitual alcohol intake at bedtime was significantly decreased (from 38.5% (15/39) to 20.5% (8/39), P = 0.04). Subjects who stopped alcohol intake at bedtime (n = 8) received the most benefit, with decreased scores of ESS and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), although the reductions were not significant. This education program offers the possibility of improving sleep conditions among the general population, especially in those who cease habitual alcohol intake at bedtime.

Methods: Twenty-four participants (19â€“49 years) were randomized to one of two treatment sequences in which either esketamine 84 mg or placebo was intranasally administered in a double-blind, two-period crossover design. Primary measures included five tests of CogstateÂ® computerized test battery assessed at 1 h predose and 40 min, 2, 4, and 6 h postdose. Secondary measures included the Mental Effort Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and safety. Results: Esketamine was associated with significant cognitive performance impairment at 40 min postdose for all five CogstateÂ® tests (Detection p = 0.0011, Identification p = 0.0006, One-Card Learning p = 0.0040, One Back p = 0.0017, and Groton Maze Learning Test p < 0.0001) versus placebo. In contrast, performance on these tests did not differ significantly between esketamine and placebo at 2, 4, or 6 h postdose. Secondary outcomes indicated a significant, transient increase from baseline under esketamine versus placebo at 40 min postdose on the Mental Effort Scale and at 40 min and 2 h postdose on KSS (p < 0.0001 for both); however, no significant difference was observed on these outcomes between esketamine and placebo at later timepoints. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness (67%), nausea (37.5%), disturbance in attention (29.2%), and fatigue (29.2%); the majority were considered mild in severity. Conclusions: Esketamine was associated with cognitive performance decline, and greater effort was required to complete the test battery versus placebo at 40 min postdose, which returned to placebo-comparable levels by 2 h postdose.

971,The use of psychotropic agents in pregnancy and lactation,"The question of which psychotropic medications are safe during pregnancy is likely to remain unanswered for many years to come. There are ethical limitations to performing the type of prospective controlled studies required to answer a scientific question of this type definitively. At the present time, in all patients with worsening psychiatric illness during pregnancy, be it in the schizophrenic, affective, anxiety disorder, or personality disorder spectrum, outpatient psychotherapy, hospitalization, and milieu therapy should be attempted prior to the routine use of psychotropic medication. Prior to pregnancy, withdrawal of psychotropic medications should be attempted under close supervision. Situations will arise in which hospitalization is not sufficient to avert psychotic decompensation. In both schizophrenic illnesses and acute mania, neuroleptics should be used, especially in the first trimester in preference to lithium. The use of high-potency neuroleptics appears preferable to low-potency agents as the first line of therapy, although subsequent management decisions will depend on ability to control side effects. In depression, TCAs should be used in cases of suicidality or incapacitating vegetative signs after the first trimester if supportive measures fail. There appears to be no rationale for withdrawal of TCAs prior to labor. In the third trimester, use of TCAs, low-potency neuroleptics, or lithium should be accompanied by obstetrical surveillance. In severe anxiety or insomnia following the first trimester, the occasional use of benzodiazepines may be warranted except during labor and the first week postpartum. The chronic use of benzodiazepines during any phase of pregnancy and in breastfeeding women is contraindicated. The importance of close rapport between the treating physician and the pregnant or breastfeeding patient cannot be overstated and will obviate or decrease reliance on psychotropic medication in many cases.;Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*etiology, Lactation/*drug effects, Mental Disorders/*drug therapy, Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy, Psychotropic Drugs/*adverse effects, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Psychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use","Mortola, J F",0,971

It is thus important to have suitable screening instruments and to implement care pathways for suicide prevention in every epilepsy center. The aim of this study is to validate the use of the Neurological Disorder Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDIE) as a suicidality-screening instrument.; Methods: The study sample included adult patients with epilepsy assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the NDDIE.

974,Cholesterol reduction and non-illness mortality: meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials,"Objective: To investigate the association between cholesterol lowering interventions and risk of death from suicide, accident, or trauma (non-illness mortality).; Design: Meta-analysis of the non-illness mortality outcomes of large, randomised clinical trials of cholesterol lowering treatments.; Studies Reviewed: 19 out of 21 eligible trials that had data available on non-illness mortality. INTERVENTIONS REVIEWED: Dietary modification, drug treatment, or partial ileal bypass surgery for 1-10 years.; Main Outcome Measure: Deaths from suicides, accidents, and violence in treatment groups compared with control groups.; Results: Across all trials, the odds ratio of non-illness mortality in the treated groups, relative to control groups, was 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.52; P=0.20). The odds ratios were 1.28 (0.94 to 1.74; P=0.12) for primary prevention trials and 1.00 (0.65 to 1.55; P=0.98) for secondary prevention trials. Randomised clinical trials using statins did not show a treatment related rise in non-illness mortality (0.84, 0.50 to 1.41; P=0.50), whereas a trend toward increased deaths from suicide and violence was observed in trials of dietary interventions and non-statin drugs (1.32, 0.98 to 1.77; P=0.06). No relation was found between the magnitude of cholesterol reduction and non-illness mortality (P=0.23).; Conclusion: Currently available evidence does not indicate that non-illness mortality is increased significantly by cholesterol lowering treatments.

975,Prediction of suicidal behavior in clinical research by lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior ascertained by the Electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale,"Objective: To evaluate whether lifetime suicidal ideation with intention to act and/or suicidal behaviors reported at baseline predict risk of prospectively reporting suicidal behavior during subsequent study participation. Method: Data from studies using the electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) to prospectively monitor suicidal ideation and behaviors between September 2009 and May 2011 were analyzed. Studies included patients with major depressive disorder, insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, and fibromyalgia. Records for 35,224 eC-SSRS assessments were extracted. Incomplete assessments and eC-SSRS records from patients missing a baseline assessment or with no prospective follow-up assessments were excluded. Baseline lifetime eC-SSRS reports were categorized as negative (no lifetime ideation with intent to act or prior suicidal behavior) or positive (lifetime ideation with intent to act but no prior behavior, no ideation with intent to act but prior behavior, or both lifetime ideation with intent and prior behavior). Results: 3,776 patients completed a baseline and 1 or more follow-up assessments. The mean follow-up period was 64 days. Of patients with negative lifetime reports, 2.4% subsequently reported suicidal behavior during study participation, compared to 12.0% of patients with lifetime ideation with intent only (OR = 5.55; 95% CI, 2.65-11.59), 9.6% of patients with lifetime behavior only (OR = 4.33; 95% CI, 2.94-6.39), and 18.3% of patients with both (OR = 9.13; 95% CI, 6.47-12.88). Sensitivity and specificity of positive reports for identifying suicidal behaviors were 0.67 and 0.76, respectively. Conclusions: Patients reporting lifetime suicidal ideation with intent to act and/or prior suicidal behavior at baseline are 4 to 9 times more likely to prospectively report suicidal behavior during study participation.

976,Off-label treatment of severe childhood narcolepsy-cataplexy with sodium oxybate,"Study Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and side-effect profile of off-label sodium oxybate (gamma hydroxy butyrate) therapy in severe childhood narcolepsy-cataplexy. Design: Retrospective; chart review. Setting: A multidisciplinary tertiary sleep center. Patients: A group of eight children with severe narcolepsy-cataplexy diagnosed on the basis of clinical history, nocturnal polysomnography and the multiple sleep latency test were studied. A modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale and an arbitrary cataplexy severity scale (1 = minimal weakness, 2 = voluntarily preventable falls, 3 = falls to the ground) were utilized. Interventions: Sodium oxybate therapy; concurrent medications were maintained. Measurements and Results: Before sodium oxybate therapy, all subjects had suboptimally controlled sleepiness and cataplexy. Following treatment with sodium oxybate, 7/8 subjects (88%) improved. Cataplexy frequency decreased from a median of 38.5 to 4.5/ week (p = 0.0078). Cataplexy severity decreased from 2.75 to 1.75 (p = 0.06). The Epworth Sleepiness Scores improved from a median of 19 to 12.5 (p = 0.02). Suicidal ideation, dissociative episodes, tremor and constipation occurred in one subject each and terminal insomnia in two. Three of the 8 (38%) discontinued therapy. Two stopped the drug owing to side effects and one due to problems with postal delivery of the medication. Conclusions: This is the first report on sodium oxybate therapy in childhood narcolepsy-cataplexy. Our finding of improvement in cataplexy and sleepiness suggests that this medication is effective in treating severe childhood narcolepsy-cataplexy.

977,Assessment and treatment of a person at risk for psychosis in a culturally complex case,"Presents a case report of a 14-year-old Asian American girl presented to the emergency room with suicide ideation and a plan to over-dose on medication. he reported the following symptoms of depression: chronic feelings of sadness, negative future outlook, anhedonia, agitation, indecision, and sleep disturbance. The symptoms had been present for 1 year. This case highlights the importance of early identification of patients at risk of developing a psychotic disorder. The Structural Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), which was used in this case, has been found to be a reliable and valid measure to identify pre-psychotic symptoms. It is critical to identify patients in the at-risk stage of psychosis to reduce the severity of symptoms and possibly prevent the transition to first-episode psychosis. There are a number of ways to successfully intervene with population, including CBT, dietary supplementation with fish oil, and pharmacologic interventions.

978,The mental health status and barriers to seeking care in rural women veterans,"Rural women Veterans represent a vulnerable, underserved population who encounter significant obstacles when seeking quality mental health services. However, there is a paucity of research devoted specifically to this population. To address this gap, we examined the mental health status of a group of rural women Veterans, including psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, insomnia, suicide risk, the incidence of military sexual trauma (MST), and the perceived stigma and barriers to seeking care. One hundred and one rural Veterans interested in a womenâ€™s wellness retreat program completed written inventories. Overall, they demonstrated significant levels of psychological distress, with averages ranging between the 82nd and 88th percentiles for depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms. In addition, 35% scored above the clinical screening level for general distress, 40% reported symptoms above the cutoff level for probable PTSD, and 70% demonstrated clinical levels of insomnia. Notably, 36% of the total sample evidenced a risk for suicide, and 68% reported MST. MST was significantly associated with increased levels of psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and suicidality. Sixty-nine percent of participants reported at least one barrier to seeking mental health services, with scheduling difficulties, distance from facilities, and internalized stigma endorsed the most frequently. The mental health status of rural women Veterans, coupled with perceived barriers and internalized stigma, underscore the urgency of developing innovative strategies to increase the accessibility and utilization of effective services for this at-risk population.

979,Development of a psychosocial distress measure for Ugandan adolescents living with HIV,"Psychological distress among adolescents living with HIV (ALH) has been associated with risky behaviors including non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy, leading to increased risk for AIDS morbidity and mortality. Efforts to establish the nature, prevalence, and impact of psychological distress among ALH in Uganda are hindered by the lack of culturally relevant assessment tools. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a measure for psychological distress for Ugandan ALH aged 12-19 years (N = 508; 53.1 % female). Using a mixed method approach, we developed and tested a 25-item checklist with six subscales--anhedonia, depressive-anxiety, isolation, suicidal ideation, sleep problems, and somatization. We found adequate reliability for the scale (Î± = 0.89), and a satisfactory measurement structure in our confirmatory factor analyses (RMSEA <1.0, and CFI and TLI >0.90). We discuss the potential use of this culturally sensitive scale to examine psychological distress among ALH in Uganda. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Forty seven per cent of cases had no formal education. The cancers were gastrointestinal tract 33%, blood and lymphoid tissue (26%), bone and muscle (11.9%), skin (9.4%) and genitourinary tract (4.8%). Treatment given was chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Ninety three per cent were unable to cope. Chief complaints were pain, inability to work, feeling miserable and concerns were families, health and work retardation. Modified Beck's depression score was 20%, with major issues being; work retardation, insomnia, weight loss, and anorexia. Most affected were, age group 27-35 years (and least 13-26 years), uneducated, living in Nairobi (city), having carcinomas, treatment with combined surgery and radiotherapy. Low education level and residence in Nairobi coped poorly. Radiation therapy group appeared to cope better than other modalities.; Conclusion: The issues affecting the quality of life of male cancer patients stated were pain, inability to work, poor coping with cancer and psychological reactions of work retardation, insomnia, weight loss, fatigability and depression.

981,Major depression in a small group of adults with Down syndrome,"The clinical histories and treatment of the nine individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and major depression (MD) previously noted in a report on the psychopathology of a population of 164 adults with DS with and without health disorders from a Down Syndrome Clinic are presented (Myers & Pueschel, 1991). The clinical characteristics including DSM-III-R (1987) criteria of these 9 patients plus 13 individuals with DS and MD described in case reports in the literature are summarized. Depression is rarely verbalized and commonly appears as crying, depressed appearance, or mood lability. Vegetative symptoms of disinterest with severe withdrawal and mutism, psychomotor retardation, decreased appetite, weight loss, and insomnia are prominent. Verbal expression of preoccupations of suicide, death, self-depreciation, and guilt were infrequent and may either be not present or not reported due to mutism or moderate level of mental retardation (MR). Hallucinations were prominent. Family history of depression was infrequent. Psychological stressors were noted mostly in the study sample and not in the 13 from the literature. The pattern of vegetative symptomatology with few verbal complaints and prominent hallucinations may be related to moderate mental retardation in these groups with DS rather than specifically to DS.;Depressive Disorder/*psychology, Down Syndrome/*psychology, Adjustment Disorders/diagnosis, Adjustment Disorders/psychology, Adult, Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis, Alzheimer Disease/psychology, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis, Diagnosis, Differential, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales","Myers, B A & Pueschel, S M",0,981

However, few studies have investigated the particularity of completed suicide in South Korea.Methods: Study subjects consisted of 2,838 suicide cases and 56,758 age and sex matched living controls from a national representative sample of 1,025,340 South Koreans. They were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) with follow-up up to 12 years. We obtained information on primary diagnosis of any ICD-10 disorder along with suicide cases during their lifetime.Results: Among ICD-10 disorders, depression was the most common disorder (19.10%, n=542), found in victims of completed suicides except for common medical disorders such as hypertensive crisis, respiratory tract infection or arthropathies. After adjusting for sex, age, economic status, disability, and disorders, schizophrenia showed the strongest association with suicide (AOR: 28.56, 95% CI: 19.58-41.66) among all ICD-10 disorders, followed by psoriasis, multiple body injury, epilepsy, sleep disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder. For age groups, ≤19 years was associated with anxiety disorder (AOR=80.65, 95% CI: 13.33-487.93), 20-34 years with epilepsy (AOR=134.92, 95% CI: 33.69-540.37), both 35-49 years (AOR=108.57, 95% CI: 37.17-317.09) and 50-65 years (AOR=189.41 95% CI: 26.59-1349.31), with schizophrenia, and >65 years (AOR=44.7, 95% CI: 8.93-223.63) with psoriasis.Conclusion: Psychiatric and physical disorders carried greatly increased risks and numbers of suicides in South Korea. Schizophrenia was the strongest risk factor, especially 35-65 years, and depression was the most common in suicide victims among ICD-10 disorders in South Korea","Na EJ; Lee H; Myung W; Fava M; Mischoulon D; Paik JW; Hong JP; Choi KW; Kim H; Jeon HJ,",1,982
983,Sleep disorders and the interpersonal“psychological theory of suicide: Independent pathways to suicidality?,"Background: Although sleep disorders are a risk factor for suicidal behavior little research has examined why sleep disorders confer suicide risk. The present study examined the relation between two sleep disorders, insomnia symptoms and nightmares, and suicide risk in the context of Joiner's interpersonalâ€“psychological theory of suicide (IPTS). Methods: The present study utilized two large samples (N = 747 and 604) recruited from two large public universities in the Southeast. Both studies included measures of insomnia symptoms, nightmares, depressive symptoms, and prior suicide attempts. In addition, study one contained a measure of suicide risk. Results: In study 1, the relations between insomnia symptoms and both suicide risk and prior attempts were not significant after controlling for the IPTS. However, nightmares were related to both suicide risk and suicide attempts independent of the IPTS. Furthermore, nightmares nearly missed significance in the prediction of suicide risk (p = 0.054) and significantly predicted suicide attempts even after controlling for depressive symptoms. In study 2, both insomnia and nightmares were found to be significantly associated with prior suicide attempts after controlling for the IPTS and depressive symptoms. Limitations: The study is limited by its use of a college sample and cross-sectional design. Conclusions: These studies suggest that the IPTS may not explain the relation between sleep problems and suicidality. More research is needed to understand the mechanism by which sleep disorders confer suicide risk, which is clinically relevant as it may inform specific interventions to reduce the adverse effects of sleep disorders.

985,Presence and persistence of sleep-related symptoms and suicidal ideation in psychiatric inpatients,"Background: Although sleep is an important risk factor for suicidal behavior, research has yet to examine the association between sleep problems and suicidality across the course of inpatient treatment. This study examined the relationship among sleep-related symptoms and suicidal ideation across inpatient treatment. Aims: To examine whether poor sleep at admission longitudinally predicts less improvement in suicidal ideation over the course of treatment. Further, to examine whether suicidal ideation is reduced in patients whose sleep does not improve. Method: The study utilized the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II, which contains items measuring depressive symptoms, sleep-related symptoms, and suicidal ideation. The study sample consisted of 1,529 adult psychiatric inpatients. Patients were assessed at admission, biweekly, and at treatment termination. Results: Admission fatigue, loss of energy, and change in sleep pattern were associated with higher levels of suicidal ideation at admission and discharge. Fatigue at admission predicted suicidal ideation at termination independent of admission depression and suicidal ideation. Individuals whose sleep did not improve over the course of treatment had significantly higher suicidal ideation scores at termination relative to those whose sleep symptoms improved, after controlling for sleep, depression, and suicidal ideation scores at admission. Conclusion: These findings suggest that persistence of sleep-related symptoms warrants clinical attention in the treatment of suicidal patients.

In particular, the paper defines nightmare disorder and then summarize the recent literature examining the clinical relevance of nightmare disorder, including its relation to post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric conditions. The relation between nightmares and suicidality is also discussed. Recent findings on the treatment of nightmare with imagery rehearsal therapy and prazosin are then summarized. Lastly, the paper comments on potential future uses of nightmare treatment including using imagery rehearsal therapy or prazosin as a first-line intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder and using these treatments as an adjunctive therapy to reduce suicide risk in those at risk of suicide with nightmares.

987,"Nightmares: Under-Reported, Undetected, and Therefore Untreated","Objective: Nightmares are a robust and modifiable predictor of increased suicidality and poor psychiatric outcomes, yet nightmare screening and treatment remain rare, even in sleep centers. This paper aims to examine what proportion of nightmare sufferers have discussed nightmares with a healthcare provider, as well as possible explanations for low rates of nightmare complaints.; Methods: The present study utilized a large United States community sample recruited through mTurk and a student sample recruited from a large public university in the Southeast United States. In Study 1, participants (n = 809) were asked whether they had discussed nightmares with a healthcare provider. In Study 2 participants (n = 747) were asked whether they believed nightmares were treatable in addition to whether or not they had discussed nightmares with a healthcare provider.; Results: Of the participants in Study 1 experiencing clinically significant nightmare symptoms only 37.8% of participants reported discussing their nightmares with a healthcare professional. In Study 2 only 11.1% of participants with significant nightmares reporting having told a healthcare provider about their nightmares. Further, of these individuals with clinically significant nightmare symptoms, less than one-third believed that nightmares were treatable. Higher nightmare severity was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting nightmares to a healthcare physician as well as with lower beliefs that nightmares are treatable.; Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nightmares are rarely reported to healthcare providers, which may explain the underutilization of nightmare treatments.

For women, there was both a direct effect of alcohol use on suicide risk as well as an indirect effect of alcohol use through insomnia symptoms increasing suicide risk. For men, there was no direct effect of alcohol use on suicide risk, but there was a significant indirect effect of alcohol use increasing suicide risk through insomnia symptoms.

990,Treatment options for the management of pervasive developmental disorders,"Autism spectrum disorder (previously known as pervasive developmental disorders) is characterized by social communication deficits, impaired functioning, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors and interests. Patients with autism spectrum disorder also commonly experience core maladaptive behaviors such as aggression and irritability, self-injurious behaviors, hyperactivity, and sleep abnormalities. These behaviors may be sources of stress for caregivers and patients alike and may require pharmacologic management. Risperidone and aripiprazole are frequently used to treat both irritability and self-injurious behavior related to autism spectrum disorder. The opioid antagonist naltrexone has also been studied for self-injurious behaviors, although long-term data are lacking when used in the autism spectrum disorder population. Methylphenidate, atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine are all potential options for the treatment of hyperactivity or attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms in patients with autism spectrum disorder. Lastly, melatonin is the most widely researched medication strategy for the management of sleep disorders in autism spectrum disorder. Future studies reviewing new pharmacologic treatment approaches in combination with non-pharmacologic therapies are warranted to ensure that target behaviors of autism spectrum disorder are appropriately managed.

992,Circadian malfunctions in depression - neurobiological and psychosocial approaches,"Depression leads to disturbances in physiological rhythms, which result in disturbances in circadian sleep-wake cycles, hormonal secretion patterns and fluctuations in mood, all of which can be objectively measured. These disturbances, which are associated with depression, can be also used to define depression. Beyond these transversal"" time-related symptoms there are the ""longitudinal"" time-related symptoms since depression evolves over a long period of time with a profound impact on a person's life and is often associated with long-term psychosocial consequences (Mendlewicz 2010). The circadian rhythm reflects an approximate 24-hour cycle in the biochemical physiological and behavioral processes of living entities which crucially influences human well-being and health. Increasing evidence from clinical and neurobiological research suggests that disrupted temporal organization impairs behavior cognition mood sleep and social activity and may be implicated in mental disorders. It has been proposed that circadian malfunction is a major core feature of mood disorders depression in particular. In depressed patients circadian rhythms and homeostatic processes are disrupted thereby affecting mood sleep activity and a variety of biological functions such as hormone secretion and body temperature (Hajak & Landgrebe 2010). Sleep difficulties are among the most current symptoms in depressed patients. Insomnia is often the reason why depressed patients seek help and relief of sleep disturbance may encourage compliance with antidepressant treatment.

993,Nedley Depression Hit Hypothesis: Identifying Depression and Its Causes,"Depression is often diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. We propose how certain lifestyle choices and non-modifiable factors can predict the development of depression. We identified 10 cause categories (hits or blows"" to the brain) and theorize that four or more active hits could trigger a depression episode. Methods. A sample of 4271 participants from our community-based program (70% female; ages 17-94 years) was assessed at baseline and at the eighth week of the program using a custom test. Ten cause categories were examined as predictors of depression are (1) Genetic (2)Developmental (3)Lifestyle (4)Circadian Rhythm (5)Addiction (6)Nutrition (7)Toxic (8)Social/Complicated Grief (9)Medical Condition and (10)Frontal Lobe. Results. The relationship between the DSM-5 score and a person having four hits categories in the first program week showed a sensitivity of 89.98 % (95% CI: 89.20 % - 90.73%) specificity 48.84% (CI 45.94-51.75) and Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) .41 . For the eight-week test the results showed a sensitivity 83.6% (CI 81.9-85.5) specificity 53.7% (CI 51.7-55.6) and MCC .38. Overall the hits that improved the most from baseline after the eighth week were: Nutrition (47%) Frontal lobe (36%) Addiction (24%) Social (12%) and Medical (10%). Conclusions. The Nedley four-hit hypothesis seems to predict a depressive episode and correlates well with the DSM-5 criteria with good sensitivity and MCC but less specificity. Identifying these factors and applying lifestyle therapies could play an important role in the treatment of depressed individuals.; ""anxiety, depression, emotional-intelligence, lifestyle, risks","Nedley, Neil & Ramirez, Francisco E.",1,993
994,Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT) for the prevention of suicide in military personnel with histories of trauma: Treatment development and case example,"To date, no inpatient evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions have been developed for suicidal individuals with psychological trauma. Therefore, we have adapted, refined, implemented, and pilot-tested an inpatient-based cognitive behavioral therapy protocol, named Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT), for the prevention of suicide. This article briefly describes the theoretical and research underpinnings for PACT, components of the treatment protocol, and clinical challenges. A case study of a traumatized military service member hospitalized following a suicide attempt is presented. Baseline and follow-up assessment data show general improvements in suicide ideation, depression, hopelessness, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptomatology over time. While the data for the presented case appears promising, the efficacy of PACT remains unknown and is currently under investigation in a randomized controlled trial. Recommendations for clinicians and students who deliver care to suicidal psychiatric inpatients are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

995,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor poisoning: An evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management,"A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 48,000 exposures to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected ingestion of an SSRI by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of an SSRI might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of SSRI ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of immediate-release forms of SSRIs alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances might require different referral and management recommendations depending on their combined toxicities. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department. This activity should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) Any patient already experiencing any symptoms other than mild effects (mild effects include vomiting, somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch], mydriasis, or diaphoresis) should be transported to an emergency department. Transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 3) Asymptomatic patients or those with mild effects (defined above) following isolated unintentional acute SSRI ingestions of up to five times an initial adult therapeutic dose (i.e., citalopram 100 mg, escitalopram 50 mg, fluoxetine 100 mg, fluvoxamine 250 mg, paroxetine 100 mg, sertraline 250 mg) can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop. For patients already on an SSRI, those with ingestion of up to five times their own single therapeutic dose can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) The poison center should consider making follow-up calls during the first 8 hours after ingestion, following its normal procedure. Consideration should be given to the time of day when home observation will take place. Observation during normal sleep hours might not reliably identify the onset of toxicity. Depending on local poison center policy, patients could be referred to an emergency department if the observation would take place during normal sleeping hours of the patient or caretaker (Grade D). 5) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 6) The use of oral activated charcoal can be considered since the likelihood of SSRI-induced loss of consciousness or seizures is small. However, there are no data to suggest a specific clinical benefit. The routine use of out-of-hospital oral activated charcoal in patients with unintentional SSRI overdose cannot be advocated at this time (Grade C). 7) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (>104 degrees F [>40 degrees C]) for SSRI-induced serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C).;Ambulatory Care*, Emergency Medical Services/*standards, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*poisoning, Adult, Age Factors, Child, Preschool, Drug Overdose, Evidence-Based Medicine, Humans, Serotonin Syndrome/therapy, Suicide/psychology, Suicide, Attempted/psychology, Terminology as Topic, Triage","Nelson, Lewis S; Erdman, Andrew R; Booze, Lisa L; Cobaugh, Daniel J; Chyka, Peter A; Woolf, Alan D; Scharman, Elizabeth J; Wax, Paul M; Manoguerra, Anthony S; Christianson, Gwenn; Caravati, E Martin & Troutman, William G",0,995
996,Suicide and the elderly,"The article discuses about the Suicide and the elderly.Public awareness of suicide has increased dramatically in recent times another segment of our society equally predisposed toward suicidal behavior is the elderly. Even though suicide among the elderly 'only' represents the 9th or 10th leading cause of death among those aged over 65, the problem still deserves our attention. In fact, many suicide deaths among the elderly are still being recorded as deaths due to other causes. Two of the most important contributing factors to suicide in the elderly are depression and alcoholism. Depression is frequently seen as a factor in the link between mental disorders and suicide. Among the elderly, researchers believe that depression underlies two-thirds of the suicides. Key symptoms that indicate a high risk for suicide include persistent insomnia, marked feelings of guilt and inadequacy, hypochondriac delirium and agitation. Elderly persons typically display fewer suicidal warnings signs that other age groups, and it often can be difficult to ascertain whether the signals you are receiving are in fact signs of suicidal intention. It is important to act upon your beliefs and discuss with the elderly person if, in fact, suicide is being contemplated.

997,Aerobic exercise program with or without motor complexity as an add-on to the pharmacological treatment of depression - study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Patients with major depression disorder presents increased rates of cognitive decline, reduced hippocampal volume, poor sleep quality, hypertension, obesity, suicidal ideation and behavior, and decreased functionality. Although continuous aerobic exercise (CAE) improves some of the aforementioned symptoms, comorbidities, and conditions, recent studies have suggested that performing aerobic exercise with motor complexity (AEMC) may be more beneficial for cognitive decline, hippocampal volume, and functionality. Therefore, this randomized controlled trial will compare the effects of CAE and AEMC on depression score, cognitive function, hippocampal volume, brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, sleep parameters, cardiovascular risk parameters, suicidal behavior, functionality, and treatment costs in patients with depression.; Methods/design: Seventy-five medicated patients with depression will be recruited from a Basic Healthcare Unit to participate in this prospective, parallel group, single blinded, superiority, randomized controlled trial. Patients with depression according to DSM-V criteria will be balanced and randomly assigned (based on depression scores and number of depressive episodes) to a non-exercising control (C), CAE, and AEMC groups. The CAE and AEMC groups will exercise for 60Â min, twice a week for 24Â weeks (on non-consecutive days). Exercise intensity will be maintained between 12 and 14 points of the rating of perceived exertion scale (~â€‰70-80% of the maximum heart rate). The CAE group will perform a continuous aerobic exercise while the AEMC group will perform exercises with progressively increased motor complexity. Blinded raters will assess patients before and after the intervention period. The primary outcome measure will be the change in depression score measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes will include measures of cognitive function, hippocampal volume, brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, sleep parameters, cardiovascular risk parameters, suicidal behavior, functionality, and treatment costs.; Discussion: This study was selected in the call of public policy programs for the Brazilian Unified National Health System - PPSUS 2015"". To our knowledge this is the first pragmatic trial to test the effect of adding AEMC to the pharmacological treatment of patients with depression and to evaluate the possible reductions in depression symptoms and healthcare costs.; Trial Registration: Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (ReBec) - RBR-9zgxzd - Registered onÂ 4 Jan. 2017.; ""Motor Activity*, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*therapy, Exercise Therapy/*methods, Brazil, Combined Modality Therapy, Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major/physiopathology, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Equivalence Trials as Topic, Humans, Pragmatic Clinical Trials as Topic, Prospective Studies, Single-Blind Method, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Brain volume, Cardiovascular, Clinical trial, Cognitive function, Coordinative exercise, Depression, Metabolic syndrome, Neuroplasticity, Physical activity level","Neves, Lucas Melo; Silva-Batista, Carla; Marquesini, Raquel; da Cunha, Telma FÃ¡tima; Dimateo, Elisa; Nascimento, Luciana; Moreira-Neto, AcÃ¡cio; de Lima Miliatto, Angelo CorrÃªa; das Chagas Mendes, Sheila; Saad, Flavia; Codogno, Jamile Sanches; Nunes, Renato Hoffmann; Ritti-Dias, Raphael Mendes; Juday, Valeria; Lafer, Beny & Ugrinowitsch, Carlos",0,997

It is not surprising then that many chronic pain sufferers find themselves at a point of emotional fragility where they experience thoughts of ending their life. Suicidal behavior encompasses a spectrum of experience, from life weariness"" or passive suicidal ideation to more active suicidal intent and suicide completion. A range of risk factors for suicidal behavior in the general population have been identified and these apply equally to the chronic pain population: a family history of mental illness past history of suicide attempts and the presence of comorbid depression. With regard specifically to chronic pain patients elevated suicide risk is also associated with severe or recurrent headache ambiguous diagnoses (psychogenic pain abdominal pain) and medicolegal issues related to the pain.

1000,Precision medicine for suicidality: from universality to subtypes and personalization,"Suicide remains a clear, present and increasing public health problem, despite being a potentially preventable tragedy. Its incidence is particularly high in people with overt or un(der)diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Objective and precise identification of individuals at risk, ways of monitoring response to treatments and novel preventive therapeutics need to be discovered, employed and widely deployed. We sought to investigate whether blood gene expression biomarkers for suicide (that is, a 'liquid biopsy' approach) can be identified that are more universal in nature, working across psychiatric diagnoses and genders, using larger cohorts than in previous studies. Such markers may reflect and/or be a proxy for the core biology of suicide. We were successful in this endeavor, using a comprehensive stepwise approach, leading to a wealth of findings. Steps 1, 2 and 3 were discovery, prioritization and validation for tracking suicidality, resulting in a Top Dozen list of candidate biomarkers comprising the top biomarkers from each step, as well as a larger list of 148 candidate biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction in the validation step. Step 4 was testing the Top Dozen list and Bonferroni biomarker list for predictive ability for suicidal ideation (SI) and for future hospitalizations for suicidality in independent cohorts, leading to the identification of completely novel predictive biomarkers (such as CLN5 and AK2), as well as reinforcement of ours and others previous findings in the field (such as SLC4A4 and SKA2). Additionally, we examined whether subtypes of suicidality can be identified based on mental state at the time of high SI and identified four potential subtypes: high anxiety, low mood, combined and non-affective (psychotic). Such subtypes may delineate groups of individuals that are more homogenous in terms of suicidality biology and behavior. We also studied a more personalized approach, by psychiatric diagnosis and gender, with a focus on bipolar males, the highest risk group. Such a personalized approach may be more sensitive to gender differences and to the impact of psychiatric co-morbidities and medications. We compared testing the universal biomarkers in everybody versus testing by subtypes versus personalized by gender and diagnosis, and show that the subtype and personalized approaches permit enhanced precision of predictions for different universal biomarkers. In particular, LHFP appears to be a strong predictor for suicidality in males with depression. We also directly examined whether biomarkers discovered using male bipolars only are better predictors in a male bipolar independent cohort than universal biomarkers and show evidence for a possible advantage of personalization. We identified completely novel biomarkers (such as SPTBN1 and C7orf73), and reinforced previously known biomarkers (such as PTEN and SAT1). For diagnostic ability testing purposes, we also examined as predictors phenotypic measures as apps (for suicide risk (CFI-S, Convergent Functional Information for Suicidality) and for anxiety and mood (SASS, Simplified Affective State Scale)) by themselves, as well as in combination with the top biomarkers (the combination being our a priori primary endpoint), to provide context and enhance precision of predictions. We obtained area under the curves of 90% for SI and 77% for future hospitalizations in independent cohorts. Step 5 was to look for mechanistic understanding, starting with examining evidence for the Top Dozen and Bonferroni biomarkers for involvement in other psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders, as a mechanism for biological predisposition and vulnerability. The biomarkers we identified also provide a window towards understanding the biology of suicide, implicating biological pathways related to neurogenesis, programmed cell death and insulin signaling from the universal biomarkers, as well as mTOR signaling from the male bipolar biomarkers. In particular, HTR2A increase coupled with ARRB1 and GSK3B decreases in expression in suicidality may provide a synergistic mechanistical corrective target, as do SLC4A4 increase coupled with AHCYL1 and AHCYL2 decrease. Step 6 was to move beyond diagnostics and mechanistical risk assessment, towards providing a foundation for personalized therapeutics. Items scored positive in the CFI-S and subtypes identified by SASS in different individuals provide targets for personalized (psycho)therapy. Some individual biomarkers are targets of existing drugs used to treat mood disorders and suicidality (lithium, clozapine and omega-3 fatty acids), providing a means toward pharmacogenomics stratification of patients and monitoring of response to treatment. Such biomarkers merit evaluation in clinical trials. Bioinformatics drug repurposing analyses with the gene expression biosignatures of the Top Dozen and Bonferroni-validated universal biomarkers identified novel potential therapeutics for suicidality, such as ebselen (a lithium mimetic), piracetam (a nootropic), chlorogenic acid (a polyphenol) and metformin (an antidiabetic and possible longevity promoting drug). Finally, based on the totality of our data and of the evidence in the field to date, a convergent functional evidence score prioritizing biomarkers that have all around evidence (track suicidality, predict it, are reflective of biological predisposition and are potential drug targets) brought to the fore APOE and IL6 from among the universal biomarkers, suggesting an inflammatory/accelerated aging component that may be a targetable common denominator.; Precision Medicine/*methods, Risk Assessment/*methods, Suicide/*psychology, Adult, Anxiety Disorders/psychology, Biomarkers/blood, Bipolar Disorder/psychology, Depression/psychology, Female, Gene Expression/genetics, Genomics/methods, Humans, Male, Risk Factors, Suicidal Ideation, Suicide/prevention & control, Suicide, Attempted/psychology","Niculescu, A.

Outcome was assessed by use of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale and by the need for additional medication and for hospital and outpatient care. An increase in psychopathology in a significant number of Ss was attributed to an increase in depressive symptoms and in fatigability, pessimistic thoughts, reduced sleep, and inner tension. Suicidal thoughts were common, but no significant progression was demonstrated. Factors that showed a significant relationship with increases in depressive symptoms included serum lithium levels and lithium elimination, low levels of social functioning, and the need for combined administration of antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

1003,Hospitalization and suicide,"In the medico-surgical wards of general hospitals, admitted patients encounter many elements, potentially leading to a prosuicidal state. First, medical illnesses directly affect risk, and are often associated with pain and sleep impairment, which are independent risk factors. Many patients are being told about the results of tests suggesting a malignant course and that is where treatment of last resort fails. In addition to stress as a trigger, hopelessness, helplessness, as well as a marked diminution of abilities, functioning and self worth occurs. Medications themselves may induce depression, anxiety or may have been associated with suicidality. The non-psychiatric hospital environment diminishes access to social support, (which that may have balanced the increased risk in the outpatient), and provides access to lethal means to commit suicide, such as jumping from heights, hanging, sharp objects and medications. Open access allows patients to sometime leave the hospital to complete suicide. In addition to depression, alcohol intoxication on admission and alcohol abuse, a more severe medical illness, past suicide attempts, older age and male gender represent specific risk factors. This paper presents an abbreviated review of the literature and makes recommendations at multiple levels- administrative, clinical and educational. Considering that many suicide attempts in the nonpsychiatric milieu are impulsive, difficult to predict, and serious, we believe that in the long run developing and testing a suicide related vital sign (e.g. a psychological pain scale administered simultaneously with the physical pain scale) will contribute to early detection and better monitoring of suicide risk. We recommend a team approach with a psychiatrist, somatic physician, nursing staff, social worker, often a pastoral counselor or chaplain, in close contact with the patient and a close relative or significant other, along with administrative efforts for suicide education and reducing access to lethal means, as an effective way to reduce suicide risk in general hospitals.

The nocturnal sleep duration increased from <4 to 7 hours (median values) nonopioid analgesic and sedative daily consumption became approximately two times lower whereas the gait ability and ambulation patterns remained practically unchanged. Five patients still had ongoing treatment after durations of 30 to 1707 (median 206) days at the close of the study.

1005,Exploratory analyses of effect modifiers in the antidepressant treatment of major depression: Individual-participant data meta-analysis of 2803 participants in seven placebo-controlled randomized trials,"It is clinically important to know who are likely to respond more or less to antidepressants. However, meaningful effect modifiers (variables associated with differential response depending on the treatment) are yet to be identified.Methods: We conducted individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis and meta-regression to explore effect modifiers in placebo-controlled antidepressant trials conducted so far in Japan.Results: We obtained access to IPD from seven placebo-controlled trials comparing bupropion, duloxetine, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine or venlafaxine with placebo in the acute phase treatment of major depression (total n = 2803). The higher the guilt subscale score of the baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the greater the difference in reduction in depression severity between the antidepressants and placebo at week 6, while the older the current age or the age at onset, the smaller the difference. At week 8, the guilt subscale score of HRSD and presence of suicidal ideation at baseline predicted greater, and the anhedonia subscale and insomnia subscale scores of HRSD and early response at week 2 predicted smaller, difference in reduction.Limitations: Different studies measured different sets of baseline variables and we were able to analyze only a limited set of candidate variables for effect modification.Conclusion: Age, age at onset, several HRSD subscales including guilt, anhedonia and insomnia, presence of suicidal ideation at baseline and early response are potential effect modifiers for response to antidepressants in the acute phase antidepressant treatment of major depression.

1006,"A prospective, longitudinal study of sleep disturbance and comorbidity in opiate dependence (the ANRS Methaville study)","Rationale/objectives: Sleep disturbance is frequent in opioid-dependent patients. To date, no data are available about the impact of methadone maintenance treatment on sleep disturbance. Using 1-year follow-up data from the Methaville trial, we investigated the impact of methadone initiation and other correlates on sleep disturbance in opioid-dependent patients. Methods: Sleep disturbance severity was evaluated using two items from different scales (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for depression and Opiate Treatment Index). We assessed the effect of methadone and other correlates on sleep disturbance severity during follow-up (months 0, 6, and 12) using a mixed multinomial logistic regression model. Results: We included 173 patients who had 1-year follow-up data on sleep disturbance, corresponding to 445 visits. At enrolment, 60.5 % reported medium to severe sleep disturbance. This proportion remained stable during methadone treatment: 54.0 % at month 6 and 55.4 % at month 12. The final multivariate model indicated that younger patients (odds ratio (OR) [95 % CI] 0.95 [0.90â€“1.00]), patients with pain (OR [95 % CI] 2.45 [1.13â€“5.32]), patients with high or very high nicotine dependence (OR [95 % CI] 5.89 [2.41â€“14.39]), and patients at suicidal risk (2.50 [1.13â€“5.52]) had a higher risk of severe sleep disturbance. Because of collinearity between suicidal risk and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, ADHD was not associated with sleep disturbance in the final model. Receiving methadone treatment had no significant effect on sleep disturbance. Conclusions: Sleep disturbance is frequent among opioid-dependent patients. It can be regarded as an important signal of more complex psychiatric comorbidities such as suicidal risk and ADHD. However, sleep disturbance should not be considered an obstacle to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) initiation or continuation.

1007,Sleep disturbances and suicidality: a common association to look for in clinical practise and preventive care,"Suicidality and suicide has been associated with many risk factors, while recent clinical and epidemiological studies increasingly point to a potential link between sleep loss or sleep disturbances and suicidality. This review on studies of sleep disturbances associated with suicidality, i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide suggests a frequent association especially with insomnia and nightmares but also hypersomnia and sleep panic attacks. In suicidal insomniacs with comorbid psychiatric disorders, there is some evidence for an even independent predictive nature of sleep problems for suicidality. Considerations on the shared neurobiology, risk assessment and treatment options complement the overview. Thus, sleep disturbances may qualify as an individual treatable target of personalised medicine in the clinical routine as well as in suicide prevention programmes. A more detailed assessment of sleep problems and identification of specific risk domains in primary or secondary prevention of suicidality seem to be a future area of high importance.; ","Norra, Christine; Richter, Nadja & Juckel, Georg",0,1007
1008,Specific depressive symptoms and disorders as associates and predictors of suicidal acts across adolescence,"Objective: To examine the role of depressive symptoms and disorders as associates and predictors of suicidal acts across adolescence. Method: A representative sample of Norwegian school students (N = 2464, mean age 13.7 years) in grades 8 and 9 was reassessed after one year (T2) with the same questionnaire. All high scorers of depressive symptoms on the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) at T2 were defined as cases. One control from low or middle scorers, matched for age and gender, was randomly assigned to every two cases. This subset (n = 345) was diagnostically assessed by face-to-face K-SADS-PL interviews (mean age = 14.9 years). The same subset was reassessed after 5 years (T3) by using the same questionnaire (n = 252, mean age = 20.0 years) and telephone K-SADS-PL interviews (n = 242). The participation rate was 76.9% (n = 265). Results: Cognitive symptoms dominated the depressive symptom profile among suicide attempters, irrespective of age and time. Among younger adolescents, suicidal thoughts and acts of self-harm without suicidal intent were associated with suicidal acts. Recurrent thoughts about death, hopelessness, disturbed concentration and middle insomnia were associates of suicidal acts among older adolescents. Worthlessness by 15 years was a significant predictor of suicidal acts between 15 to 20 years. MDD and a depressive episode, not otherwise specified, continued to be significant associates among younger adolescents, while dysthymia by 15 years remained a predictor of suicidal acts between 15 to 20 years, even when controlled for depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Self-harm without suicidal intent, middle insomnia, cognitive depressive symptoms and a formal psychiatric diagnosis of any depressive disorder should alert professionals in the risk assessment of suicidal adolescents.

1009,Life course pathways of adverse childhood experiences toward adult psychological well-being: A stress process analysis,"Growing evidence suggests that toxic stressors early in life not only convey developmental impacts but also augment risk of proliferating chains of additional stressors that can overwhelm individual coping and undermine recovery and health. Examining trauma within a life course stress process perspective, we posit that early childhood adversity carries a unique capacity to impair adult psychological well-being both independent of and cumulative with other contributors, including social disadvantage and stressful adult experiences. This study uses data from a representative population-based health survey (N=13,593) to provide one of the first multivariate assessments of unique, cumulative, and moderated effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) toward explaining 3 related yet distinct measures of adult mental health: perceived well-being, psychological distress, and impaired daily activities. Results demonstrate support for each set of hypothesized associations, including exacerbation and amelioration of ACEs effects by adult stress and resilience resources, respectively.

1010,Care of depressed patients with anxiety symptoms,"Anxiety frequently coexists with depression, either as a comorbid anxiety disorder or as anxiety symptoms accompanying a primary depressive disorder. Effective therapy for the treatment of depressive illness must include a consideration of anxiety symptoms, since anxiety has been estimated to be present in up to 96% of patients with depressive illness. Available data also indicate that depressed patients with significant anxiety may be at greater risk for suicide. Of particular clinical importance are symptoms of somatic anxiety: they are present in up to 86% of depressed patients, and the failure to treat them effectively can diminish the ability of a patient to function. Since the overall prognosis for recovery from a major depressive episode is less than optimal in patients with significant anxiety, treatments that can provide an effective and early relief of both depressive and anxiety symptoms are of paramount importance. Drugs with serotonin reuptake inhibition (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]) may produce transient increases in anxiety symptomatology presenting as jitteriness, agitation, insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms when treatment is initiated. Mirtazapine has intrinsic receptor-blocking properties (in particular, serotonin-2 [5-HT2] receptor blockade) that can be linked to an early relief of anxiety symptoms during the treatment. The available data show that mirtazapine is superior to placebo in depressed patients with high baseline anxiety and/or agitation. Furthermore, mirtazapine was statistically significantly superior to both citalopram and paroxetine in alleviating anxiety symptoms early in treatment as assessed by changes from baseline on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression anxiety/somatization factor, respectively. Mirtazapine provides early and effective relief of both depressive and anxiety symptoms, reducing the need for polypharmacy. These therapeutic actions of mirtazapine persist throughout the course of treatment.;Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Mianserin/*analogs & derivatives, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology, Anxiety Disorders/psychology, Citalopram/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Comorbidity, Depressive Disorder/epidemiology, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Fluoxetine/therapeutic use, Humans, Mianserin/therapeutic use, Paroxetine/therapeutic use, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome","Nutt, D J",0,1010
1011,Sleep disorders as core symptoms of depression,"Links between sleep and depression are strong. About three quarters of depressed patients have insomnia symptoms, and hypersomnia is present in about 40% of young depressed adults and 10% of older patients, with a preponderance in females. The symptoms cause huge distress, have a major impact on quality of life, and are a strong risk factor for suicide. As well as the subjective experience of sleep symptoms, there are well-documented changes in objective sleep architecture in depression. Mechanisms of sleep regulation and how they might be disturbed in depression are discussed. The sleep symptoms are often unresolved by treatment, and confer a greater risk of relapse and recurrence. Epidemiological studies have pointed out that insomnia in nondepressed subjects is a risk factor for later development of depression. There is therefore a need for more successful management of sleep disturbance in depression, in order to improve quality of life in these patients and reduce an important factor in depressive relapse and recurrence.;Depression/*complications, Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic/*etiology, Depression/physiopathology, Humans, Incidence, Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic/epidemiology","Nutt, David; Wilson, Sue & Paterson, Louise",0,1011

Results show that approximately 67% of Ss with a mild depressive episode reported 1+ symptoms to their GP. As well, nearly half of Ss with moderate depressive episodes and 75% of Ss with severe depressive illness reported 1+ symptoms to their GP. 47.6% of Ss with moderate or severe depressive illness did not inform their GP of any depressive symptoms.

GPs rated Ss' current mental state and cognitive functioning, and completed interviews concerning knowledge of patients' symptoms, sources of information, practical responses to patients' and caregivers' concerns, psychotropic medications prescribed, and likely actions if patients' conditions worsened. Results show that GPs' assessments of Ss' mood concurred with research diagnoses in 66% of cases of mild depressive episode and 88% of cases of moderate or severe depressive episode. As well, GPs most frequently diagnosed depression among Ss having previous contact with a psychiatrist, or who were not considered demented.

1014,The integrated motivational-volitional model of suicidal behaviour,"Suicide is a major public health concern accounting for 800 000 deaths globally each year. Although there have been many advances in understanding suicide risk in recent decades, our ability to predict suicide is no better now than it was 50 years ago. There are many potential explanations for this lack of progress, but the absence, until recently, of comprehensive theoretical models that predict the emergence of suicidal ideation distinct from the transition between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts/suicide is key to this lack of progress. The current article presents the integrated motivational-volitional (IMV) model of suicidal behaviour, one such theoretical model. We propose that defeat and entrapment drive the emergence of suicidal ideation and that a group of factors, entitled volitional moderators (VMs), govern the transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviour. According to the IMV model, VMs include access to the means of suicide, exposure to suicidal behaviour, capability for suicide (fearlessness about death and increased physical pain tolerance), planning, impulsivity, mental imagery and past suicidal behaviour. In this article, we describe the theoretical origins of the IMV model, the key premises underpinning the model, empirical tests of the model and future research directions.This article is part of the theme issue 'Evolutionary thanatology: impacts of the dead on the living in humans and other animals'.; Â© 2018 The Authors.evolutionary, psychology, risk factors, suicide, theory","O'Connor, Rory C. & Kirtley, Olivia J.",1,1014
1015,"Relative impact of risk factors, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness on suicidal ideation in veteran service members","Objective: We tested the associations between individualized risk factors, empirically validated constructs specific to suicide risk (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, and two methods for conceptualizing suicidal ideation based on Suicide Index Score (SIS) and overall severity score of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation [BSS]). Method: The current study included a sample of 134 suicidal Veterans who were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit of a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants completed the BSS, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Outcome Questionnaire- 45.2, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, Drug Abuse Screening Test, and abbreviated versions of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) and Insomnia Severity Index. We used ordinary least squares regression with bootstrapping to conduct analyses due to the skewed distributions observed in the suicidal ideation outcomes. Results: Thwarted belongingness was the only statistically significant correlate of the SIS, indicating a stronger desire to be dead than alive as Veterans perceived themselves as being increasingly disconnected and isolated from others (B = 0.36, standard error [SE] = 0.01, p = 0.005). In contrast, greater overall severity scores on the BSS were associated with higher ratings on the PCL-M (B = 0.21, SE = 0.07, p = 0.02) and for thwarted belongingness (B = 0.27, SE = 0.09, p = 0.04). Problematic alcohol use was significantly associated with lower overall severity scores (B = âˆ’.27, SE = 1.17, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Findings may inform clinical strategies for conceptualizing and targeting factors associated with suicidal risk.

1016,Anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns predict suicide risk,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns, which reflects fears of mental incapacitation, have been previously associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. The first study aim was to replicate and extend upon previous research by investigating whether AS cognitive concerns can discriminate between those at low risk versus high risk for suicidal behavior. Secondly, we aimed to test the incremental predictive power of AS cognitive concerns above and beyond known suicide risk factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness and insomnia). The sample consisted of 106 individuals (75% meeting current criteria for an Axis I disorder) recruited from the community. Results revealed that AS cognitive concerns were a robust predictor of elevated suicide risk after covarying for negative affect, whereas AS social and physical concerns were not. Those with high, relative to low, AS cognitive scores were 3.67 times more likely to be in the high suicide risk group. Moreover, AS cognitive concerns significantly predicted elevated suicide risk above and beyond relevant suicide risk factors. Results of this study add to a growing body of the literature demonstrating a relationship between AS cognitive concerns and increased suicidality. Incorporating AS cognitive concerns amelioration protocols into existing interventions for suicidal behavior may be beneficial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1017,Church-Based Sleep Screenings to Detect Mental Health Problems Among Korean-Americans,"Korean-American mental health is poorly understood, and screening for sleep disturbances may be an effective means of identifying at-risk individuals. In partnership with a Korean-American church in Los Angeles, an online survey was administered. The study was conducted at a Korean-American church in Los Angeles, California. The sample consisted of 137 Korean-Americans drawn from the church congregation. Sleep disturbances were measured using a single ordinal variable, and mental health outcomes included nonspecific psychological distress, perceived stress, loneliness, suicidal ideation, hazardous drinking, treatment seeking behaviors, and perceived need for help. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between sleep disturbances and mental health outcomes, adjusting for age and sex. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. Almost a third of the sample reported moderate or severe sleep disturbances. After adjusting for age and sex, sleep disturbances were associated with greater odds of reporting probable mental illness, perceived need for treatment, and treatment-seeking behaviors. Sleep disturbances were also associated with higher levels of perceived stress and loneliness, but were not significantly associated with suicidal ideation or hazardous drinking. Sleep disturbances are associated with mental health problems and may be an important idiom of distress for Korean-Americans. Primary care providers and informal providers in the community (specifically churches) should work together to screen for sleep problems and refer at-risk individuals to appropriate levels of care.; Churches, Korean-Americans, Mental health, Screenings, Sleep disturbances","Oh, Hans; Ko, Justine & Waldman, Kyle",1,1017
1018,Psychotic experiences and disability: Findings from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys,"Psychotic experiences are associated with a number of poor clinical outcomes, including multimorbid psychopathology, suicidal behavior, and poor treatment response. We wished to investigate the relationship between psychotic experiences and disability, including the following domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, social interaction, role functioning, and days out of role. We used three nationally representative and racially/ethnically diverse samples of the general US adult population: the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the National Latino and Asian American Survey (NLAAS), and the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). Multi-variable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between lifetime psychotic experiences (visual and auditory hallucinatory experiences and delusional ideation; WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview psychosis screen) and 30-day impairments in functioning across disability domains (using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II). In all three samples, models were adjusted for socio-demographics and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. In the NCS-R, models were also adjusted for chronic health conditions. Across all three studies, our adjusted models showed that people with disability had anywhere from about 1.5 to over 3 times the odds of reporting lifetime psychotic experiences, depending on the domain. This was true for each disability domain, except self-care in the NLAAS and in the NSAL. Psychotic experiences are markers of risk for disability across a wide range of domains. This may explain the elevated rates of service utilization among individuals who report psychotic experiences and supports the need to assess for and respond to psychotic experiences even in the absence of psychotic disorder.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Crisis hotline counselors must be able to identify high-risk callers in order to provide appropriate support. This study investigated the characteristics of Japanese crisis hotline callers in 2012 (NÂ =Â 541,694) and is the first to analyze crisis hotline data for all parts of Japan over 1Â year. About 14% of the callers had suicidal ideation and 6% had a history of attempted suicide. The odds ratio for suicidal ideation among those with a history of attempted suicide was 15.5. The suicidal ideation rate was much smaller compared to previous studies in other countries. There is a psychological barrier that must be broken for high-risk people to use support hotlines. In addition, attempted suicide is a strong exclusive predisposing factor for death due to suicide; therefore, counselors should pay careful attention to callers with a history of attempted suicide.

1020,The investigation of factors related to suicide attempts in Southeastern Turkey,"Background: Suicide is an important health problem in Turkey as it is in all regions of the world. Suicidal behavior has multiple causes, which are broadly divided into those related to proximal stressors and those due to predisposition. Suicide statistics may be associated with mental health disorders, which are among the foremost predictors of suicide attempts. More than 90% of patients who commit suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, usually a major depressive disorder. Other major risk factors for suicide attempts are history of suicide attempts in the family, stressful life events, sleep disturbances, poor income, unemployment, severity of symptoms of depression, and anxiety. Sleep is a complex phenomenon. Sleep disturbances can therefore be contributed to the emergence of suicidal behavior allowing for the possibility of predicting future suicides.; Methods: We evaluated 106 patients who were admitted after suicide attempts to the Department of Psychiatry at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine. The recruited subjects were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, and the intensity of symptoms was evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The mean values of the subjects attempting multiple and single suicides were compared using appropriate inferential statistical tests.; Results: Most suicide attempts are believed to be preventable. Our results revealed that a great variety of risk factors are associated with an increased risk for multiple suicide attempts. Most of these attempts appeared to be spontaneous and impulsive rather than planned. In particular, this study highlights the importance of previous suicide attempts, history of suicide in the family, history of stressful life events in the previous 6 months, poor income, unemployment, sleep disturbances, severe hopelessness with depression, and coexisting symptoms of anxiety as risk factors.; Conclusion: The first step in prevention of suicides is doubtlessly strong and reliable communication, due to the fact that the majority of subjects who commit suicide have had contact with a health professional during the month before the suicide.; comorbidity, mental health, sleep disturbances, sociodemographics, suicide, suicide attempt","Okan Ibiloglu, Aslihan; Atli, Abdullah; Demir, Suleyman; Gunes, Mehmet; Kaya, Mehmet Cemal; Bulut, Mahmut & Sir, Aytekin",1,1020
1021,Two depression rating instruments in Nigerian patients,"Having been developed in a foreign culture, the extent to which items on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Zung Self-Rating Scale (ZS) reflect the features of depression as obtained in clinical interviews in Nigeria is uncertain. Also, items predictive capabilities for the severity of depression and the extent of concurrence between the two scales in assessing depression need to be ascertained. Seventy- eight patients who met the ICD 10 criteria for major depressive disorder completed the ZS and had the HDRS completed on them. These patients, (in addition to six others) had their case records examined and their symptoms of depression extracted. The predictive values of each item on the scales to the overall severity of depression, the intra-scale and inter-scale items correlations were calculated. Sleeplessness, somatic symptoms and sad mood were the commonest symptoms reported by patients with major depressive disorder. The Zung Scale showed that joylessness, lack of clarity of the mind, and difficulty taking decisions were also very common. The HDRS had better access to somatic symptoms than the Zung Scale, although items on the Zung Scale generally had better predictive value of the overall severity of depression than items on the HDRS. The HDRS had a moderate inter-scale correlation (r=0.43) relative to the Zung Scale, but only three equivalent items (depressed mood, suicide and impaired appetite) on the two scales had moderate and significant correlations. The HDRS and the ZS are very useful rating scales in depression but some modifications and additions will make them more applicable.; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales*, Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/*psychology, Adult, Demography, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nigeria, Predictive Value of Tests, Reproducibility of Results, Severity of Illness Index, Socioeconomic Factors","Okulate, G.

This study investigated the reliability and validity of one of the most frequently used measures of depression, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) in 422 patients with terminal cancer admitted to a palliative care hospital. The HAM-D demonstrated high reliability and concurrent validity with depression diagnosis, based on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, non-patient research version (SCID-I/NP Depression Module). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses generated an area under the curve of .91, indicating high sensitivity and specificity. The HAM-D strongly correlated with several measures of distress (e.g., hopelessness, desire for hastened death, and suicidal ideation). Factor analysis generated 4 factors (anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, and somatic symptoms), accounting for 42% of the variance.

The literature clearly documents that closely related and often co-occurring problems for patients with PTSD are major depressive disorder and suicidal behavior. Some authors also report an evaluation of patients in an emergency department who attempted suicide, and they found that the patients were persistently suicidal after surviving the attempt. They argue in favor of using standardized assessment of suicidal behavior and risk in such patients.

Univariate and multivariate comparisons were performed between the subgroups with and without psychomotor agitation (OPCRIT item 23 â‰¥ 1). Agitated depression (AD, a major depressive episode with psychomotor agitation) was present in 19% of the sample. Compared to nonagitated counterparts, patients with AD were older and had lower educational levels and more dysphoria, insomnia, positive thought disorder, and psychotic manifestations. Hypomanic symptoms other than agitation were relatively uncommon (< 10%) and more represented in subjects with AD. No significant differences emerged between AD and control groups with respect to most bipolar validators (gender, familiarity, recurrence). Patients with AD had higher levels of suicidal ideation than non-AD controls; however, such a difference was no longer significant after controlling for psychotic features. Excessive self-reproach, early awakening, diurnal changes, poor appetite, and hypomanic symptoms were independently associated with suicidal thoughts in nonpsychotic MDD. Incomplete information on drug treatment, exclusion of patients with Axis I comorbidity, and tertiary care setting were the most important limitations of the study. Although we failed to support the bipolar nature of MDD-AD by common validators, probably because we used a more heterogeneous definition of agitation compared to similar studies, our data confirm the association of agitation with hypomanic symptoms and suicidal thoughts in major depression, and emphasize the complex phenomenology of AD in an inpatient setting.

1026,Self-injurious behaviour in Cornelia de Lange syndrome: I Prevalence and phenomenology,"Background: Self-injurious behaviour is frequently identified as part of the behavioural phenotype of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS).We conducted a case-control study of the prevalence and phenomenology of self-injurious behaviour (SIB) in CdLS. Methods: A total of 54 participants with CdLS were compared with 46 individuals who were comparable on key variables including age, degree of intellectual disability and wheelchair use, using questionnaire and observational measures. Results: Clinically significant self-injury was not more prevalent in the CdLS group (55.6%), nor was it different in presentation from that seen in the comparison group. Hyperactivity, stereotyped and compulsive behaviours predicted clinically significant self-injury in all participants. Hand directed, mild self-injury was more prevalent in CdLS. Conclusions: The results show that clinically significant self-injury may not be part of the behavioural phenotype of CdLS but a specific body target for proto-SIB is more common.

1027,Self-injurious behaviour in people with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder,"Purpose of review: This review summarises the recent trends in research in the field of self-injurious behaviour in people with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Recent findings: New data on incidence, persistence and severity add to studies of prevalence to indicate the large scale of the clinical need. A number of person characteristics have been repeatedly identified in prevalence and cohort studies that: can be considered as risk markers (e.g. stereotyped behaviour, autism spectrum disorder) and indicate possible causal mechanisms (e.g. sleep disorder, anxiety). Studies have started to integrate traditional operant learning paradigms with known person characteristics and reviews and meta-analyses of applied behaviour analytic procedures can now inform practice. Summary: Despite these positive developments interventions and appropriate support falls far short of the required need. Expansions in applied research are warranted to develop and evaluate innovative service delivery models that can translate knowledge of risk markers and operant learning paradigms into widespread, low cost routine clinical practice. Alongside this, further pure research is needed to elucidate the direction of causality of implicated risk factors, in order to understand and intervene more effectively in self-injury.

1028,The right of individuals with mental illness to keep and bear arms,"The article presents the case of Tyler v. Hillsdale County Sheriffâ€™s Department, 775 F.3d 308 (6th Cir. 2014), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the United States District Court for the Western District of Michiganâ€™s decision to dismiss a claim by Clifford Charles Tyler, stating that the federal statute that prohibits individuals who have been committed to a mental institution from possessing firearms was unconstitutional as applied to him. Mr. Tyler resided in Michigan, where there is no relief-from-disabilities program that would give him the opportunity to challenge prohibition of firearms for persons who have been adjudicated intellectually disabled or have been committed to a mental institution under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 922(g)(4) (2012). Mr. Tyler, now 73 years old, had been involuntarily committed in 1986 after his daughter called the police while he was having a difficult time during his divorce. At the time, he was reportedly sobbing, depressed, and suicidal, with difficulty sleeping. His family called the police and he was ultimately involuntarily committed to the Ypsilanti Regional Center. Thirty-five years later, in February 2011, Mr. Tyler attempted to buy a firearm and was informed by the Hillsdale County Sheriffâ€™s Office that he was ineligible because of his previous commitment to a mental institution, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Â§ 922(g)(4) (2012). On August 2011, he appealed the denial. In this case, the court ruled that laws imposing controls on the right to keep and bear arms must fulfill the most thorough constitutional test balanced in favor of upholding fundamental rights, and in this circuit, such a test must be judged by a strict-scrutiny analysis.

1029,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a National Football League player: Case report and emerging medicolegal practice questions,"We present a case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a retired National Football League (NFL) Player with autopsy findings, apolipoprotein E genotype, and brain tissue evidence of chronic brain damage. This 44-year-old retired NFL player manifested a premortem history of cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment, which included in part, chronic depression, suicide attempts, insomnia, paranoia, and impaired memory before he finally committed suicide. A full autopsy was performed with Polymerase Chain Reaction-based analyses of his blood to determine the apolipoprotein genotype. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on topo-graphical gross sections of the brain. Autopsy confirmed a fatal gunshot wound of the head. The apolipoprotein E genotype was E3/E3 and the brain tissue revealed diffuse cerebral tau-pathy (Neurofibrillary Tangles and Neuritic Threads). This will be the third case of CTE in a national football player, which has been reported in the medical literature. Omalu et al., reported the first two cases in 2005 and 2006. This case series manifested similar premortem history of neuropsychiatric impairment with autopsy evidence of cerebral taupathy without any neuritic amyloidopathy. For a definitive diagnosis of CTE to be made, and for medicolegal purposes, a full autopsy must be performed with histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses of the brain to identify the presence of Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs) and Neuritic Threads (NTs). Implications: Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to confirm the common denominators and epidemiology of CTE in professional American football players, which have been identified by this case series.

1030,Encountering the Body at the Site of the Suicide: A Population-Based Survey in Sweden,"Encountering the body of a child who died by suicide at the site of death is believed to be especially harmful for bereaved parents. We investigated the association between encountering the body at the site of the suicide and psychological distress in 666 suicide-bereaved parents. Parents who had encountered their child's body at the site of the suicide (nÂ =Â 147) did not have a higher risk of nightmares (relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-1.35), intrusive memories (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.13), avoidance of thoughts (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74-1.27), avoidance of places or things (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66-1.25), anxiety (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64-1.33), or depression (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.42) compared with parents who had not encountered the body (nÂ =Â 512).

1031,Viewing the body after bereavement due to suicide: a population-based survey in Sweden,"Background: Research on the assumed, positive and negative, psychological effects of viewing the body after a suicide loss is sparse. We hypothesized that suicide-bereaved parents that viewed their childs body in a formal setting seldom regretted the experience, and that viewing the body was associated with lower levels of psychological morbidity two to five years after the loss.; Methods and Findings: We identified 915 suicide-bereaved parents by linkage of nationwide population-based registries and collected data by a questionnaire. The outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). In total, 666 (73%) parents participated. Of the 460 parents (69%) that viewed the body, 96% answered that they did not regret the experience. The viewing was associated with a higher risk of reliving the child's death through nightmares (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.32) and intrusive memories (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.38), but not with anxiety (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.40) and depression (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.83). One limitation of our study is that we lack data on the informants' personality and coping strategies.; Conclusions: In this Swedish population-based survey of suicide-bereaved parents, we found that by and large everyone that had viewed their deceased child in a formal setting did not report regretting the viewing when asked two to five years after the loss. Our findings suggest that most bereaved parents are capable of deciding if they want to view the body or not. Officials may assist by giving careful information about the child's appearance and other details concerning the viewing, thus facilitating mental preparation for the bereaved person. This is the first large-scale study on the effects of viewing the body after a suicide and additional studies are needed before clinical recommendations can be made.;Bereavement*, Suicide*, Surveys and Questionnaires*, Parents/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Emotions, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychometrics, Registries, Sweden, Young Adult","Omerov, Pernilla; Steineck, Gunnar; Nyberg, Tommy; Runeson, Bo & Nyberg, Ullakarin",0,1031
1032,Neuropsychiatric safety with liraglutide 30 mg for weight management: Results from randomized controlled phase 2 and 3a trials,"Aims: Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, regulates appetite via receptors in the brain. Because of concerns regarding the potential of centrally-acting anti-obesity medications to affect mental health, pooled neuropsychiatric safety data from all phase 2 and 3a randomized, double-blind trials with liraglutide 3.0â€‰mg were evaluated post hoc.; Methods: Data from the liraglutide weight-management programme were pooled. Across trials, individuals with a body mass index â‰¥30 or â‰¥27â€‰kg/m2 with weight-related comorbidities were randomized to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3.0â€‰mg (nâ€‰=â€‰3384) or placebo (nâ€‰=â€‰1941), both with a 500â€‰kcal/d deficit diet, plus exercise. Adverse events related to neuropsychiatric safety were collected in all trials. Additionally, in the phase 3a trials, validated mental-health questionnaires were prospectively and systematically administered.; Results: In the pooled analysis of 5325 randomized and exposed individuals, rates of depression (2.1 vs 2.1 events/100 person-years) and anxiety (1.9 vs 1.7 events/100 person-years) through adverse event reporting were similarly low in liraglutide and placebo groups. Nine (0.3%) individuals receiving liraglutide and 2 (0.1%) receiving placebo reported adverse events of suicidal ideation or behaviour. In phase 3a trials, mean baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 2.8â€‰Â±â€‰3.0 vs 2.9â€‰Â±â€‰3.1 for liraglutide vs placebo improved to 1.8â€‰Â±â€‰2.7 vs 1.9â€‰Â±â€‰2.7, respectively, at treatment end; 34/3291 individuals (1.0%) receiving liraglutide 3.0â€‰mg vs 19/1843 (1.0%) receiving placebo reported suicidal ideation on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.; Conclusions: Results of this exploratory pooled analysis provide no cause for concern regarding the neuropsychiatric safety of treatment with liraglutide 3.0â€‰mg in patients similar to those included in the examined trials. Although there was a small numerical imbalance in suicidal ideation with liraglutide through adverse event reporting, no between-treatment imbalances in suicidal ideation/behaviour or depression were noted through prospective questionnaire assessments.; Â© 2017 The Authors.

1033,Mania During Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C With Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin,"In this report, we present the case of Mr. C, who developed a psychotic mania in early February 2002, after receiving pegylated IFN-Î± and ribavirin for a few weeks. This case underscores the risk for manic psychosis during interferon treatment. More important, this case illustrates the difficulties associated with completing interferon treatment after an episode of severe psychosis. Mr. C is a 39-year-old African American man with a remote history of injection drug use who was referred to the general psychiatry inpatient unit of Johns Hopkins Hospital for evaluation and treatment of psychotic mania characterized by elation, irritability, grandiosity, impulsive generosity, insomnia, hypersexuality, delusions of external control, and excessive religiousness. His medications at admission were fluoxetine, 40 mg, in the morning; pegylated IFN-Î±, 180 Î¼g once a week; ribavirin, 1200 mg once a week; and zolpidem, 10 mg at bedtime. Mr. C was offered treatment with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin despite an earlier episode of interferon-related depression and a hospitalization for suicidal depression years earlier. In Mr. C's case we note both that mania occurred during treatment with a higher potency formulation of interferon and followed an episode of interferon-induced depression by several months.

1034,Clinical characteristics of adolescents referred for treatment of depressive disorders,"Background: Adolescence is a period of increased risk for the development of depression. Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that the phenomenology of depression may differ during childhood and adolescence. However, participants in these studies may not reflect depressed young people referred to routine clinical services. The aim of this paper was to describe referrals for depression to a UK routine public healthcare service for children and adolescents with mental health difficulties. Method: This paper describes a consecutive series of adolescents (N = 100, aged 12â€“17 years), referred for depression to a routine public healthcare child and adolescent mental health service, in the south of England. Young people and their caregivers completed a structured diagnostic interview and self-report measures of anxiety and depression. Results: Fewer than half of young people referred for depression met diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. The key symptoms reported by those with depression were low mood or irritability, cognitive disturbances, sleep disturbances and negative self-perceptions. Suicidal ideation was common and was considerably higher than reported in other studies. Caregiver and young personâ€™s accounts of adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety were uncorrelated. Caregivers also reported fewer symptoms of depression in their child than adolescents themselves. Conclusions: These data have direct relevance to the design and delivery of public mental health services for children and adolescents. However, we do not know how representative this sample is of other clinical populations in the UK or in other countries. There is a need to collect routine data from other services to assess the needs of this group of high-risk adolescents.

1035,Milnacipran for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a widespread pain condition associated with fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and stiffness. Milnacipran is one of three medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States for the management of adult FMS patients. This review is the second in a three-part series reviewing each of the approved FMS drugs and serves as a primer on the use of milnacipran in FMS treatment including information on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability. Milnacipran is a mixed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor thought to improve FMS symptoms by increasing neurotransmitter levels in descending central nervous system inhibitory pathways. Milnacipran has proven efficacy in managing global FMS symptoms and pain as well as improving symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction without affecting sleep. Due to its antidepressant activity, milnacipran can also be beneficial to FMS patients with coexisting depression. However, side effects can limit milnacipran tolerability in FMS patients due to its association with headache, nausea, tachycardia, hyper- and hypotension, and increased risk for bleeding and suicidality in at-risk patients. Tolerability can be maximized by starting at low dose and slowly up-titrating if needed. As with all medications used in FMS management, milnacipran works best when used as part of an individualized treatment regimen that includes resistance and aerobic exercise, patient education and behavioral therapies.; fibromyalgia, milnacipran, treatment","Ormseth, Michelle J.; Eyler, Anne E.; Hammonds, Cara L. & Boomershine, Chad S.",0,1035
1036,Predictors of suicide ideation among older adults with bipolar disorder,"Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) carries the greatest risk of death by suicide of all psychiatric conditions as 25%-50% of those with BD will make one or more suicide attempt, and about 15% will intentionally end their lives. Among young adults with BD, substance misuse, medication non-adherence, age at onset, and comorbid psychiatric conditions each predict self-harm. It is currently unclear if these same factors or others predict suicide ideation among older adults with BD.; Methods: We recruited a global sample of 220 older adults with BD over 19 days using socio-demographically targeted, social media advertising and online data collection (Mean = 58.50, SD = 5.42; range 50 to 81 years). Path analyses allowed us to identify direct and indirect predictors of suicide ideation among older adults with BD.; Results: Cognitive failures (perception, memory, and motor function), depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, and dissatisfaction with life as direct predictors of suicide ideation; duration of BD symptoms and medication non-adherence emerged as indirect predictors. Of note, the significant impact of sleep on suicide ideation is indirect via depressive symptoms, cognitive failures, medication non-adherence and life dissatisfaction.; Conclusions: As with young adults with BD, alcohol misuse and medication non-adherence emerged as significant predictors of suicide ideation. In addition, cognitive failures directly and indirectly predict suicide ideation in this sample of older adults with BD. Population aging and treatment efficacy are leading to ever growing numbers of older adults with BD. Both direct and indirect predictors of suicide ideation need to be considered in future BD research and treatment planning.; Suicidal Ideation*, Bipolar Disorder/*psychology, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged","O'Rourke, Norm; Heisel, Marnin J.; Canham, Sarah L. & Sixsmith, Andrew",1,1036
1037,Psychometric validation of the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale (GSIS) among older adults with bipolar disorder,"Objectives: Across age groups, bipolar disorder (BD) carries the greatest risk of death by suicide of all psychiatric conditions; 25%â€“50% of those with BD will make one or more suicide attempt. Psychometrically sound instruments are required to reliably measure suicide ideation and risk of selfharm for older adults with BD. For this study, we validate the geriatric suicide ideation scale (GSIS) with adults 50 + years with BD. Methods: We recruited a global sample of 220 older adults with BD (M = 58.50 years of age) over 19 days using socio-demographically targeted, social media advertising and online data collection. To demonstrate the construct validation of GSIS responses by older adults with BD, we computed correlations and performed regression analyses to identify predictors of suicide ideation. Results: Our analyses support a four-factor model of responses to the GSIS (ideation, death ideation, loss of personal and social worth, and perceived meaning in life) measuring a higher order latent construct. Older adults with BD reporting low satisfaction with life and current depressive symptoms, and who misuse alcohol, report significantly higher levels of suicide ideation. Sleep quality and cognitive failures are also correlated with GSIS responses. Conclusions: Results support the factorial validity of the GSIS with older adults with BD. Similar to other populations, the GSIS measures a four-factor structure of suicide ideation. Across BD subtypes, the GSIS appears to reliably measure suicide ideation among older adults with BD.

1038,Premature sexual activity as an indicator of psychosocial risk,"Although unprotected premature sexual activity is associated with well-defined biologic risks of sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy, the concomitant psychosocial risks are less well documented. The strength of association (odds ratio) of coital status with other risk behaviors and feelings was examined in 1504 junior high school students. Among the 12 through 16-year-old students, 63% of the boys and 36% of the girls were nonvirginal (had had intercourse at least once). The proportion of sexually experienced boys and girls increased with age. Nonvirginal boys and girls were significantly (P less than .001) more likely than their virginal cohorts to engage in other activities considered risky. The odds ratios for nonvirginal youth ranged from 3.5 for girls having used drugs other than alcohol or marijuana, to 10.4 for girls having used marijuana. Nonvirginal boys and girls were also at significantly greater risk for engaging in minor delinquent acts and having school problems. Nonvirginal girls (but not boys) were 6.3 times more likely to report having attempted suicide. The strength of associations with feelings was weaker. Nonvirginal girls were at slightly greater risk for reporting feeling lonely, feeling upset, and having difficulty sleeping. A significant proportion of the students reported sexual experience and ever use of alcohol or marijuana (45% of boys, 27% of girls). There were strong age effects so that by age 15 years, 63% of the boys and 50% of the girls reported experience with both activities. The data suggest that early sexual experience among adolescents is associated with other potentially health-endangering behaviors and that the syndrome of problem behaviors is important in this age group.; Adolescent Behavior*, Sexual Behavior*, Adolescent, Age Factors, Alcohol Drinking, Female, Humans, Male, Marijuana Smoking, Odds Ratio, Self Concept, Sex Factors, Substance-Related Disorders, Suicide, Attempted","Orr, D.

1039,Episode forecasting in bipolar disorder: Is energy better than mood?,"Objective Bipolar disorder is a severe mood disorder characterized by alternating episodes of mania and depression. Several interventions have been developed to decrease high admission rates and high suicides rates associated with the illness, including psychoeducation and early episode detection, with mixed results. More recently, machine learning approaches have been used to aid clinical diagnosis or to detect a particular clinical state; however, contradictory results arise from confusion around which of the several automatically generated data are the most contributory and useful to detect a particular clinical state. Our aim for this study was to apply machine learning techniques and nonlinear analyses to a physiological time series dataset in order to find the best predictor for forecasting episodes in mood disorders. Methods We employed three different techniques: entropy calculations and two different machine learning approaches (genetic programming and Markov Brains as classifiers) to determine whether mood, energy or sleep was the best predictor to forecast a mood episode in a physiological time series. Results Evening energy was the best predictor for both manic and depressive episodes in each of the three aforementioned techniques. This suggests that energy might be a better predictor than mood for forecasting mood episodes in bipolar disorder and that these particular machine learning approaches are valuable tools to be used clinically. Conclusions Energy should be considered as an important factor for episode prediction. Machine learning approaches provide better tools to forecast episodes and to increase our understanding of the processes that underlie mood regulation.

1042,"Cognitive, behavioral, and autonomic correlates of mind wandering and perseverative cognition in major depression","Autonomic dysregulation has been hypothesized to play a role in the relationships between psychopathology and cardiovascular risk. An important transdiagnostic factor that has been associated with autonomic dysfunction is perseverative cognition (PC), mainly present in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the form of rumination. As the ability to adaptively let our mind wander without ruminating is critical to mental health, this study aimed to examine the autonomic concomitants of functional vs. dysfunctional intrusive thoughts in MDD. Ambulatory heart rate (HR) and variability (HRV) of 18 MDD subjects and 18 healthy controls were recorded for 24 h. Approximately every 30 min during waking hours subjects reported their ongoing thoughts and moods using electronic diaries. Random regression models were performed. Compared to controls, MDD subjects were more often caught during episodes of PC. In both groups, PC required more effort to be inhibited and interfered more with ongoing activities compared to mind wandering (MW) (ps < 0.0001). This cognitive rigidity was mirrored by autonomic inflexibility, as PC was characterized by lower HRV (p < 0.0001) compared to MW. A worse mood was reported by MDD patients compared to controls, independently of their ongoing cognitive process. Controls, however, showed the highest mood worsening during PC compared to being on task and MW. HRV during rumination correlated with self-reported somatic symptoms on the same day and several dispositional traits. MDD subjects showed lower HRV during sleep, which correlated with hopelessness rumination. Results show that PC is associated with autonomic dysfunctions in both healthy and MDD subjects. Understanding when spontaneous thought is adaptive and when it is not may clarify its role in the etiology of mood disorders, shedding light on the still unexplained association between psychopathology, chronic stress, and risk for health.; ambulatory monitoring, ecological momentary assessment, heart rate, heart rate variability, major depression disorder, mind wandering, perseverative cognition, rumination","Ottaviani, Cristina; Shahabi, Leila; Tarvainen, Mika; Cook, Ian; Abrams, Michelle & Shapiro, David",1,1042

The article by Fazel et al. descried premature mortality in patients with epilepsy. Sleep disturbance has been reported to be more prevalent in patients with partial epilepsy compared with controls, and most domains of sleep were substantially affected. The commentators wonder whether Fazel et al. have collected data about sleep disturbances in their sample. Furthermore, functional imaging of the brain could help us to understand suicidal behavior in more detail. Maybe there is a suicidal brain independent of concomitant diseases or a specific disease that triggers a pattern of suicidal brain dysfunction.

1044,Insufficient sleep in adolescents: causes and consequences,"Insufficient sleep poses an important and complicated set of health risks in the adolescent population. Not only is deficient sleep (defined as both sleep duration inadequate to meet sleep needs and sleep timing misaligned with the body's circadian rhythms) at epidemic levels in this population, but the contributing factors are both complex and numerous and there are a myriad of negative physical and mental health, safety and performance consequences. Causes of inadequate sleep identified in this population include internal biological processes such as the normal shift (delay) in circadian rhythm that occurs in association with puberty and a developmentally-based slowing of the sleep drive"" and external factors including extracurricular activities excessive homework load evening use of electronic media caffeine intake and early school start times. Consequences range from inattentiveness reduction in executive functioning and poor academic performance to increased risk of obesity and cardio-metabolic dysfunction mood disturbances which include increased suicidal ideation a higher risk of engaging in health risk behaviors such as alcohol and substance use and increased rates of car crashes occupational injuries and sports-related injuries. In response to these concerns a number of promising measures have been proposed to reduce the burden of adolescent sleep loss including healthy sleep education for students and families and later school start times to allow adolescents to obtain sufficient and appropriately-timed sleep.; ""Adolescent Behavior/*physiology, Sleep/*physiology, Sleep Deprivation/*epidemiology, Adolescent, Circadian Rhythm/physiology, Humans, Schools, Sleep Deprivation/complications, Sleep Deprivation/etiology, Students/psychology, Time Factors","Owens, Judith A. & Weiss, Miriam R.",0,1044
1045,Suicide Risk and the Menstrual Cycle: a Review of Candidate RDoC Mechanisms,"Purpose Of Review: Risk for suicidal behavior may fluctuate across the menstrual cycle. Here, we use the RDoC framework to review potential mechanisms by which the cycle may increase acute suicide risk.; Recent Findings: The menstrual cycle impacts the majority of RDoC constructs linked to suicide risk, particularly among hormone-sensitive women, such as those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual exacerbation of a psychiatric disorder. Despite this, there are no published studies examining suicidal ideation, planning, or behavior longitudinally across the cycle. More work is needed to understand how hormone sensitivity may relate to both trait and state suicide risk. Intensive multilevel investigations of cyclical hormone effects on suicide risk through specific RDoC mechanisms are suggested. This is a fertile research area and may provide key insights regarding the mechanisms of acute suicide risk.; Estradiol, Menstrual cycle, Progesterone, RDoC, Suicide","Owens, Sarah A. & Eisenlohr-Moul, Tory",0,1045
1046,Abusive prescription of psychostimulants: a study of two cases,"Because psychostimulants have serious possible side effects and particular potential for abuse, their therapeutic indications are today exclusively limited to disorders such as obesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We report two cases of abusive prescription of these drugs. The first concerns a woman who was treated for a 3 kg weight gain with fenproporex for 5 years and presented a withdrawal syndrome when this drug was no longer marketed in France. In the second case, a woman who complained of atypical sleep problems was prescribed modafinil, methylphenidate, clobazam, lormetazepam, meprobamate, and aceprometazine, and was found dead in her home a few weeks later in unexplained circumstances. For these two patients, neither the indications, nor the contraindications, nor the prescribing rules for these restricted drugs had been complied with. This case report highlights the extreme danger of these substances and stresses the importance of adhering to the rules of prescription.;Central Nervous System Stimulants/*adverse effects, Substance-Related Disorders/*etiology, Adult, Depression/drug therapy, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Obesity/drug therapy, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology, Suicide, Attempted","PÃ©lissier-Alicot, Anne-Laure; Piercecchi-Marti, Marie-Dominique; Bartoli, Christophe; Kuhlmann, Erika; Coiffait, Philippe-Emmanuel; Sanvoisin, Alain; Giocanti, Dominique & LÃ©onetti, Georges",0,1046
1047,Varenicline for smoking cessation in schizophrenia: Safety and effectiveness in a 12-week open-label trial,"Objective: Varenicline was approved by the FDA in 2006. In 2009, based largely on case r eports, the FDA issued a warning of possible adverse neuropsychiatric effects including depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior for varenicline and bupropion. Prospective trials of varenicline have not reported increased incidence of psychiatric adverse events other than sleep disturbance, but smokers with major mental illness have been excluded from large prospective trials of varenicline to date. We sought to evaluate the effect of a standard open-label 12-week varenicline trial on prospectively assessed safety and smoking outcomes in adults with stable, treated schizophrenia spectrum disorder and nicotine dependence. Methods: One-hundred twelve stable outpatients who smoked 10 or more cigarettes/day participated in a 12-week open-label smoking cessation trial of varenicline and weekly group cognitive behavioral therapy. Participants took varenicline for 4 weeks before attempting cessation. Trained raters collected safety and smoking outcome data weekly. Results: Participants demonstrated improved psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms from baseline to week 12 or early termination. At the end of 12 weeksâ€™ open-label treatment, the 14- and 28-day continuous abstinence rates were 47.3% and 34%, respectively. Expired carbon monoxide declined significantly during treatment in those who did not achieve abstinence. Conclusions: This prospective study suggests that varenicline may be well tolerated and effective for smoking cessation in combination with group cognitive behavioral therapy in stable outpatients with schizophrenia, a group with high rates of smoking and smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality.

1048,Safety of selegiline transdermal system in clinical practice: Analysis of adverse events from postmarketing exposures,"Objective: The objective of this analysis is to present the safety profile of selegiline transdermal system (STS) in clinical practice after US Food and Drug Administration approval by analyzing reported postmarketing adverse events (AEs). Method: Deidentified data were obtained on AEs, regardless of causality, as collected and compiled in the pharmaceutical company's adverse event collection systems/databases after the launch of STS in the United States. All reports of hypertensive crisis, suicide attempts, and STS overdoses were carefully examined to independently determine relation of the AE to STS. Results: From April 2006 to October 2010, a total of 3,155 AEs in 1,516 patients were reported (5.2% of the total exposures; N = 29,141), regardless of causality. The most frequently reported categories of AEs were general disorders (no. of AEs = 1,037, 3.6%) and central nervous system (CNS) disorders (no. of AEs = 574, 2.0%). A total of 266 reports (0.9%) were classified as serious AEs; CNS disorders (no. of AEs = 71, 26.7%) and cardiac and vascular disorders (no. of AEs = 44, 16.5%) were most common. There were 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension, although objective clinical data were not submitted in any of these cases. Thirteen drug-drug interactions (0.04%) were reported, and 5 were classified as serious. Conclusion: The most commonly reported AEs were application site reactions and insomnia. Very few patients reported a hypertensive event, and there were no objectively confirmed reports of hypertensive crisis with food at any STS dose. Therapeutic doses of STS appear to have a safety profile in clinical practice that is consistent with that observed in clinical trials. However, given the relatively modest exposure numbers, continued safety monitoring is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1049,Association of sedative-hypnotic medications with suicidality,"Several studies have investigated the association between sedative-hypnotics and suicidally, as such medications not only serve as a method for suicide, but are also involved in the usual options for treating psychiatric and medico-surgical disorders. According to population-based studies in Europe, Asia and the USA, sedative-hypnotic medications were significantly associated with suicide. However, these studies failed to address psychiatric comorbidities, new hypnotic medications, such as Zolpidem, and the specific times at which such medications were used. Recently, Brower and colleagues have investigated the association of the prescription of sedative-hypnotic drugs with suicidally, to determine whether such medications were associated with suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts in a large-cohort sample. They found that the use of sedative-hypnotic medications was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts. In addition, the use of sedative-hypnotic medications was a stronger predictor than insomnia of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. This article will discuss the relationship between prescription of sedative-hypnotic medications and suicide in the context of the potential limitations and significance of this recent research.

Depression rates were lower among the physically active and sports players and higher among cigarette smokers and Ss reporting such personality traits as insomnia, exhaustion, cyclothymia, and self-consciousness; rates were unrelated to alcohol consumption. Suicide rates were largely unrelated to antecedent physical activity and alcohol consumption, were higher among smokers, and were substantially higher among men reporting personality traits that predicted increased rates of depression.

1051,Burnout and career choice motivation in medical students,"Background: Burnout is a stress-induced syndrome, which affects medical students. Some environmental and personal factors can favor burnout onset and its serious consequences as dropping out, sleep disorders, depression, and suicide. The motivation for choosing medicine is a personal aspect that can modulate the distress with academic demands. Methods: We applied self-administered questionnaires in 277 medical students to investigate the predictive role of career choice motivations on burnout dimensions. Specifically, we studied the influence of the main reasons for choosing medicine on emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy. Results: Intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships were the most common reasons for choosing medicine. However, the medical students motivated by personal illness or family memberâ€™s illness or death revealed a significant greater emotional exhaustion when compared with the students with other motivations. Conclusion: The students who apply for medical school motivated by illness/death experiences are at a great risk for burnout. We suggest that students who are at risk for emotional exhaustion can be identified at the admission of medical school. Primary prevention strategies for burnout should consider this risk group.

1052,"Stress-related sleep reactivity is associated with insomnia, psychopathology and suicidality in pregnant women: preliminary results","Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during pregnancy and may have negative consequences on mothers and newborns. Deterioration of sleep quality throughout pregnancy increases insomnia, which may lead to adverse outcomes including increased psychopathology in the perinatal period. Thus, identifying women at high risk of developing insomnia may have important clinical implications on maternal-fetal outcomes. Stress-related sleep reactivity is a well-established risk factor for future insomnia, depression, and anxiety in general adult samples. However, little is known of sleep reactivity and its relations to sleep and mood pathology in pregnancy. Therefore, we explored sleep reactivity in pregnant women and its relations to prenatal symptoms of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and suicidality.Method: Sixty-two pregnant women (mean age 33.6 ± 3 years, 20.6 ± 0.6 weeks of pregnancy) were evaluated during their routine visit at the Gynecological Unit of the University of Pisa, Italy, using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia symptoms, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test for sleep reactivity (FIRST), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for depressive symptoms, and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety symptoms. Item #10 of the EPDS was used to assess for suicidality. Differences in means between women with high vs low stress-related sleep reactivity were calculated using t-test or Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon test. Linear/multiple regression analyses have been performed to study associations between variables.Results: Pregnant women with high stress-related sleep reactivity, relative to those with low reactivity, reported greater symptoms of insomnia (t = 6.5, 0.004) as well as higher rates of depression (62.0% vs 6.1%, p < 0.001), anxiety (55.1% vs 15.1%, p = 0.030), and suicidality (17.2% vs 3.0%, p = 0.025). Multivariate models revealed sleep reactivity to correlate independently with symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety, when controlling for comorbid symptoms.Conclusions: In mid-pregnancy, women with high sleep reactivity report elevated symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and are more likely to endorse suicidal ideation. As a prognostic marker of future insomnia and psychiatric illness, early detection of high prenatal sleep reactivity holds potential to prevent the development of sleep and mood pathology during pregnancy, thereby potentially improving maternal and child outcomes",Palagini L; Cipollone G; Masci I; Novi M; Caruso D; Kalmbach DA; Drake CL,1,1052
1053,"Insomnia symptoms predict emotional dysregulation, impulsivity and suicidality in depressive bipolar II patients with mixed features","Introduction: Insomnia symptoms are very common in Bipolar Disorder. Our aim was to assess the potential association between insomnia, emotion dysregulation and suicidality in subjects with Bipolar Disorder. Methods: Seventy-seven subjects with Bipolar Disorder type II with a depressive episode with mixed features were recruited. Patients were assessed with SCID-DSM-5, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) while evaluating manic and depressive symptoms. Results: Subjects with insomnia symptoms compared to those without showed higher scores in the DERS scale and subscales, including impulsivity, and in the SSI scale. Insomnia symptoms significantly predicted the severity of depressive symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and suicidality in subjects with bipolar disorder. In particular, insomnia was related to difficulties in some areas of emotion regulation including impulsivity. Emotion dysregulation significantly mediated the association between insomnia and depressive symptoms (Z = 2.9, p = 0.004). Furthermore, emotional impulsivity mediated the association between insomnia symptoms and suicidality (Z = 2.2, p = 0.03). Conclusion: In our study, subjects with bipolar disorder suffering from insomnia experienced a greater severity of depressive symptoms and suicidality compared to subjects without insomnia. Insomnia was associated with emotion dysregulation, impulsivity and suicidality. Further research is necessary to investigate if these latter features may benefit from early insomnia treatment in subjects with bipolar disorder.

1054,"Affective status in relation to impulsive, motor and motivational symptoms: personality, development and physical exercise","The contributions of impulsive and risk-taking behaviour in depressive and bipolar disorders, motivational and motor behaviours in anhedonic and substance addictive states, and the factors, particularly distress and trauma, underlying the development of neuropathology in affective status are described from clinical, epidemiological and laboratory perspectives. In order to distinguish one case factor for biopsychological substrates of health, an array of self-reported characteristics, e.g., positive or negative affect, stress or energy, optimism, etc., that may be predictive or counterpredictive for the propensity for physical exercise and activity were analysed using a linear regression in twelve different studies. Several individual characteristics were found to be markedly and significantly predictive of the exercise propensity, i.e., positive affect, energy, health-seeking behaviour and character, while optimism was of lesser, though significant, importance. Several individual characteristics were found to be significantly counterpredictive: expression of BDI- and HAD-depression, major sleep problems and lack/negligence of health-seeking behaviour. The consequences of physical activity and exercise for both affective well-being, cognitive mobility and neurogenesis is noted, particularly with regard to developmental assets for younger individuals. Affective disorder states may be studied through analyses of personal characteristics that unfold predispositions for symptoms-profiles and biomarkers derived from properties of dysfunction, such as impulsiveness, temperament dimensions, anhedonia and 'over-sensitivity', whether interpersonal or to reward.; Individuality*, Motivation*, Personality*, Exercise/*psychology, Mood Disorders/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Affect, Animals, Biomarkers/metabolism, Cognition, Disease Susceptibility, Humans, Impulsive Behavior/complications, Impulsive Behavior/psychology, Middle Aged, Mood Disorders/complications, Motor Activity, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Personality Inventory, Rats, Reinforcement (Psychology), Risk-Taking, Self-Assessment","Palomo, Tomas; Beninger, Richard J.; Kostrzewa, Richard M. & Archer, Trevor",1,1054
1055,Prediction of individual season of birth using MRI,"Previous research suggests statistical associations between season of birth (SOB) with prevalence of neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, personality traits such as novelty and sensation seeking, and suicidal behavior. These effects are thought to be mediated by seasonal differences in perinatal photoperiod, which was recently shown to imprint circadian clock neurons and behavior in rodents. However, it is unknown whether SOB is associated with any measurable differences in the normal human adult brain, and whether individual SOB can be deduced based on phenotype. Here I show that SOB predicts morphological differences in brain structure, and that MRI scans carry spatially distributed information allowing significantly above chance prediction of an individual's SOB. Using an open source database of over 550 structural brain scans, Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis showed a significant SOB effect in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) in males (p=0.009, FWE whole-brain corrected), with greater gray matter volumes in fall and winter births. A cosinor analysis revealed a significant annual periodicity in the left STG gray matter volume (Zero Amplitude Test: p<5Ã—10(-7)), with a peak towards the end of December and a nadir towards the end of June, suggesting that perinatal photoperiod accounts for this SOB effect. Whole-brain VBM maps were used as input features to multivariate machine-learning based analyses to classify SOB. Significantly greater than chance prediction was achieved in females (overall accuracy 35%, p<0.001), but not in males (overall accuracy 26%, p=0.45). Pairwise binary classification in females revealed that the highest discrimination was obtained for winter vs. summer classification (peak area under the ROC curve=0.71, p<0.0005). Discriminating regions included fusiform and middle temporal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobe, cerebellum, and dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Results indicate that SOB is detectable with MRI, imply that SOB exerts effects on the developing human brain that persist through adulthood, and suggest that neuroimaging may be a valuable intermediate phenotype in bridging the gap between SOB and personality and neurobehavioral disorders.; Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

1056,"The neuropsychiatry of multiple sclerosis: Focus on disorders of mood, affect and behaviour","Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). They include two broad categories of disturbances: abnormalities in cognition, and abnormalities of mood, affect and behaviour. The present review deals with the epidemiology, clinical features, etiology and treatment of disturbances included in the second category, i.e., major depression, fatigue and sleep disorders, bipolar disorder, euphoria, pathological laughing and crying, anxiety, psychosis and personality changes. Major depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in MS with an approximate 50% lifetime prevalence rate. Early recognition and management of depression in MS is of major importance because it is a key predictor of morbidity, mortality, quality of life, possibly physical outcome and disease exacerbations, adherence to immunomodulatory treatments and suicide risk in MS patients, as well as of the caregiverâ€™s distress and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders in MS has been incompletely investigated. It is postulated that a complex interplay of biological, disease-related, behavioural and psychosocial factors contribute to the pathophysiology of most of them. Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS is often effective, although commonly based on evidence provided by case studies and uncontrolled trials. A comprehensive biopsychosocial neuropsychiatric approach is essential for the optimal care of patients with MS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1057,Suicidal thought and behavior in individuals with restless legs syndrome,"Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is associated with an unrelenting urge to move at night, which can cause chronic sleeplessness, depression, and despondency; thus increasing risk of suicide. We aimed to determine frequency of suicidal ideation and behavior in RLS.; Methods: RLS and control participants were recruited through community and RLS Foundation advertisements. RLS diagnosis was confirmed using the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS Questionnaire and severity was assessed using the International RLS Study Group Severity Scale (IRLSS). Lifetime suicidal ideation (plan) and behavior (attempt) was assessed using the Suicidal Behavior Questionnaire-revised. The Brief Lifetime Depression Scale evaluated lifetime depression history. Forward stepwise logistic regression determined the odds of suicidal ideation or behavior.; Results: In this study, 192 RLS and 158 control participants were comparable for age, sex, race, and other potential demographic confounders. In general, RLS was moderate-to-severe (mean IRLSS 26.4Â Â±Â 7.5). Significantly more RLS than control participants had lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior (27.1% vs. 7.0%; pÂ <Â 0.00001) or lifetime depression history (65.6%% vs. 22.8%; pÂ <Â 0.00001). The odds of having a lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior was higher in those with RLS [2.80 (1.29,6.11)], even after accounting for depression and other confounders. In RLS, the odds of lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior was increased if there was lifetime depression [7.37 (2.65,20.47)] or if RLS in the past was severe or very severe [2.36 (1.03,5.40)].; Conclusions: Lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior is prevalent in RLS sufferers, and its likelihood is dependent on RLS severity and depression history.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Analyses are based on data from the 2007 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. The survey used a cross-sectional, national and representative sample consisting of 78 843 students (grades 7-12) who were selected using a stratified, clustered, multistage sampling method. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to test the association between sleep and suicide variables while controlling for demographic characteristics and other potential risk factors of suicide. Results: Fewer than 4 h of sleep and a lack of feeling refreshed after sleeping increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation but not of suicide attempts. Conclusions: Non-restorative sleep as well as short sleep duration are significantly associated with suicidal ideation in adolescents. This finding highlights the need to assess for both non-restorative sleep and short sleep duration when screening suicide risk in adolescents. Future research should examine the moderating or mediating effects of individual and environmental characteristics on the association between sleep and actual suicide attempt.

Method:We examined the data set from the Survey of Living Conditions and Welfare Needs of Korean Older Persons, which was conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs (KIHASA) in 2011. In that survey, 10,674 participants were randomly selected from those older than age 65. Simultaneous multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the risk factors of suicidal ideation in terms of their sociodemographic and health-related variables. Subsequently, the PAF was calculated with adjustment for other risk factors. Results: The weighted prevalences of depression and suicidal ideation were 30.3% and 11.2%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with decreased risk of suicidal ideation included old-old age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66 for 75 to 79 years, OR = 0.52 for 80 to 84 years, OR = 0.32 for older than 85 years), economic status (OR = 0.59 for 5th quintile; more than US$25,700 per year), whereas those associated with increased risk included poor social support (OR = 1.28), currently smoking (OR = 1.42), sleep problems (OR = 1.74), chronic illness (OR = 1.40), poor subjective health (OR = 1.56), functional impairment (OR = 1.45), and depression (OR = 4.36). Depression was associated with a fully adjusted PAF of 45.7%, followed by chronic illness (19.4%), poor subjective health status (18.9%), sleep problems (14.1%), functional impairment (4.9%), poor social support (4.2%), and currently smoking (3.6%). Conclusions: Preventive strategies focused particularly on depression might reduce the impact of suicidal ideation in the elderly population. Also, specific mental health centers focused on the specific needs of the elderly population should be established to manage suicidal risk.

1060,Association between high sensitivity CRP and suicidal ideation in the Korean general population,"Inflammation has been linked with a potential critical role in suicide. The purpose of this study is to examine the relation of CRP with suicidal behavior in the Korean population. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 4693 Korean adults aged 20â€“81 years who participated in the 2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. High sensitivity CRP levels were measured by immunoturbidimetric method. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were assessed by using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed in 2017. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 4.9% and that of suicide attempt was 0.4%. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent in the highest compared with the lowest serum CRP quartile (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11â€“2.89) after adjustment for age, sex, household income, educational level, marital status, employment status, alcohol dependency, current smoking, physical activity, BMI, sleep duration, number of chronic diseases, restriction on activity, subjective health status, perceived stress, depression and depressive mood (p for trend < 0.05). In conclusion, elevated levels of CRP were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation among South Korean adults.

Methods: Data from 1122 patients with depressive disorders in the REAP-AD study were used. The ICD-10 was employed to diagnose depressive episodes and recurrent depressive disorder. The presence or absence of suicidal thoughts/acts and profile of other depressive symptoms was established using the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for depression. Country/area differences in rates of suicidal thoughts/acts were evaluated with the Ï‡Â² test. In addition, depressive symptom profiles, other clinical characteristics, and patterns of psychotropic drug prescription in depressed patients with and without suicidal thoughts/acts were compared using analysis of covariance for continuous variables and logistic regression analysis for discrete variables to adjust the effects of covariates. Results: The rates of suicidal thoughts/acts in 10 countries/areas varied from 12.8% in Japan to 36.3% in China. Patients with suicidal thoughts/ acts presented more persistent sadness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.64, p < 0.001), loss of interest (aOR = 2.33, p < 0.001), fatigue (aOR = 1.58, p < 0.001), insomnia (aOR = 1.74, p < 0.001), poor concentration (aOR = 1.88, p < 0.001), low self-confidence (aOR = 1.78, p < 0.001), poor appetite (aOR = 2.27, p < 0.001), guilt/self-blame (aOR = 3.03, p < 0.001), and use of mood stabilisers (aOR = 1.79, p < 0.001) than those without suicidal thoughts/acts. Conclusion: Suicidal thoughts/acts can indicate greater severity of depression, and are associated with a poorer response to antidepressants and increased burden of illness. Hence, suicidal thoughts/acts can provide a clinical index reflecting the clinical status of depressive disorders in Asians.

1062,"Association between energy drink intake, sleep, stress, and suicidality in Korean adolescents: energy drink use in isolation or in combination with junk food consumption","Background: A considerable amount of research suggests that the frequent use of caffeinated energy drinks may be associated with undesirable effects, particularly so in children and adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the associations between energy drink intake and mental health problems, in isolation or in combination with junk food consumption, in a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents.; Methods: Data from the 2015 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey, collected from 68,043 adolescents aged 12-18 years (mean age 15.09â€‰Â±â€‰1.72Â years), were analyzed. Questionnaires were administered to collect information related to dietary behavior including energy drink intake and junk food consumption. Single item measures of sleep dissatisfaction, stress, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt were also administered. Associations between energy drink intake and sleep dissatisfaction, perceived severe stress, persistent depressive mood, and suicidality were investigated, and a multivariate approach was taken so that additional variance from demographic and lifestyle factors could be controlled for statistically.; Results: Energy drink intake was significantly associated with sleep dissatisfaction (adjusted odd ratios [AORs]â€‰=â€‰1.64 and 1.25), severe stress (AORsâ€‰=â€‰2.23 and 1.38), depressive mood (AORâ€‰=â€‰2.59 and 1.51), suicidal ideation (AORsâ€‰=â€‰3.14 and 1.43), suicide plan (AORsâ€‰=â€‰4.65 and 1.78), and suicide attempt (AORsâ€‰=â€‰6.79 and 1.91), with a higher risk for more frequent use of energy drinks (â‰¥5 times/wk) than for less frequent use (1-4 times/wk). The detrimental effect of energy drinks on mental health was particularly prominent in frequent junk food consumers.; Conclusions: Our data suggest that energy drink intake had detrimental effects related to stress, sleep dissatisfaction, mood, and suicidality, in isolation or in combination with junk food consumption, in Korean adolescents.

1063,Violence Victimization in Korean Adolescents: Risk Factors and Psychological Problems,"We examined the risk factors for and psychological problems associated with violence victimization in a nationwide representative sample of Korean adolescents. Data from the 2016 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey was used. Participants were asked about their experience of being a victim of violence that required medical treatment during the past 12 months, as well as their perceived health, happiness, sleep satisfaction, stress, depressed mood, and suicidality. The 12-month prevalence of violence victimization requiring medical treatment was 2.4%. The results indicated that adolescents were at an increased risk for violence victimization if they were male, older, had parents of a foreign nationality, did not reside with their family, worked part time, resided in small cities or rural areas, were high or low in socioeconomic status (SES), exhibited high or low levels of academic performance, used alcohol or tobacco, and were sexually active. In addition, while violence victimization was negatively associated with perceived health and happiness, it was positively associated with perceived stress, depressed mood, and suicidality. The results indicate that a social disadvantage, involvement in risky behavior, and psychological problems are associated with violence victimization. Effective violence prevention efforts should thus target high-risk groups, and clinical attention is needed to address the psychological costs associated with violence victimization.; Crime Victims*/psychology, Crime Victims*/statistics & numerical data, Violence*/psychology, Violence*/statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Bullying, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Parents, Prevalence, Republic of Korea, Risk Factors, Risk-Taking, Social Class, Surveys and Questionnaires, adolescents*, bullying*, risk factors*, victim*, violence*","Park, Subin; Lee, Yeeun; Jang, Hyesue & Jo, Minkyung",0,1063

Participants were middle- and high-school students (nâ€‰=â€‰65â€‰528) in grades 7-12. Participants' dietary behaviours were assessed using questionnaires on three encouraged dietary behaviours (consumption of fruits, vegetables, and milk) and three discouraged behaviours (skipping breakfast and consumption of fast food and soft drinks). Participants were also asked to rate their perceived general and oral health, happiness, sleep satisfaction, stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation.; Results: After adjusting for sex, school grade, residential area, socioeconomic status, and other dietary behaviours, a high intake of fast food and soft drink and frequent skipping of breakfast were all associated with worse physical and mental health status. Moreover, a high intake of fruits, vegetables, and milk were associated with better perceived general health, oral health, happiness, and sleep satisfaction.; Conclusions: Our data suggest that existing encouraged dietary habits mostly have beneficial effects on perceived physical and mental health in Korean adolescents.

1065,Is insufficient sleep duration associated with suicidal behavior in Korean adolescents?,"The second leading cause of death among Korean adolescents was suicide in 2014. We assessed the relationship between sleep duration and suicidal behavior (ideation, planning and attempt) using data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS). KYRBS is an anonymous online survey in self-reporting format that investigates the health status of middle and high school students. Weekly sleep duration was divided into six groups (more than 8, 7â€“8, 6â€“7, 5â€“6, 4â€“5 h, less than 4 h). We compared the more-than-8-h group with others for sleep duration-associated suicidal behavior. Results showed that even though the confidence interval for the odds ratio for some sleep duration groups was not significant, there was a statistically significant inverse positive trend of suicidal behavior (ideation, planning and attempt) with the sleep duration groups (P value for trend â‰¤ 0.001). In conclusion, this study found that short average weekday sleep duration among Korean adolescents was associated with suicidal behavior independent of various confounding factors, which includes depressed mood.

1066,"Insufficient sleep and suicidal ideation: a survey of 12,046 female adolescents","Objectives: Adolescence is a period of adaptation to social, hormonal, and physical changes. Because of these changes, adolescents are at risk for depression and suicidal thoughts. Female adolescents tend to be more sensitive to hormonal and emotional changes. Although the reciprocal relationship among depression, poor sleep quality, and suicide has been studied, whether decreased sleep time leads to depression-mediated suicide or induces suicide itself remains to be determined. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze (using a path analysis) the indirect (i.e., due to depression) and direct effects of sleep on suicidal ideation for female adolescents.; Methods: We use nationally representative data from the Korean juvenile health behavior online survey to analyze the sleep effects on suicidal ideation. A total of 12,046 Korean female adolescents were included in this study. We analyzed data from the juvenile health behavior online survey (2017) conducted by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and identified variables that could affect the mental health of female adolescents. A path analysis was performed to determine the direct role of sleep in suicidal ideation.; Results: Decreased sleep was one of the several risk factors for suicidal ideation. Unexpectedly, after controlling for other risk factors including depression and socioeconomic factors, insufficient sleep was found to have direct effects on suicidal ideation. The indirect effect of insufficient sleep on suicidal ideation was mediated by depression.; Conclusion: Sleep is a modifiable factor that could reduce the suicide rate among female adolescents and could be targeted through public health prevention efforts.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

1067,Consensus Statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the Recommended Amount of Sleep for Healthy Children: Methodology and Discussion,"Abstract: Members of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine developed consensus recommendations for the amount of sleep needed to promote optimal health in children and adolescents using a modified RAND Appropriateness Method. After review of 864 published articles, the following sleep durations are recommended: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Sleeping the number of recommended hours on a regular basis is associated with better health outcomes including: improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health. Regularly sleeping fewer than the number of recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems. Insufficient sleep also increases the risk of accidents, injuries, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and depression. Insufficient sleep in teenagers is associated with increased risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts.; Commentary: A commentary on this article apears in this issue on page 1439.; Â© 2016 American Academy of Sleep MedicineHealth Behavior/*physiology, Sleep/*physiology, Sleep Medicine Specialty/*methods, Academies and Institutes, Adolescent, Child, Humans, Time Factors, United States, consensus*, pediatric*, sleep duration*","Paruthi, Shalini; Brooks, Lee J.; D'Ambrosio, Carolyn; Hall, Wendy A.; Kotagal, Suresh; Lloyd, Robin M.; Malow, Beth A.; Maski, Kiran; Nichols, Cynthia; Quan, Stuart F.; Rosen, Carol L.; Troester, Matthew M. & Wise, Merrill S.",0,1067
1068,Anxiety Disorders in Older Patients,"Anxiety complaints are common among older people. Specific phobia is characterized by exaggerated fear to a specific object or situation. Fear of falling is one example and occurs in about 50% of older persons who have fallen recently. Polypharmacy heightens fall risks. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by chronic uncontrollable worry that interferes with functioning and is accompanied by restlessness and disturbed sleep. Panic disorder refers to recurrent, unexpected surges of intense fear that evidence physical and cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive behavior therapy has efficacy among psychotherapies for older anxious adults. In treating anxiety, medications that might be anxiogenic are reduced in dosage or discontinued. It is essential to monitor for suicidal ideation and symptom change. The first-selected pharmacotherapy for people with most anxiety disorders is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The risk-benefit ratio of benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy in elderly patients is not favorable",Pary R; Sarai SK; Micchelli A; Lippmann S,0,1068
1069,Reflecting on the Germanwings Disaster: A Systematic Review of Depression and Suicide in Commercial Airline Pilots,"Background: The 2015 Germanwings Flight 9525 disaster, in which 150 people were killed after the co-pilot may have intentionally crashed the plane in a suicide attempt, highlights the importance of better understanding the mental health of commercial airline pilots. However, there have been few systematic reviews investigating the topic of mental health in commercial aviation. This systematic review aims to identify the types and prevalence of mental health disorders that commercial airline pilots experience with a focus on mood disorders and suicide risk.; Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Eligible studies were assessed and data was extracted and analyzed.; Results: 20 studies were identified. The prevalence of depression experienced by commercial airline pilots in this review ranged from 1.9% to 12.6%. Factors that negatively impacted the mental health of pilots included substance abuse, experiencing verbal or sexual abuse, disruption in sleep circadian rhythms and fatigue.; Discussion: This systematic review identifies that commercial airline pilots may experience depression at least as frequently as the general population. Commercial airline pilots experience occupational stressors, such as disrupted circadian rhythms and fatigue which may increase risks of developing mood disorders. Most studies identified in this review were cross-sectional in nature with substantial limitations. There is a clear need for further higher quality longitudinal studies to better understand the mental health of commercial airline pilots.; commercial aviation, mental health, mood disorders, pilot, suicide","Pasha, Terouz & Stokes, Paul R.

1070,Changes in millennial adolescent mental health and health-related behaviours over 10 years: a population cohort comparison study,"There is evidence that mental health problems are increasing and substance use behaviours are decreasing. This paper aimed to investigate recent trends in mental ill health and health-related behaviours in two cohorts of UK adolescents in 2005 and 2015.Methods: Prevalences in mental health (depressive symptoms, self-harm, anti-social behaviours, parent-reported difficulties) and health-related behaviours (substance use, weight, weight perception, sleep, sexual intercourse) were examined at age 14 in two UK birth cohorts; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 5627, born 1991-92) and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, N = 11 318, born 2000-02). Prevalences and trend estimates are presented unadjusted and using propensity score matching and entropy balancing to account for differences between samples.Results: Depressive symptoms (9% to 14.8%) and self-harm (11.8% to 14.4%) were higher in 2015 compared with 2005. Parent-reported emotional difficulties, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems were higher in 2015 compared with 2005 (5.7-8.9% to 9.7-17.7%). Conversely, substance use (tried smoking, 9.2% to 2.9%; tried alcohol, 52.1% to 43.5%, cannabis, 4.6% to 3.9%), sexual activity (2% to 0.9%) and anti-social behaviours (6.2-40.1% to 1.6-27.7%) were less common or no different. Adolescents in 2015 were spending less time sleeping (<8 h 5.7% to 11.5%), had higher body mass index (BMI) (obese, 3.8% to 7.3%) and a greater proportion perceived themselves as overweight (26.5% to 32.9%). The findings should be interpreted bearing in mind limitations in ability to adequately harmonize certain variables and account for differences in attrition rates and generalizability of the two cohorts.Conclusions: Given health-related behaviours are often cited as risk factors for poor mental health, our findings suggest relationships between these factors might be more complex and dynamic in nature than currently understood. Substantial increases in mental health difficulties, BMI and poor sleep-related behaviours highlight an increasing public health challenge",Patalay P; Gage SH,1,1070
1071,The impact of stalkers on their victims,"100 victims of stalking completed a 50-item questionnaire to assess the impact of the experience on their psychological, social, and interpersonal functioning as well as their risk for physical and sexual assault. The majority of the victims were subjected to multiple forms of harassment including being followed, repeatedly approached, and bombarded with letters and telephone calls for periods varying from 1 mo to 20 yrs. Threats were received by 58 Ss, and 34 were physically or sexually assaulted. All but 6 victims made major changes in their social and work lives, with 53% changing or ceasing employment and 39% moving home. Increased levels of anxiety were reported by 83%, intrusive recollections and flashbacks by 55%, with nightmares, appetite disturbances, and depressed mood also being commonly reported. Suicidal ruminations were acknowledged by 24% of victims. The criteria for a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were fulfilled in 37% of Ss, with a further 18% having the clinical features but not qualifying for a stressor involving threatened or actual physical harm. Results indicate the extent of the social and psychological damage sustained by victims of persistent stalking, and underline the inadequacy of legal and medical responses to their needs.

A 6-wave prospective study of adolescent health and emotional well-being was conducted. A self-administered computerized form of the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) was used as a 1st phase diagnostic measure. Second phase assessment using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) allowed the delineation of a group fulfilling criteria on both instruments. The ICD-10 symptoms and severity profiles for depression were generated with standard algorithms. 1,947 Ss completed phase 1 assessment at least once. Participation rates at phase 2 interviews were 93%. Over the 30-mo study period, 69 Ss fulfilled criteria for ICD-10 depressive episodes on both the CIS-R and CIDI. 21 Ss had experienced a severe episode, 32 moderate, and 16 mild episodes. Loss of interest and pleasure, decreased energy and fatigue, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation and diminished concentration distinguished Ss with depressive disorder from controls. Self-reproach and guilt, psychomotor agitation and/or retardation and appetite disturbance with weight change showed the clearest increase in frequency with increasing severity of episode.

The highest risk of suicide attempts is noted in affective disorders. Objective: The aim of the study was to look for suicide risk factors among sociodemographic and clinical factors, family history and stressful life events in patients with diagnosis of unipolar and bipolar affective disorder (597 patients, 563 controls). Method: In the study, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Operational Criteria Diagnostic Checklist questionnaires, a questionnaire of family history, and a questionnaire of personality disorders and life events were used. Results: In the bipolar and unipolar affective disorders sample, we observed an association between suicidal attempts and the following: family history of psychiatric disorders, affective disorders and psychoactive substance abuse/dependence; inappropriate guilt in depression; chronic insomnia and early onset of unipolar disorder. The risk of suicide attempt differs in separate age brackets (it is greater in patients under 45 years old). No difference in family history of suicide and suicide attempts; marital status; offspring; living with family; psychotic symptoms and irritability; and coexistence of personality disorder, anxiety disorder or substance abuse/dependence with affective disorder was observed in the groups of patients with and without suicide attempt in lifetime history.

The POTS group's sleep efficiency was significantly lower (t[873]= -11.32; p<0.001) and sleep disturbances because of pain were significantly higher (t[873]=15.36; p<0.001) than controls. Chi-square testing showed a larger proportion of individuals at high-risk for suicide among POTS patients than controls (c2 [1, n=875]=55.6; p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that sleep scores (Î²=0.23, p<0.001), age (Î²=-0.03, p<0.001), and illness with POTS (Î²=0.68, p=0.05) were significantly associated with suicide ideation scores (F[4, 870]=38.34, p<0.001).

Cognitive functional impairment in adolescent patients with first-episode depression was related to gender, educational level, suicide risk, sleep disorder, total HRSD score, and disease duration. The stepwise multiple-linear regression analysis obtained the regression equation as follows: Y1 (total MCCB points) = 82.741 + 11.897 Ã— X3 (educational level) â€“ 8.914 Ã— X6 (total HRSD score) â€“ 8.457 Ã— X7 (total disease duration). Cognitive impairment in adolescent patients with first-episode depression was related to their gender, educational level, suicide risk, sleep disorders, HRSD score, and disease duration. Further, educational level, HRSD score, and disease duration were identified as high-risk factors.

1081,Eszopiclone-induced Parasomnia with Suicide Attempt: A Case Report,"Eszopiclone is a benzodiazepine-like hypnotic that is commonly prescribed to treat insomnia. However, eszopiclone's efficacy has been questionable in several clinical trials, and its pharmacologic profile makes its effects on sleep and behavior difficult to predict. We report a case demonstrating an instance of eszopiclone-induced parasomnia involving paranoia and a suicide attempt in a patient taking eszopiclone. We explore possible biochemical explanations examining the pharmacologic profile of eszopiclone and its potential for drug-drug interactions, especially with concomitant administration of monoaminergic medications such as antidepressants. Caution should be exercised when prescribing these medications, and evidence-based treatments for insomnia (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, sedating antidepressants) should be considered prior to sedative-hypnotic administration.; Eszopiclone, benzodiazepine-like, drug reaction, hypnotic, insomnia, parasomnia, sedative","Pennington, J.

1082,Suicidality associated with antiepileptic drugs: Implications for the treatment of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia,"The objective of this article is to review recent research on suicidality and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and to discuss its implications for the treatment of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. A Medline search exploding the MESH terms suicide"" and ""anticonvulsants"" and a PubMed search were conducted. Studies included in this review were generally limited to those that appeared in 2008 and after and considered relevant to FDA and EMA warnings. The FDA conducted a meta-analysis that focused on 199 placebo-controlled trials of 11 AEDs. The treatment groups contained a total 27863 patients and the placebo groups contained 16029 patients. Approximately 25% of these patients had epilepsy 27% had psychiatric disorders including mood disorders and schizophrenia and 48% were classified as having ""other"" conditions including obesity insomnia migraine and various pain disorders. The FDA concluded that AEDs appeared to increase the risk of suicidality regardless of treatment indication specific AED or mechanism of action and that increased risk was observed as early as 1 week after treatment initiation and continued for at least 24 weeks. Despite its limitations the literature reviewed in this article suggests that the risk of suicidality - although small in absolute terms - should be considered carefully in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain fibromyalgia and other chronic pain conditions for which treatment with an AED is being considered.

Use of novel approaches for the analysis of data from multiple psychological scales might facilitate the identification of key indicators of mental health.; Aims: The aim of current study was to examine the relationship between multiple risk factors for mental illness, using a network analysis perspective.; Methods: A sample of 334 young Colombian adults (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰21.7) were evaluated with validated scales measuring several psychosocial factors previously associated with mental health (e.g. worry, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, childhood abuse, alcohol related-problems and personality traits). A total of 24 nodes were included in the network analysis and topology, centrality, and stability of the networks were studied.; Results: Specific nodes that occupied critical positions in the network were identified, with worry, perceived distress and low energy being the most central nodes.; Conclusions: Our explorative findings suggest that a network analysis might identify risk factors that have a central role in the multiple dimensions of emotional health in young adults.

1084,Lack of association between testosterone and suicide attempts,"Objective: To determine whether testosterone levels differ in male suicide attempters versus healthy controls and to explore the associations between testosterone levels and time of blood collection, and between testosterone levels and characteristics of suicide attempts. Method: A sample of 112 male suicide attempters was studied. Thirty-seven male blood donors were recruited as controls. Results: The mean testosterone levels were 5.1 Â± 2.9 ng/ml in male attempters and 4.6 Â± 1.6 ng/ml in controls. Group differences in testosterone levels were not significant when we studied the interaction with time of extraction (F = 0.37; d.f. = 2; p = 0.70) or when matched by age and time of extraction (t = -0.74; d.f. = 26; p = 0.47). When partial correlations were performed correcting for the effect of time of extraction, significant partial correlations were found in testosterone levels with history of aggressive behavior and lethality of the attempt. Conclusions: When circadian variation and age were considered, we found no support for the putative role of testosterone as a biological marker of suicidal behavior. Further research should consider: (1) testosterone and neurosteroids; (2) serial determinations with a minimal time gap between the attempt and the blood extraction; (3) controls within the same time periods, and (4) other variables that may affect testosterone levels, such as body mass index, physical activity and sleep disturbances.

1085,Nocturnal Wakefulness as a Previously Unrecognized Risk Factor for Suicide,"Objective: Suicide is a major public health problem and the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. The identification of modifiable risk factors is essential for reducing the prevalence of suicide. Recently, it has been shown that insomnia and nightmares significantly increase the risk for suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, and death by suicide. While both forms of sleep disturbance may independently confer risk, and potentially be modifiable risk factors, it is also possible that simply being awake at night represents a specific vulnerability for suicide. The present analysis evaluates the frequency of completed suicide per hour while taking into account the percentage of individuals awake at each hour.; Methods: Archival analyses were conducted estimating the time of fatal injury using the National Violent Death Reporting System for 2003-2010 and the proportion of the American population awake per hour across the 24-hour day using the American Time Use Survey.; Results: The mean Â± SD incident rate from 06:00-23:59 was 2.2% Â± 0.7%, while the mean Â± SD incident rate from 00:00-05:59 was 10.3% Â± 4.9%. The maximum incident rate was from 02:00-02:59 (16.3%). Hour-by-hour observed values differed from those that would be expected by chance (P < .001), and when 6-hour blocks were examined, the observed frequency at night was 3.6 times higher than would be expected by chance (P < .001).; Conclusions: Being awake at night confers greater risk for suicide than being awake at other times of the day, suggesting that disturbances of sleep or circadian neurobiology may potentiate suicide risk.; Â© Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Circadian Rhythm*, Wakefulness*, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Suicide/*statistics & numerical data, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Female, Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Statistics as Topic, Young Adult","Perlis, Michael L.; Grandner, Michael A.; Brown, Gregory K.; Basner, Mathias; Chakravorty, Subhajit; Morales, Knashawn H.; Gehrman, Philip R.; Chaudhary, Ninad S.; Thase, Michael E. & Dinges, David F.",1,1085
1086,Suicide and sleep: Is it a bad thing to be awake when reason sleeps?,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death, worldwide, for those between the ages of 24 and 44 y old. In 2013, more than 41,000 suicides occurred in the United States. These statistics underscore the need to 1) understand why people die by suicide and 2) identify risk factors that are potentially modifiable. While it has been posited that sleep disturbance may represent one such factor, systematic research in this arena did not begin until the 2000s. Since that time, sleep disturbance has been reliably identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. While insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disorders have each been found to contribute to the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior, it is also possible that these factors share some common variance. One possibility is that sleep disturbance results in being awake at night, and being awake at night also confers risk. The hypothesis proffered here is that being awake when one is not biologically prepared to be so results in 'hypofrontality' and diminished executive function, and that this represents a common pathway to suicidal ideation and behavior. Such a proposition is highly testable under a variety of possible protocols. The current review summarizes the extant literature on suicide rates by time-of-day, and discusses circadian, psychosocial, and neurocognitive explanations of risk. Such a focus promises to enhance our understanding of how sleep disturbance may confer risk, allows for the identification of future lines of research, and further justifies the need for interventions that promote good sleep continuity among at-risk individuals.

Mrs D is a 38-year-old woman, mother of a 5-year-old boy, without psychiatric history. She had developed a major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence after her divorce 2 years earlier. Her depressive symptoms consisted of depressed mood, irritability, insomnia, loss of appetite, guilt, markedly diminished interest and pleasure in almost all activities, difficulties to concentrate, and suicidal thoughts. In January 2007, an ambulatory psychiatric follow-up consisting of supportive therapy was started, and a treatment of duloxetine 60 mg/d was introduced, followed by marked improvement of her depressive symptoms and reduction of her alcohol consumption to 1 or 2 beers per day. She stopped smoking, without using any nicotine substitution product such as nicotine patches. She did not complain of any nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety or insomnia and did not crave for cigarettes.

1088,Trial for the Prevention of Depression (TriPoD) in final-year secondary students: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial,"Background: Evidence suggests that current treatments cannot fully alleviate the burden of disease associated with depression but that prevention approaches offer a promising opportunity to further reduce this burden. Adolescence is a critical period in the development of mental illness, and final school examinations are a significant and nearly universal stressor that may act as a trigger for mental health difficulties such as depression. The aim of the present trial is to investigate the impact of SPARX-R, an online, gamified intervention based on cognitive behavioural principles, on the prevention of depression in secondary school students before their final examinations.; Methods/design: Government, independent and Catholic secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to participate in the trial. All students enrolled in their final year of high school (year 12) in participating schools will be invited to participate. To account for possible attrition, the target sample size was set at 1600 participants across 30 schools. Participating schools will be cluster randomised at the school level to receive either SPARX-R or lifeSTYLE, an attention-controlled placebo comparator. The control intervention is an online program aimed at maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes will include symptoms of anxiety, suicidal ideation and behaviours, stigma and academic performance. Additional measures of cost-effectiveness, as well as process variables (e.g., adherence, acceptability) and potential predictors of response to treatment, will be collected. Consenting parents will be invited to complete measures regarding their own mental health and expectations for their child. Assessments will be conducted pre- and post-intervention and at 6- and 18-month follow-up. Primary analyses will compare changes in levels of depressive symptomatology for the intervention group relative to the attention control condition using mixed-effects model repeated-measures analyses to account for clustering within schools.; Discussion: This is the first trial of a universal depression prevention intervention delivered to school students in advance of a specific, significant stressor. If found to be effective, this program may offer schools a new approach to preparing students for their final year of schooling.; Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier: ACTRN12614000316606 .

1089,Manic reaction after induction of ovulation with gonadotropins,"Reports a case study of a 34-yr-old female who experienced a manic reaction to gonadotropin hormone-induced ovulation for the treatment of secondary infertility. Approximately midway through the course of ovulation induction, the S experienced rapid and dramatic heightening in mood. She described feeling high and energized and also described symptoms of reduced sleep, racing thoughts, and overactivity. In addition, she became hypersexual and preoccupied with sexual thoughts. After 2 mo, the manic symptoms began to subside, and the S subsequently became clinically depressed and was hospitalized for suicidal ideation. She was treated with sertraline with good response. It is noted that although the S had no risk factors for bipolar disorder (BPD), it is possible that the mood effects of gonadotropin are more marked in susceptible patients. Therefore, it may be prudent to monitor women with BPD or a family history of BPD for mood changes during ovulation induction.

1090,Longitudinal study of low serum LDL cholesterol and depressive symptom onset in postmenopause,"Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and subsequent depressive symptoms onset in postmenopausal women. We secondarily assessed serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), total cholesterol, and triglycerides.; Method: This population-based prospective cohort study utilizes data from 24,216 women between 50 and 79 years of age who were participants of the Women's Health Initiative, which originally ran from 1993 to 2005 and has since incorporated 2 extension studies, with the most recent culminating in 2015. Fasting lipids were measured for all participants at baseline and for a subset through 6 years of follow-up. Depressive symptoms were characterized using the Burnam 8-item scale for depressive disorders (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression/Diagnostic Interview Schedule short form) at baseline and during follow-up, using a cut point of 0.06 to indicate presence of depressive symptoms.; Results: The lowest quintile of LDL-c was associated with an increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.49, P = .01), and follow-up analyses demonstrated that the elevated risk appeared to be confined to the lowest decile (LDL-c < 100 mg/dL). Further, this elevated risk was moderated by lipid-lowering drug treatment. Elevated risk was demonstrated among those who reported no lipid-lowering medication use (HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03-1.47, P = .02), but not among those reporting use (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.18-2.29, P = .50).; Conclusions: Among postmenopausal women, untreated serum LDL-c below 100 mg/dL was associated with an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms. No excess risk was observed in those attaining LDL-c < 100 mg/dL with lipid-lowering therapy. These findings have important implications for risk assessment, treatment considerations, and mechanistic insight.; Â© Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Cholesterol, LDL/*blood, Depression/*blood, Postmenopause/*blood, Age of Onset, Aged, Female, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Middle Aged","Persons, Jane E.; Robinson, Jennifer G.; Coryell, William H.; Payne, Martha E. & Fiedorowicz, Jess G.",1,1090

At the time of admission, she reported depressive symptoms that had been worsening over the preceding two months. During that time, she had had difficulties in maintaining her daily activities as she was feeling sad, tired, and had problems concentrating. She was also struggling with falling and staying asleep and had reduced appetite, although she had gained up to 20 pounds over the six months before her admission. She experienced onset of depression at age 12 years, soon after her stepfather was deported and her mother began a subsequent escalation in use of alcohol. During the year that followed her first admission, she had six other inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations for high risk of suicide. In addition to her mood symptoms,, she also reported intrusive memories, recurrent flashbacks, and nightmares related to a history of sexual abuse. She was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) a few days before RTC admission, and was started on melatonin 3mg at bedtime for insomnia and prazosin 1mg at night with some improvement of nightmares.

1092,"Military- and sports-related mild traumatic brain injury: Clinical presentation, management, and long-term consequences","The current article explore that awareness of the potential long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) that has increased in recent years. Certain populations, such as military service members and athletes who play contact sports, are susceptible to repetitive mTBI. With the United States operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, where explosive devices have been commonly used, blast-related brain injuries have come under scrutiny. Each year, about 28,000 service members experience a traumatic brain injury, most of which are considered mild but are frequently repetitive. In the sports world, a consequence of repeated mild brain trauma that was first identified in boxing as punch drunk"" syndrome has been recognized in other contact sports as well. The US Army and the National Football League have recently partnered to share research and to encourage current and former personnel to recognize their own or others' brain injuries and seek help. Concussions are more serious than previously believed. Brain injuries especially multiple ones can have serious negative impacts on patients leading to changes in personality sleep problems and cognitive impairment and can increase the risk for suicide PTSD depression and anxiety. In some people repetitive mTBI can lead to CTE a neurodegenerative disorder. As awareness and reporting of mTBI in both military and sports settings increase evidence-based treatments and targeted suicide prevention strategies will hopefully emerge.

1094,A study of the risk of mental retardation among children of pregnant women who have attempted suicide by means of a drug overdose,"Background: The aim of the study was to estimate the effect on the fetal development of high doses of prescription drugs taken as a suicide attempt during pregnancy.; Methods: Pregnant women were identified among self-poisoned females in the toxicological inpatient clinic in Budapest between 1960 and 1993. Congenital abnormalities, intrauterine development based on birth weight and post-conceptional age, mental retardation, cognitive-behavioral status were compared in exposed children born to mothers who had attempted suicide by means of a drug overdose during pregnancy with their siblings, born either before or after the affected pregnancy, as sib controls.; Results: Of a total of 1 044 pregnant women, 74 used the combination of amobarbital, glutethimide and promethazine (TardylÂ®, one of the most popular drugs for treatment of insomnia in Hungary) for suicide attempt. Of these 74 women, 27 delivered live-born babies. The mean dose of TardylÂ® used for suicide attempts was 24 times the usually prescribed clinical dose. The rate of congenital abnormalities and intrauterine retardation was not higher in exposed children than in their sib controls. However, of the 27 exposed children, eight (29.6%) were mentally retarded (XÂ²â‚=79.7, p= Sig) while mental retardation did not occur among 46 sib controls. These exposed children were born to mothers who attempted suicide with TardylÂ® between the 14th and 20th post-conceptional weeks. The components of TardylÂ® used separately for a suicide attempt during pregnancy were not associated with a higher risk of mental retardation. Therefore the high doses of TardylÂ® associated with the high risk for mental retardation may be due to the interaction of its three drug components.; Conclusions: The findings of the study showed that the high doses of a drug containing three components may be associated with a significantly increased risk for mental retardation without any structural defects, whereas each of these three component drugs taken alone was not associated with this adverse effect.;Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*epidemiology, Fetal Development/*drug effects, Intellectual Disability/*epidemiology, Pregnant Women/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Adult, Amobarbital/poisoning, Birth Weight, Chi-Square Distribution, Drug Combinations, Drug Overdose, Female, Gestational Age, Glutethimide/poisoning, Humans, Hungary/epidemiology, Logistic Models, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Outcome, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Promethazine/poisoning, Risk Factors, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/drug therapy, Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data","Petik, Dora; Czeizel, Barbara; Banhidy, Ferenc & Czeizel, Andrew E",0,1094
1095,The spectrum of neurobehavioral sequelae after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury: a novel mouse model of chronic traumatic encephalopathy,"There has been an increased focus on the neurological sequelae of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly neurodegenerative syndromes, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); however, no animal model exists that captures the behavioral spectrum of this phenomenon. We sought to develop an animal model of CTE. Our novel model is a modification and fusion of two of the most popular models of TBI and allows for controlled closed-head impacts to unanesthetized mice. Two-hundred and eighty 12-week-old mice were divided into control, single mild TBI (mTBI), and repetitive mTBI groups. Repetitive mTBI mice received six concussive impacts daily for 7 days. Behavior was assessed at various time points. Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was computed and vestibulomotor function tested with the wire grip test (WGT). Cognitive function was assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), anxiety/risk-taking behavior with the elevated plus maze, and depression-like behavior with the forced swim/tail suspension tests. Sleep electroencephalogram/electromyography studies were performed at 1 month. NSS was elevated, compared to controls, in both TBI groups and improved over time. Repetitive mTBI mice demonstrated transient vestibulomotor deficits on WGT. Repetitive mTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. Both mTBI groups demonstrated increased anxiety at 2 weeks, but repetitive mTBI mice developed increased risk-taking behaviors at 1 month that persist at 6 months. Repetitive mTBI mice exhibit depression-like behavior at 1 month. Both groups demonstrate sleep disturbances.

1096,Human factors in the causation of road traffic crashes,"Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are responsible for a substantial fraction of morbidity and mortality and are responsible for more years of life lost than most of human diseases. In this review, we have tried to delineate behavioral factors that collectively represent the principal cause of three out of five RTCs and contribute to the causation of most of the remaining. Although sharp distinctions are not always possible, a classification of behavioral factors is both necessary and feasible. Thus, behavioral factors can be distinguished as (i) those that reduce capability on a long-term basis (inexperience, aging, disease and disability, alcoholism, drug abuse), (ii) those that reduce capability on a short-term basis (drowsiness, fatigue, acute alcohol intoxication, short term drug effects, binge eating, acute psychological stress, temporary distraction), (iii) those that promote risk taking behavior with long-term impact (overestimation of capabilities, macho attitude, habitual speeding, habitual disregard of traffic regulations, indecent driving behavior, non-use of seat belt or helmet, inappropriate sitting while driving, accident proneness) and (iv) those that promote risk taking behavior with short-term impact (moderate ethanol intake, psychotropic drugs, motor vehicle crime, suicidal behavior, compulsive acts).

1097,A cross-sectional analysis of factors that influence the detection of depression in older primary care patients,"Objective: To determine the characteristics of depressed older patients whose mental health status is detected by their general practitioner (GP). Method: Cross-sectional analytical design of 218 patients scoring above the cut-off (>16) of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), from a sample of 916 consecutive patients aged 60 years or over attending one of 54 randomly selected GPs in Western Australia. Prior to their medical consultation, patients completed a self-report questionnaire, which included questions about depressive symptomatology (CES-D). Following the consultation, general practitioners recorded the patient's presenting complaint(s), medication information, and mental health details on a patient summary sheet. Results: Among these 218 patients, 39.9% (87/218) were correctly classified as depressed by their GP. Detection of depressive symptomatology was associated with patients who acknowledged taking sleeping tablets (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.3-5.4), had CES-D scores indicative of major depression (>22) (OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.4-5.6) and were thought to be at risk for suicide (OR=35.1, 95% CI=4.5-274.2). Conclusions: While GPs are most apt to detect depression among older patients with prominent mental health symptoms, many patients in this age group silently experience significant depressive symptomatology and miss the opportunity for effective treatment. The routine use of screening tools in primary care is recommended to enhance the detection rate of depression in older adults.

1098,Predictors of suicidal ideation among depressed veterans and the interpersonal theory of suicide,"Background: We assessed whether key constructs of the interpersonal theory of suicide were associated with suicidal ideation in depressed US Veterans. Methods: 443 patients of the Veterans Health Administration diagnosed with a depressive disorder completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and Beck Hopelessness Scale, from which we derived measures of burdensomeness, belongingness, and hopelessness consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide. Measures of active and passive suicidal ideation were constructed from the Beck Suicide Scale and Beck Depression Inventory obtained at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of passive and active suicidal ideation while adjusting for demographic characteristics and somatic-affective symptoms of depression (e.g., anhedonia, insomnia). Results: Burdensomeness and hopelessness were significantly associated with passive suicidal ideation at baseline and 3 months follow-up, but belongingness and the interaction between belongingness and burdensomeness were not significant predictors as proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Somatic-affective depressive symptoms, but not any of the main effects predicted by the interpersonal theory of suicide or their interactions, were associated with active suicidal ideation at baseline. No factors were consistently associated with active suicidal ideation at 3 months follow-up. Limitations: The measure of burdensomeness used in this study only partially represents the construct described by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Conclusion: We found little support for the predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Hopelessness appears to be an important determinant of passive suicidal ideation, while somatic-affective depression symptoms may be a key contributor to active suicidal ideation.

1099,Symptom characteristics of depressive episodes prior to the onset of mania or hypomania,"Objective: Depressive episodes are typically the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. The evidence as to whether depressive episodes occurring in persons who later convert to bipolar disorder are symptomatically distinct from episodes of unipolar depression remains controversial. As there are crucial differences in the therapeutic management, symptom profiles indicating subsequent bipolar conversion may aid in appropriate treatment. Method: A representative community sample of originally N = 3021 adolescents and young adults aged 14â€“24 years at baseline was assessed up to four times over 10 years. Assessment of symptoms was conducted by clinically trained interviewers using the standardized M-CIDI. Symptom profiles of depressive episodes were compared via logistic regression between subjects that subsequently developed (hypo-)manic episodes (n = 35) or remained unipolar depressive (n = 659). Results: Initial depression amongst prospective converters was characterized by significantly increased suicidality (odds ratio, OR = 2.31), higher rates of feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt (OR = 2.52), complete loss of pleasure (OR = 2.53) and diurnal variation (OR = 4.30). No differences were found for hyperphagia, hypersomnia and psychomotor alterations. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the symptom profile of initial depressive episodes may be useful in the identification of subjects with an elevated risk for the subsequent conversion to bipolar disorder.

1100,Changes in quality of life after a suicide attempt,"The aim of this follow-up study was to examine factors related to a suicide attempt within 3 months of a prior attempt. Participants were recruited from a suicide-prevention center. Of 96 suicidal individuals who had participated in the baseline study, only 51 completed all measures at follow-up assessment. Study results showed that suicidal individuals who reattempted suicide during the first 3 months of follow-up care exhibited lower mean scores on all four domains of the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Instrument at follow-up assessment than at baseline. In contrast, individuals who did not reattempt suicide had higher quality-of-life scores across all domains between baseline and 3 months. The reattempt and no-reattempt groups differed significantly in the physical health and environmental domains. These results can be used by nurses to develop their abilities to recognize and prevent suicide reattempts in high-risk groups.

1101,Insomnia and the risk for suicide: Does sleep medicine have interventions that can make a difference?,"The global rate of suicide is estimated at 14-16 per 100,000 individuals, representing nearly one million deaths per year-- greater than homicide and war combined. The current issue of Sleep Medicine brings once more to the fore the possibility that sleep disturbance contributes to suicidal ideation, an indicator of great distress and, by extension, laying the foundation for more serious outcomes. The efficacy of sleep medicine interventions for insomnia is well-established, with growing support for their use in depressed samples as well as growing evidence for the efficacy of nightmare interventions. We suggest that a systematic set of studies can be developed that at once teach us more about the central role of sleep disturbances in the evolution of those clinical conditions in which suicide is most common and how to better intervene early in their course.

Lettau (see record [rid]2011-02544-017[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2010-19063-004[/rid]). We agree wholeheartedly with Dr. Lettauâ€™s suggestion that improving sleep may forestall or resolve episodes of depression, and subsequently reduce suicide rates, and with his suggested test of the hypothesis that sleep disturbances have a direct causative role in depression given similar proposals we have made. A major thrust of our argument(s) in the Sleep Medicine editorial was that suicide prevention efforts could be aided by targeting populations who are both at risk for suicide and who tend to have co-occurring sleep disturbances. While Lettau may see us as short-sighted to expand the focus beyond depression, there are many reasons to consider a broader view. While depressive conditions are, no doubt, a major risk factor for suicide, many who die never present clinically with such complaints, often being seen by their primary care clinicians not long before they kill themselves. In the end, we take a slightly different path to the same conclusion proffered by Lettau: restoration of adequate sleep in individuals vulnerable to engaging in lethal acts is an overlooked area of both research and clinical practice. We are pleased to have this exchange keep the spotlight on this issue.

1103,Insomnia as a Precipitating Factor in New Onset Mental Illness: a Systematic Review of Recent Findings,"Purpose: We aimed to systematically review recent publications (01/2014-03/2017) with longitudinal designs allowing for the assessment of the prospective risk of insomnia on new onset mental illness in key conditions: anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and suicide.; Recent Findings: A literature yielded 1859 unique articles meeting search criteria were identified; 16 articles met all selection criteria and reviewed with some studies reporting on more than one mental health outcome. Overall, the review supports the hypothesis that insomnia is a predictor of subsequent mental illness. The evidence is strongest for an insomnia-depression relationship. The new studies identified and reviewed add to a modest number of publications supporting a prospective role of insomnia in new onset mental illness in three areas: anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and suicide. The few selected new studies focused on SUD were mixed, and no studies focused on PTSD were identified that met the selection criteria.

1104,"The relationship between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide among adults: A systematic review","Suicide is a significant global health concern; identification of modifiable risk factors can guide future research and prevention efforts. A systematic literature review was undertaken to summarize whether disrupted sleep, which has garnered increased attention as a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, has continued to be associated with suicide in recent years. The search resulted in 1,806 abstracts with 188 identified for full text review. Limiting studies to 2012-2015 publications with adult participants and an interpretable relationship between sleep and suicide outcomes left 36 articles for the review. Five new articles focused on suicide decedents, eight on veteran/military populations, but relatively few were longitudinal studies (n = 4) and none assessed sleep apnea. A majority of studies used statistical methods to control for psychopathology, strengthening the overall finding that recent work lends further support for disrupted sleep as an important risk factor, and potential warning sign, for suicide.

1105,Sleep disturbance preceding suicide among veterans,"Objectives: We examined the role of sleep disturbance in time to suicide since the last treatment visit among veterans receiving Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services. Methods: Among 423 veteran suicide decedents from 2 geographic areas, systematic chart reviews were conducted on the 381 (90.1%) who had a VHA visit in the last year of life. Veteran suicides with a documented sleep disturbance (45.4%) were compared with those without sleep disturbance (54.6%) on time to death since their last VHA visit using an accelerated failure time model. Results: Veterans with sleep disturbance died sooner after their last visit than did those without sleep disturbance, after we adjusted for the presence of mental health or substance use symptoms, age, and region. Conclusions: Findings indicated that sleep disturbance was associated with time to suicide in this sample of veterans who died by suicide. The findings had implications for using the presence of sleep disturbance to detect near-term risk for suicide and suggested that sleep disturbance might provide an important intervention target for a subgroup of at-risk veterans.

1106,"Longitudinal relationships of insomnia, nightmares, and PTSD severity in recent combat veterans","Objective: This observational, longitudinal study of veterans with recent combat exposure describes the prevalence, severity and associations of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, and nightmares over time. Methods: Eighty recent combat veterans recruited from Veterans Health Administration primary care settings met inclusion criteria including hazardous alcohol use and at least subthreshold PTSD. Insomnia status and nightmare status were assigned based on the Insomnia Severity Index total score and the PTSD Checklist nightmare item, respectively. Participants were re-assessed six months following their baseline assessment. Analyses of variance compared insomnia and nightmare groups on PTSD, depression, and alcohol use severity. Analyses of covariance (controlling for baseline differences) examined whether insomnia and/or nightmares were associated with the clinical course of PTSD. Persistence of conditions was also examined. Results: At baseline, 74% presented with insomnia and 61% endorsed distressing nightmares. Insomnia was associated with significantly higher PTSD and depression severity at both baseline and six-months. The presence of nightmares was associated with significantly higher PTSD severity at both time points and with depression severity at baseline only. Despite decreases in PTSD and depression severity, insomnia severity was relatively unchanged after six months. The prevalence and severity of nightmare complaints diminished modestly over time. Conclusion: Among this sample of recent combat veterans, insomnia and nightmares were each strongly associated with the severity of both PTSD and depressive symptoms. Over time, insomnia in particular did not appear to resolve spontaneously and was associated with ongoing PTSD. Addressing insomnia early, therefore, may be a strategy to alter the course of PTSD.

1107,Sleep disturbances and their association with mental health among women exposed to intimate partner violence,"Background: Intimate partner violence puts the victim at risk for substantial medical and psychiatric morbidity. As with other stress- and trauma-related experiences, intimate partner violence is associated with sleep disturbance, particularly insomnia and nightmares. This association, however, has not been well characterized in terms of general prevalence or its further relationship with depression, suicidality, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: The present study used validated instruments to characterize insomnia and nightmares among 121 women exposed to intimate partner violence. Participants with and without depression were compared on demographic, abuse, and sleep characteristics as were those with and without suicidality. Logistic regression models were constructed to test sleep variables as independent predictors of depression controlling for demographic factors, abuse severity, and PTSD severity. Results: Clinically significant insomnia and nightmares were observed in 46% and 32% of participants, respectively. Depressed women had more severe PTSD and were more likely to have insomnia and to have nightmares than nondepressed women. In models controlling for PTSD severity, the presence of insomnia was associated with an approximately eightfold greater risk of being depressed; nightmares were associated with a twofold increase in risk. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances were prevalent among women experiencing intimate partner violence, with both insomnia and nightmares predicting the presence of depression even after controlling for PTSD severity. In addition to the need to address common mental health issues such as depression, given that sleep problems are modifiable and potentially less stigmatizing than mental health problems, assessing and addressing insomnia and nightmares in survivors of interpersonal violence warrants strong clinical consideration and further investigation.

1108,Brief cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia delivered to depressed veterans receiving primary care services: A pilot study,"Background: Depression and insomnia are treatable, often co-occur and are common among primary care patients. Treatments designed for primary care must be brief, effective and ideally have the potential to address multiple symptoms. A brief form of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) was piloted among depressed primary care patients with insomnia some of whom endorsed suicidal ideation. Methods: Veterans Affairs primary care patients were randomized to either CBT-I or sleep hygiene. CBT-I consisted of two, 20â€“40min in-person sessions and two 15â€“20min telephone sessions; SH consisted of one in-person and one telephone session. Participants were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and a 3 month follow-up. Results: Compared to SH (n = 14), brief CBT-I (n = 13) had large effects on insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, and time awake after sleep onset with between group effect sizes ranging from .75 to 1.09 at post-treatment and .66â€“.89 at follow-up, though significance was not maintained at follow-up. Although both groups experienced significant reductions in depression severity, statistically significant group by time interactions were not observed for depression. Limitations: Notable limitations include the small sample size, having excluded patients with the most severe suicide risk, and the absence of objective testing to detect presence of sleep disorders other than insomnia. Conclusions: The effects observed for insomnia outcomes, corroborate support for using CBT-I in depressed patients and extend this support to a brief from of CBT-I structured for delivery in primary care. Whether a brief form of CBT-I delivered to patients in primary care who endorse suicidal ideation would have a significant effect on depressive symptoms and/or suicidal ideation remains to be tested in a fully powered trial.

1109,Meta-analysis of sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts and behaviors,"This article presents a meta-analysis of sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The potential association of various sleep disturbances to suicidal thoughts and behaviors is the subject of several reviews. The current meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the size of the association generally as well as between more specific relationships. The meta-analysis was performed using random effects models. The size of associations was calculated for all types of sleep disturbances and suicide outcomes combined and for more specific categories including nightmares, insomnia, and insomnia subtypes and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Overall, sleep disturbance was significantly associated with an increased relative risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide ranging from 1.95 to a relative risk of 2.95 in unadjusted studies. This meta-analysis supports an association between sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Sleep disturbances in general, as well as insomnia and nightmares individually, appear to represent a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behavior.

1110,Validation of the Sleep-Wake Scoring of a New Wrist-Worn Sleep Monitoring Device,"Study Objectives: To test the sleep-wake scoring reliability of a new wrist-worn sleep monitoring device.; Methods: Twenty-seven adult good sleepers underwent 1 night of polysomnography (PSG) while wearing both the new device (myCadian [MC]; CurAegis Technologies, Rochester, New York, United States) and commercially available actigraphy (Actiwatch 2 [AW]; Philips Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, United States) on their nondominant wrist. PSG tests were manually stage scored. After excluding missing data, 20 participants had full-night data on all three devices with 17,734 total 30-second epochs. Using PSG as the gold standard, pooled epoch-by-epoch agreement for sleep and wake was calculated for each device using percent agreement and Cohen kappa statistic. Positive predictive values for both sleep and wake epochs, as well as sleep continuity statistics, were calculated.; Results: Percent agreement with PSG-scored wake and sleep was 91.3% for MC (kappa = 0.67) and 87.7% for AW (kappa = 0.50). Positive predictive values for sleep epochs were 94.4% and 90.8% for MC and AW, respectively, and 74.5% and 65.6% for wake. Both devices underestimated wake and overestimated sleep compared to PSG. Descriptively, compared to PSG, sleep latency was higher with MC and wake after sleep onset higher with AW. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were more similar across devices.; Conclusions: The kappa statistic for MC is consistent with a high level of agreement with PSG. Overall, the reliability of MC compared to PSG scoring was slightly more favorable than that of AW. Findings suggest that MC provides reliable sleep-wake scoring during a nocturnal sleep period for good sleepers.; Â© 2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.actigraphy, polysomnography, reliability, sleep-wake scoring, validation, wearable device","Pigeon, Wilfred R.; Taylor, Maddison; Bui, Ashley; Oleynk, Courteney; Walsh, Patrick & Bishop, Todd M.",0,1110
1111,Insomnia and hypnotic medications are associated with suicidal ideation in a community population,"Suicidal ideation (SI), a significant predictor of suicide, is associated with sleep disturbance, which is seldom assessed using stringent diagnostic criteria and validated sleep instruments in community samples. Cross-sectional data, including sleep diaries and validated instruments, from 767 community adults were used to identify variables associated with SI and subsequently entered into a regression model to predict SI. Suicidal ideation was endorsed by 9.3% of the sample. This group differed from non-ideators on several variables, but only insomnia diagnosis, depression severity, and hypnotic medication use predicted SI. Findings confirm an association of insomnia with SI using stringent criteria and controlling for depression. If treating insomnia is a conceivable pathway to reduce SI, the apparent risk posed by hypnotics may limit treatment options. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Onset of severe insomnia and anxiety was right after childbirth but not treated. Obsessive thinking pattern became more prominent. The patient became depressed and sought psychiatric help four months after delivery. Insomnia was then treated pharmacologically. Anxiety and depression persisted, suicidal ideation emerged, and the patient became confused, indecisive, overwhelmed, and delusional regarding her child's health. Medications for depression and anxiety were started six months postpartum yet were ineffective. The patient's obsessions gradually became fully psychotic and she committed an altruistic infanticide eight months postpartum. Psychiatric hospitalization occurred, followed by a long course of mental, physical, legal, and social rehabilitation. She was minimally responsive to psychopharmacological treatment, which appeared to be partly related to her hormonal dysregulation.

Central nervous system-active medications have the potential to affect mood; therefore, post hoc analysis of clinical trial data was conducted to evaluate psychiatric adverse events (PAEs) and effects on mood of NB therapy versus placebo.; Subjects/methods: Data were pooled from 5 prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (duration range, 24-56 weeks) of NB in subjects with overweight or obesity. PAEs were collected via AE preferred terms, organized into major subtopics (e.g., anxiety, depression, sleep disorders), and divided into category terms (e.g., anxiety, potential anxiety symptoms). Additionally, the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS-SR; score range 0-84) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) evaluated treatment-emergent depressive/anxiety symptoms and suicidal behavior/ideation, respectively.; Results: Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were comparable for placebo (nâ€‰=â€‰1515) and NB (nâ€‰=â€‰2545). Most common PAEs in the NB group (using category grouping; NB vs placebo) were sleep disorders (12.7 vs 7.9%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), anxiety (5.4 vs 3.3%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.029), and depression (1.8 vs 2.7%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.014); PAEs were more frequent during dose escalation and generally mild or moderate. Mean (SD) changes in IDS-SR total score from baseline to endpoint were small in both groups: 0.13 (5.83) for NB and -0.45 (5.65) for placebo. Retrospective AE categorization via C-CASA confirmed no completed suicides, suicide attempts, or preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior.; Conclusions: This large pooled analysis of 5 clinical trials provides additional safety information about the NB PAE profile. Anxiety and sleep disorder-related PAEs were more frequent with NB versus placebo but were mostly mild to moderate and generally occurred early. Depression-related PAEs were less common with NB than placebo, and NB was not associated with suicidal ideation or behavior in this patient population.; ","Pi-Sunyer, Xavier; Apovian, Caroline M.; McElroy, Susan L.; Dunayevich, Eduardo; Acevedo, Lisette M. & Greenway, Frank L.",1,1113
1114,VA eScreening program: Technology to improve care for post-9/11 veterans,"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services to a growing number of veterans. There is ample support for the use of technology-based self-screening to support health care delivery. We developed the VA eScreening program for veterans to directly provide self-report mental and physical health information through a veteran-facing portal that communicates with the electronic medical records system. A total of 1,372 newly enrolling veterans in 2 cohorts participated in a study to assess veteran satisfaction, determine accessibility and clinical processes, measure screening differences, and examine connection to care between eScreening and paper screening. Veterans who completed eScreening were slightly more satisfied with screening than those who completed paper screening. Accessibility, rate of screening completion, and clinical processes were significantly better with eScreening than paper screening. Except for higher alcohol use in the paper-based cohort, veterans who completed paper and eScreening were similar in the rates of positive health screens. Connection to VA services, rate and speed of vesting in the health care system, and time to document required suicide risk assessments were better with the VA eScreening program than paper screening. The VA eScreening program is a unique and promising tool that may leverage limited resources to improve screening and care for veterans.

1115,"Treatment of paediatric narcolepsy with sodium oxybate: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-withdrawal multicentre study and open-label investigation","Background: Narcolepsy is a lifelong neurological disorder with onset commonly in childhood or adolescence. No drugs are indicated for cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in paediatric patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is approved for use in adult patients with excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy, or both, in narcolepsy. We aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of sodium oxybate oral solution treatment in children and adolescents who have narcolepsy with cataplexy.; Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-withdrawal, multisite study and open-label investigation done at 30 sites in five countries (USA, Finland, France, Italy, and the Netherlands). Eligible participants were aged 7-16 years at screening, had narcolepsy with cataplexy, and were either being treated with sodium oxybate or were sodium oxybate-naive at entry. Sodium oxybate-naive participants were titrated to an optimal dose. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with a dynamic randomisation algorithm to receive placebo or to remain on sodium oxybate for 2 weeks; they then entered an open-label sodium oxybate treatment period for a total study duration of up to 1 year. Random assignment to placebo was discontinued if early efficacy was shown in the preplanned interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, which was change in weekly number of cataplexy attacks. Participants entering the study after the interim analysis would then be assigned to receive open-label sodium oxybate for 2 weeks. The primary analysis of efficacy and safety included data collected until the cutoff date of Feb 10, 2017. The efficacy population consisted of all participants randomly assigned to receive an intervention who completed at least 5 days of dosing in the double-blind treatment period, and the safety population consisted of all participants who took the study drug, including open-label sodium oxybate. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02221869.; Findings: Between Oct 1, 2014, and Feb 10, 2017, we enrolled 106 participants, and 104 took the study drug (the safety population). 96 (92%) of these participants completed the stable-dose period, of whom 63 participants (the efficacy population) were randomly assigned to receive sodium oxybate (n=31) or placebo (n=32) for 2 weeks. A preplanned interim analysis of the primary endpoint showed efficacy (p=0Â·0002), resulting in discontinuation of the placebo arm following guidance from the data safety monitoring board; 33 participants then received sodium oxybate on an open-label basis during the double-blind period. Participants who were randomly assigned to receive placebo and who were withdrawn from sodium oxybate (32 [51%] of 63 patients) had increased weekly cataplexy attacks (median increase of 12Â·7 attacks per week [Q1, Q3=3Â·4, 19Â·8]) when compared with those randomly assigned to continue treatment with sodium oxybate (median increase of 0Â·3 attacks per week [-1Â·0, 2Â·5]; p<0Â·0001). Commonly reported (>5%) adverse events were enuresis (15 [21%] of 72 sodium oxybate-naive participants vs four [13%] of 32 participants taking sodium oxybate at study entry), nausea (16 [22%] vs two [6%]), vomiting (15 [21%] vs two [6%]), headache (13 [18%] vs four [13%]), decreased weight (11 [15%] vs one [3%]), decreased appetite (eight [11%] vs none), nasopharyngitis (seven [10%] vs none), and dizziness (five [7%] vs 1 [3%]). Two serious adverse events (one event of severe acute psychosis and one event of moderate suicidal ideation) were reported, and both were considered to be related to the study drug. There were no reported deaths.; Interpretation: These results support the clinical efficacy of sodium oxybate for the treatment of both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in narcolepsy in children. The safety profile of sodium oxybate was consistent with that observed in adult patients.; Funding: Jazz Pharmaceuticals.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A practicing psychiatrist describes the bureaucratic nightmare he encountered when trying to provide care for a 21-year-old college student who tried to commit suicide. Not surprisingly, treating psychotic patients can be incompatible with the rigid restrictions of managed care plans. The psychiatrist argued to continue to give the patient a medication that had been working rather than to switch to a less expensive medication and risk having the patient take no medication at all and end up in the hospital, or worse. He also had difficulty in explaining that this patient was willing to take two 5-mg tablets but not one 10-mg tablet. The psychiatrist's interventions were ultimately successful. However, the time and effort involved infighting such restrictions discourages this psychiatrist and others from taking on additional difficult-to-treat psychotic patients.

1117,Insomnia as a predictor of high-lethality suicide attempts,"Introduction: Research has demonstrated that patients with insomnia are at an increased risk of experiencing suicidal ideation and/or making a suicide attempt.; Objectives: To evaluate the relation between insomnia and suicidal behaviour.; Aims: To examine factors associated with a diagnosis of insomnia in patients admitted to an Emergency Department (ED) and assessed by the psychiatrist in charge.; Methods: Participants were 843 patients consecutively admitted to the ED of Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, between January 2010 and December 2011. All patients admitted were referred to a psychiatrist. A clinical interview based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and a semi-structured interview was conducted. Patients were asked about 'ongoing' suicidal ideation or plans for suicide.; Results: Forty-eight percent of patients received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD) or an anxiety disorder; whereas, 17.1% were diagnosed with Schizophrenia or other non-affective psychosis. Patients with insomnia (compared to patients without insomnia) more frequently had a diagnosis of BD (23.9% vs. 12.4%) or MDD (13.3% vs. 9.5%; pÂ <Â 0.001). Moreover, patients with insomnia less frequently had attempted suicide in the past 24Â h (5.3% vs. 9.5%; pÂ <Â 0.05) as compared with other patients, but those patients with insomnia who attempted suicide more frequently used a violent method (64.3% vs. 23.6%; pÂ <Â 0.01) compared to other suicide attempters.; Conclusions: Our results do not support an association between insomnia and suicidal behaviour. However, suicide attempters with insomnia more frequently used violent methods, and this phenomenon should be taken into serious consideration by clinicians.; Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*complications, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Bipolar Disorder/complications, Depressive Disorder, Major/complications, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Rome, Schizophrenia/complications, Suicidal Ideation, Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data","Pompili, M; Innamorati, M; Forte, A; Longo, L; Mazzetta, C; Erbuto, D; Ricci, F; Palermo, M; Stefani, H; Seretti, M E; Lamis, D A; Perna, G; Serafini, G; Amore, M & Girardi, P",1,1117
1118,Completed suicide in schizophrenia: Evidence from a case-control study,"Suicide is the single major cause of death among patients with schizophrenia. Despite great efforts in the prevention of such deaths, suicide rates have remained alarming, pointing to the need for a better understanding of the phenomenon. The present sample comprised 20 male patients with schizophrenia who committed suicide and who were investigated retrospectively for a large number of characteristics. Controls were 20 living patients with schizophrenia. The results suggest that suicide attempts, hopelessness and self-devaluation were the three variables most strongly associated with completed suicide. However, a number of variables were identified which may constitute risk factors, some of which have not been identified in the past: agitation and motor restlessness (OR=3.66; 95% CI=0.95/14.02), self-devaluation (OR=28.49; 95% CI=3.15/257.40), hopelessness (OR=51.00; 95% CI=7.56-343.72), insomnia (OR=12.66; 95% CI=0.95/14.02), mental disintegration (OR=3.66; 95% CI=0.95/14.02), and suicide attempt (OR=3.66; 95% CI=1.40/114.41). Poor adherence to medications was also predictive of completed suicide in our sample of schizophrenia patients, primarily because the suicide victims showed very low adherence.

1119,Early onset of action and sleep-improving effect are crucial in decreasing suicide risk: The role of quetiapine XR in the treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression,"Although the possibilities of antidepressive pharmacotherapy are continuously improving, the rate of nonresponders or partial responders is still relatively high. Suicidal behavior, the most tragic consequence of untreated or unsuccessfully treated depression, commonly observed in the first few weeks of antidepressive treatment before the onset of therapeutic action, is strongly related to certain symptoms of depression like insomnia. The present paper reviews the newly discovered and well-documented antidepressive effect of quetiapine in bipolar and unipolar depression with special focus on its early onset of action and its sleep-improving effects. Both beneficial effects play an important role in the reduction of suicidal risk frequently observed in depressed patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1120,Suicidal Risk Emerging During Antidepressant Treatment: Recognition and Intervention,"Object: To review current understanding of risks of adverse behavioral responses to antidepressant treatment that include newly emerging agitation, anger, and suicidality. Method: We report a series of illustrative cases after briefly reviewing the relevant research literature. Results: We describe 10 cases involving suicidality arising with increasing anxiety, insomnia, restlessness, agitation, irritability, anger, psychosis, or mixed manic-depressive features. In each case, rapid improvement followed recognition of the problem, stopping or curtailing antidepressant treatment and adding or substituting an antimanic, antipsychotic or anxiolytic agent. Conclusions: Suicidality can emerge with virtually any mood-elevating agent, particularly if given without a mood-stabilizing or other protective agent in vulnerable persons, notably those with known or previously unrecognized bipolar disorders. We suggest risk- or early-warning factors to aid in the timely recognition of such reactions, as well as means of limiting their danger. We also propose that they be considered manifestations of a recognizable cluster of symptoms, in which suicidality is not an isolated phenomenon.

1121,Role of tetrabenazine for Huntington's disease-associated chorea,"Objective: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of tetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington's disease (HD)-associated chorea.; Data Sources: Primary literature and review articles were obtained through a PubMed search (1959-November 2009) using the terms tetrabenazine, HD, chorea, and hyperkinetic movement disorders. A bibliographic search was performed on selected articles.; Study Selection and Data Extraction: All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed. Studies including greater than 10 patients and a direct comparative study with primarily HD-associated chorea were included in the review.; Data Synthesis: Tetrabenazine is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of HD-associated chorea. Tetrabenazine binds reversibly to the type 2 vesicular monoamine transporters and has been shown to inhibit monoamine uptake in presynaptic vesicles, resulting in monoamine depletion. The duration of the antichorea effect of tetrabenazine has been reported to be approximately 5.5 hours. Tetrabenazine is extensively metabolized hepatically by the CYP2D6 enzyme to its primary active metabolite, alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine. The half-life of alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine is 4-8 hours. Clinical trials demonstrated that tetrabenazine reduces chorea, on average, by 5 units based upon the chorea score from the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. The most common adverse effects reported include sedation, drowsiness, parkinsonism, and depression. Rarely, corrected QT interval prolongation, orthostatic hypotension, and hyperprolactinemia have been reported. Tetrabenazine also has a black box warning for increasing the risk of depression and suicidality.; Conclusions: Tetrabenazine can provide significant benefit in the treatment of chorea associated with HD. Given the potential adverse effects of tetrabenazine, health-care providers need to screen patients carefully prior to initiating treatment with this medication. In the future, additional long-term and comparative studies would be useful for further clarification of the role of tetrabenazine in the treatment of HD-associated chorea.;Huntington Disease/*drug therapy, Tetrabenazine/*therapeutic use, Animals, Clinical Trials as Topic/methods, Humans, Huntington Disease/metabolism, Parkinsonian Disorders/chemically induced, Parkinsonian Disorders/metabolism, Sleep Stages/drug effects, Sleep Stages/physiology, Tetrabenazine/adverse effects, Tetrabenazine/chemistry","Poon, Linda H; Kang, Gail A & Lee, Audrey J",0,1121
1122,The Prevalence of Psychiatric Distress and Associated Risk Factors among College Students Using GHQ-28 Questionnaire,"Background: Adolescent and young adults are at increased risk of psychiatric distress and serious disability. We estimated the prevalence and associated risk factors of psychiatric distress among the college students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.; Methods: We performed this cross-sectional study, from Jan to May 2016 at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. Students filled out voluntarily an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, personal information, behavioral risk factors, and a validated Persian version of the GHQ-28 questionnaire, including somatic symptoms (items 1-7), anxiety/insomnia (items 8-14), social dysfunctions (items 15-21), and severe depression (items 22-28).; Results: Of 1259 participants, 518 (41.1%) had psychiatric distress, 166 (13.2%) had heterosexual intercourse, 100 (8.0%) had homosexual intercourse, 204 (16.2%) were smokers (31.6% in males and 6.3% in females), 124 (9.9%) reported a history of using opium/psychedelic substances, 204 (16.2%) reported suicide thought, and 103 (8.2%) had attempted suicide at least once in the past. After adjusting odds ratio (95% CI) for age and sex, psychiatric distress were significantly associated with emotional breakdown 2.67 (2.09, 3.40), heterosexual intercourse 2.56 (1.82, 3.62), homosexual intercourse 2.42 (1.57, 3.71), smoking 3.19 (2.29, 4.45), substance abuse 5.03 (3.26, 7.76), suicide thought 7.81 (5.42, 11.27), suicide attempt 5.64 (3.49, 9.12), uninterested in the discipline 2.29 (1.70, 3.07), and non-optimistic about future 2.16 (1.63, 2.86).; Conclusion: A majority of college students had psychiatric distress and a substantial number of them reported one or more high-risk behaviors that if neglected, may severely impair the students' function and influence their subsequent development and productive lives.; Mental disorders, Smoking, Substance-related disorders, Suicide, Unsafe sex","Poorolajal, Jalal; Ghaleiha, Ali; Darvishi, Nahid; Daryaei, Shahla & Panahi, Soheila",0,1122
1123,Contribution of sleep deprivation to suicidal behaviour: A systematic review,"Sleep disturbances and suicidal behaviour are highly prevalent phenomena, representing with a significant burden to society. Sleep has been acknowledged as a potential biomarker for suicidal behaviour. Over the past decade several studies have explored the association between sleep problems and suicidal behaviour. This area has attracted a growing research interest, hence updated information is needed. We therefore present a wide-scope review of the literature summarizing the most relevant studies on epidemiological and theoretical issues underlying this association. Implications of these findings for clinical practice and future research are discussed. We performed a systematic search of PubMed and Embase databases up to October 2018 to identify studies exploring the association between sleep and suicide. Sixty-five articles met the selection criteria, thus they were included in the review. There was a significant and independent association between sleep disturbances and suicide risk. Psychiatric disorders, sleep deprivation-induced neurocognitive deficits, emotional dysregulation, alterations in circadian rhythms, and negative feelings, among other factors, contributed to this relationship. Sleep loss may lead to higher levels of impulsivity, thus increasing unplanned suicidal behaviour. Sleep disturbances may therefore predict suicidal behaviour, hence becoming a potential therapeutic target.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

1124,Allergy: a risk factor for suicide?,"The rates of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance (suicide risk factors) are greater in patients with allergic rhinitis than in the general population. The rate of allergy is also greater in patients with depression. Preliminary data suggest that patients with a history of allergy may have an increased rate of suicide. Clinicians should actively inquire to diagnose allergy in patients with depression and depression in patients with allergy. Spring peaks of suicide are highly replicated, but their origin is poorly understood. Preliminary epidemiologic data suggest that seasonal spring peaks in aeroallergens are associated with seasonal spring peaks in suicide. Our research in Brown Norway rats demonstrates that sensitization and exposure to aeroallergens induces anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors as well as allergy-related helper T-cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine gene expression in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, it is possible that sensitization and exposure to aeroallergens, which peak in spring, may be conducive to seasonal exacerbation of suicide risk factors such as anxiety, depression, hostility/aggression, and sleep disturbance. Connecting allergy with suicide and suicide risk factors adds to previous neurologic literature connecting allergy with migraines and seizure disorders. Our recent report of Th2 (allergy-mediating) cytokine expression in the orbitofrontal cortex of suicide victims should lead to future studies to test the hypothesis that mediators of allergic inflammation in the nasal cavities may result in Th2 cytokine expression in the brain, influencing affect and behavioral modulation. Certain medications used to treat allergy can exacerbate suicide risk factors, potentially worsening suicide risk and even triggering suicide. Systemic (but not topical) corticosteroids have been associated with manic and depressive episodes and mixed mood states. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration started investigating the possibility that montelukast may trigger suicide. Although this association requires further exploration and confirmation, clinicians should err on the side of caution, inquiring about past suicide attempts; hopelessness; reasons for living; and suicidal ideation, intent, or plan; and referring the patient to a mental health professional for evaluation if appropriate.; ","Postolache, Teodor T.; Komarow, Hirsh & Tonelli, Leonardo H.",0,1124
1125,Care of the clinician after an adverse event,"The past two decades has seen a growing understanding that health care leads to harm in a large number of patients. With this insight has come an understanding that clinicians who care for patients who are harmed experience an understandable and predictable emotional response. After an adverse event, medical care givers may experience a wide range of symptoms including anger, guilt, shame, fear, loneliness, frustration and decreased job satisfaction. These may be accompanied by physical signs of fatigue, sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, tachycardia and hypertension. These clinicians have been referred to as the second victims."" While many clinicians recover relatively quickly from an adverse event for some this syndrome can last for weeks months or indefinitely. Some have even contemplated or completed suicide. Being involved in an adverse event or error may also negatively impact the quality of care the clinician subsequently provides either because of acute emotional distraction or chronic burnout. This can lead to additional errors and a vicious cycle of error burnout and error. Health care systems have a moral responsibility to care for second victims. Care might be as simple as asking ""Are you OK?"" and acknowledging the normal human emotional response to adverse events. Some centers have developed formal peer support programs in which clinicians are trained to act as peer supporter for emotional recovery after adverse events. Finally more formal emotional support systems might be needed by some clinicians including employee assistance programs hospital clergy or psychological and psychiatric services.; Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

1126,Mental health nursing in Greece: Nursing diagnoses and interventions in major depression,"The aim of the study was to assess nursing diagnoses and nursing interventions that were accordingly implemented during the care of inpatients with major depression in Greece. Twelve nurses working in three major psychiatric hospitals were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were used and audio-recorded data indicated that risk for suicide, social isolation, low self-esteem, sleep problems, and imbalanced nutrition are the nursing diagnoses most commonly reported. Establishing trust and rapport is the primary intervention, followed by specific interventions according to each diagnosis and the individualized care plan. The findings of the study also highlight the need for nursing training in order to teach nurses initial assessment procedures and appropriate evidence-based intervention techniques.

1127,The analgesic properties of zolpidem,"Presents a case report of a 64-year-old white woman who carries the diagnoses of bipolar II depression and complex regional pain syndrome. She has been followed at an outpatient clinic for more than 2 years, with stable and baseline depression, without suicidal intent or behavior. The patientâ€™s medication for bipolar disorder has been stabilized on paliperidone, but her principal challenge initially was how to decrease her pain levels. When zolpidem was serendipitously introduced a year later to assist with sleep disturbances, the patient reported that the pain, which had been localized to the right arm, was significantly reduced in severity. The psychiatry resident continued to follow up with the patient on a monthly basis in the outpatient setting, and continued her on the same pharmacotherapy. Due to the added benefit of pain reduction from the zolpidem, the patient started to take more than the prescribed amount. The psychiatrist subsequently referred the patient to a pain management physician and counseled that the side effects of zolpidem warranted a careful adherence to the prescribed dose of the medication. Trazodone was then prescribed for the patient for its sedative properties, and zolpidem was discontinued.

1128,Psychological and Behavioral Issues in the Management of Migraine in Children and Adolescents,"Purpose Of Review: It is sometimes assumed that children and adolescents with migraine have a psychiatric or behavioral comorbidity, a belief that can be stigmatizing. This review will examine the recent literature addressing this area to determine if pediatric and adolescent migraineurs are at increased risk for psychiatric comorbidity and to discuss management strategies.; Recent Findings: A large systematic review of pediatric and adolescent studies concluded anxiety and depression were not associated with onset of recurrent headaches. Children with increasing migraine frequency have reduced school attendance. Pediatric migraineurs have mildly lower quality of life (QOL) scores than healthy peers but not abnormally low. Finally, children with higher migraine frequency as well as migraineurs with aura were more likely to report suicidal ideation. Migraine is a primary neurologic disorder. Migraine and psychiatric disorders may be comorbid; however, at this time, it can be difficult to clearly delineate some migraine features from psychiatric diagnoses with the current screening tools available. The majority of pediatric migraineurs do not have behavioral comorbidities; however, when such comorbidities occur, they should be addressed and appropriately managed. We need more accurate ways of delineating psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities from the migraine phenotype.; Anxiety, Cognitive behavioral therapy, DSM-5, Depression, GAD-7, PHQ-9, Pediatric migraine, Psychiatric comorbidity, Suicide","Qubty, William & Gelfand, Amy A.",0,1128

The Postpartum Depression Screening Scale, Spanish Version was used to assess symptoms of depression. Chilean women (45%) reported depressive symptoms including suicidal thoughts, sleeping/eating disturbances, and emotional stability. Factors that predicted the probability of PPD included attitudes concerning pregnancy, social support, and tobacco use.

1130,The cortisol awakening response and anterior cingulate cortex function in maltreated depressed versus non-maltreated depressed youth,"Symptomatology of depression among children who have (vs. have not) experienced maltreatment is greater in severity, more resistant to conventional treatment, and associated with elevated risk for suicide. Recent evidence implicates perturbations in stress regulatory systems and heightened negative self-appraisals as factors that increase the severity of psychopathology experienced by depressed maltreated (vs. non-maltreated) youth. Likely explanatory mechanisms for these differences are disturbances in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) and persistent negative self-referential biases supported by prefrontal cortex function including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The cortisol awakening response (CAR) and dACC activity during a self-appraisal task were assessed in maltreated and non-maltreated depressed youth. Hierarchical linear models were employed to model the CAR. Maltreatment group, dACC activity during positive and negative self-appraisals as well as other key predictors, were included in the models. Post hoc analyses explored explanations for significant differences. Results indicated that maltreated depressed youth exhibited a higher CAR compared to non-maltreated youth. At low levels of dACC activity during processing of negative self-descriptors maltreated and non-maltreated depressed youth's CAR did not differ. However, at elevated levels of dACC activity during processing of negative self-descriptors maltreated depressed youth exhibited significantly higher CAR compared to non-maltreated depressed youth.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1131,Incident and long-term opioid therapy among patients with psychiatric conditions and medications: A national study of commercial health care claims,"There is growing evidence that opioid prescribing in the United States follows a pattern in which patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes from opioids are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy. These patients include, in particular, those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric conditions. This study examined health insurance claims among 10,311,961 patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Specifically, we evaluated how opioid receipt differed among patients with and without a wide range of preexisting psychiatric and behavioral conditions (ie, opioid and nonopioid SUDs, suicide attempts or other self-injury, motor vehicle crashes, and depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders) and psychoactive medications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and medications used for SUD, tobacco cessation, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Relative to those without, patients with all assessed psychiatric conditions and medications had modestly greater odds of subsequently filling prescriptions for opioids and, in particular, substantially greater risk of long-term opioid receipt. Increases in risk for long-term opioid receipt in adjusted Cox regressions ranged from approximately 1.5-fold for prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication prescriptions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.58) to approximately 3-fold for prior nonopioid SUD diagnoses (HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 3.06-3.24) and nearly 9-fold for prior opioid use disorder diagnoses (HR = 8.70; 95% CI, 8.20-9.24). In sum, we found evidence of greater opioid receipt among commercially insured patients with a breadth of psychiatric conditions. Future studies assessing behavioral outcomes associated with opioid prescribing should consider preexisting psychiatric conditions.

Youth (n = 3292) were assessed with the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths questionnaire. Findings revealed that mental health issues (depression, psychosis) were the most important cofactors of acute suicidal ideation and/or behavior, followed by high-risk behaviors and psychosocial adjustment (nonsuicidal self-injury, harmful behavior, aggression, sleep disruption), and strengths (optimism). Family and caregiver needs were not significant predictors after controlling for other variables. Prevention and outpatient treatment among adolescents should encompass a wide array of individual needs and strengths. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

1133,Mood disorders and complementary and alternative medicine: A literature review,"Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St Johnâ€™s wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.

1134,Sleep Disturbances and Suicidality-A Longitudinal Analysis From a Representative Community Study Over 30 Years,"Study objectives: Associations between sleep problems and suicidality are increasingly acknowledged, but prospective data from well-controlled long-term community studies are lacking. Methods: We analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort study with n = 591 young adults from Zurich, Switzerland, prospectively followed from 1979 (age 20/21 years) to 2008 (age 49/50 years). Twelve-month prevalence of various mental disorders, socio-environmental confounders and sleep problems were carefully assessed with semi-structured interviews at 7 assessment waves spanning overall a 30-year observation period. Interviews were conducted with the Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of the Social Consequences of Psychological Disturbances for Epidemiology"" (SPIKE). The 12-month prevalence of sleep problems was graded according to frequency and associated distress of reported symptoms. 12-month prevalence of suicidality was classified as either mild (transient suicidal ideation) or severe (self-harm suicide attempts). Results: Concurrently and fully adjusted for several covariates including mental disorders relative to no sleep problems there was an odds ratio (OR) of OR = 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.5) OR = 3.3 (2.5-4.4) and OR = 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for mild moderate and severe sleep problems in association with suicidality. There was no evidence for a prospective effect of broad sleep problems on subsequent suicidality. Mild suicidality but not severe suicidality prospectively predicted subsequent broad sleep problems in the fully adjusted multivariate model (adjusted OR = 1.5; 1.1-1.9). Disturbed sleep initiation a proxy for insomnia significantly predicted subsequent suicidality (OR = 1.5; 1.1-1.9) whereas mild suicidality but not severe suicidality significantly predicted subsequent insomnia (OR = 1.5; 1.1-2.0).

1135,Chronic pain and suicide risk: A comprehensive review,"Death by suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Because individuals with chronic pain are at least twice as likely to report suicidal behaviors or to complete suicide, it is of utmost importance to target which risk factors contribute the most to increasing suicidality. This comprehensive review aims to provide an update on research advancements relating to the identification of potential risk factors for suicidality in individuals with chronic pain. Supporting the results of prior reviews, we found robust evidence that chronic pain itself, regardless of type, was an important independent risk factor for suicidality. The only sociodemographic factor found to be associated with suicidality in individuals with chronic pain was being unemployed/disabled. Depressive symptoms, anger problems, harmful habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol misuse, illicit drugs), childhood or adulthood adversities, and family history of depression/suicide were all also identified as general risk factors. Regarding pain-related factors, sleep problems, poorer perceived mental health, concurrent chronic pain conditions, and more frequent episodes of intermittent pain, were all found to be predictors of suicidality. Unexpectedly, pain characteristics (e.g. type, duration, and intensity/severity) and physical status (e.g. pain interference or disability) were not related to suicide risk. We also identified promising new psychosocial factors (e.g. mental defeat, pain catastrophizing, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) associated with suicidality outcomes. A large number of these factors are amenable to change through targeted intervention, highlighting the importance of comprehensively assessing chronic pain patients at risk for suicide, while also incorporating a suicide prevention component into chronic pain management programs.

1136,Predictors of suicidal ideation in chronic pain patients: An exploratory study,"Objectives: To explore whether chronic pain (CP) patients who report suicidal ideation (SI) present a distinctive profile with regard to their sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, psychological well-being, cognitions, and use of antidepressants, illicit drugs, and alcohol for pain relief. Methods: Eighty-eight CP patients completed self-administered questionnaires during their intake assessment at 3 pain clinics located in the province of QuÃ©bec (Canada). Patients reporting active or passive SI on the Beck Depression Inventory were compared with patients reporting no SI. Between-group univariate analyses were performed using profile variables to compare patients with and without SI. Significant variables were then entered into multiple logistic regression analyses to identify significant independent predictors of SI. Results: Twenty-four percent of patients reported having had SI. Unemployed/disabled patients were 6 times more likely to report SI. Poor sleep quality was the only predictor of SI among the physical variables. For psychological well-being, depressive symptoms did not significantly predict SI. However, the poorer the patients perceived their mental health to be the more likely they were to report SI. Pain-related helplessness was the only predictor for SI among the cognitive variables. Patients who had used illicit drugs as a form of pain relief at any time since pain onset were 5 times more likely to report SI. Similar results were obtained for those who were on antidepressants. Discussion: Some factors associated with SI seem pain specific, whereas others are more generally associated with SI. Better identification and understanding of these factors is essential for the development of targeted suicide prevention programs for at-risk CP patients.

1137,Factors associated with suicidal ideation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain,"Objectives: This studyâ€™s aim was to identify the most important general and pain-related risk factors of suicidal ideation in a large sample of patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: A total of 728 patients with chronic non-cancer pain were recruited from the waitlists of eight multidisciplinary pain clinics across Canada. Patients were assessed using self-administered questionnaires to measure demographic, pain-related (intensity, duration, interference, sleep problems), psychological (anxiety, anger, depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation), cognitive (catastrophizing, attitudes/beliefs), and health-related quality of life variables. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors that were associated with presence/absence of suicidal ideation while controlling for depressive symptoms. Results: The results showed that being a male, longer pain duration, higher anger levels, feelings of helplessness, greater pain magnification, and being more depressed were significant independent predictor factors of suicidal ideation, while better perceived mental health was related with a lesser likelihood of suicidal ideation. Moreover, being in a relationship and believing in a medical cure for pain might be protective of suicidal ideation while being anxious may be more associated with suicidal ideation. Conclusions: These results indicate that development of suicidal ideation is more closely related to pain chronicity and certain psychosocial factors than how severe or physically incapacitating the pain is. Many of these factors could potentially be modified by early identification of suicidal ideation and developing targeted cognitive interventions for suicidal at-risk patients. Research to examine the efficacy of these interventions for reducing suicidal ideation is warranted.

1138,Continuous deep sedation until death: Palliation or physician-assisted death?,"Published literature have not discerned end-of-life palliative versus life-shortening effects of pharmacologically maintaining continuous deep sedation until death (i. e., dying in deep sleep) compared with common sedation practices relieving distress in the final conscious phase of dying. Continuous deep sedation predictably suppresses brainstem vital centers and shortens life. Continuous deep sedation remains controversial as palliation for existential suffering and in elective death requests by discontinuation of chronic ventilation or circulatory support with mechanical devices. Continuous deep sedation contravenes the double-effect principle because: (1) it induces permanent coma (intent of action) for the contingency relief of suffering and for social isolation (desired outcomes) and (2) because of its predictable and proportional life-shortening effect. Continuous deep sedation should be distinguished from common sedation practices for palliation and characterized instead as physician-assisted death.

1139,Non-cancer morbidity among Estonian Chernobyl cleanup workers: a register-based cohort study,"Objective: To examine non-cancer morbidity in the Estonian Chernobyl cleanup workers cohort compared with the population sample with special attention to radiation-related diseases and mental health disorders.; Design: Register-based cohort study.; Setting: Estonia.; Participants: An exposed cohort of 3680 men (cleanup workers) and an unexposed cohort of 7631 men (population sample) were followed from 2004 to 2012 through the Population Registry and Health Insurance Fund database.; Methods: Morbidity in the exposed cohort compared with the unexposed controls was estimated in terms of rate ratio (RR) with 95% CIs using Poisson regression models.; Results: Elevated morbidity in the exposed cohort was found for diseases of the nervous system, digestive system, musculoskeletal system, ischaemic heart disease and for external causes. The most salient excess risk was observed for thyroid diseases (RR=1.69; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.07), intentional self-harm (RR=1.47; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.09) and selected alcohol-related diagnoses (RR=1.25; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.39). No increase in morbidity for stress reactions, depression, headaches or sleep disorders was detected.; Conclusions: No obvious excess morbidity consistent with biological effects of radiation was seen in the exposed cohort, with the possible exception of benign thyroid diseases. Increased alcohol-induced morbidity may reflect alcohol abuse, and could underlie some of the higher morbidity rates. Mental disorders in the exposed cohort were probably under-reported. The future challenge will be to study mental and physical comorbidities in the Chernobyl cleanup workers cohort.; Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

1140,Treatment of psychiatric patients with impending suicidal risk,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. Inmost cases, suicide is the consequence of a psychiatric disorder. Assessment of suicide risk is a challenging task which includes a psychopathological evaluation, consideration of socio-demographic and clinical variables, history of previous suicide attempts, and analysis of the psychological context. A high index of suspicion helps to avoid possible pitfalls in the assessment of the suicide risk. Individuals with impending risk of suicide need immediate and intensive psychiatric management. In most cases, admission is advisable. Excitative symptoms, including anxiety, restlessness, agitation, hyperactivity, insomnia, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, rage are the targets of the acute treatment. The psychopharmacological armamentarium is plentiful. Lithium and clozapine are drugs with strong anti-suicidal effectiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1143,Depression worsening associated with lorcaserin: A case report,"Presents the case report of a 39-year-old male patient with major depression disorder (MDD) in remission who was given lorcaserin to treat obesity and subsequently developed severe depressive symptoms. He was suggested by an endocrinologist to take lorcaserin to treat his obesity and potentially improve his diabetes. Eight days later after starting lorcaserin, the patient began to feel depressed and hopeless, experienced insomnia, and lost interest in pleasurable activities. After 2 more weeks, the patient began feeling worse and eventually developed wishes for death. After consultation with his therapist (a psychiatrist), he made the decision to immediately stop the medication, despite losing 8 lbs while taking it. Five days later, he reported a steady improvement in his mood after stopping lorcaserin and that the suicidal wishes had disappeared completely.

1144,Identifying fast-onset antidepressants using rodent models,"Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the burden of suicide. A major limitation of classical antidepressants is that 2â€“4 weeks of continuous treatment is required to elicit therapeutic effects, prolonging the period of depression, disability and suicide risk. Therefore, the development of fast-onset antidepressants is crucial. Preclinical identification of fast-onset antidepressants requires animal models that can accurately predict the delay to therapeutic onset. Although several well-validated assay models exist that predict antidepressant potential, few thoroughly tested animal models exist that can detect therapeutic onset. In this review, we discuss and assess the validity of seven rodent models currently used to assess antidepressant onset: olfactory bulbectomy, chronic mild stress, chronic forced swim test, novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH), novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF), social defeat stress, and learned helplessness. We review the effects of classical antidepressants in these models, as well as six treatments that possess fast-onset antidepressant effects in the clinic: electroconvulsive shock therapy, sleep deprivation, ketamine, scopolamine, GLYX-13 and pindolol used in conjunction with classical antidepressants. We also discuss the effects of several compounds that have yet to be tested in humans but have fast-onset antidepressant-like effects in one or more of these antidepressant onset sensitive models. These compounds include selective serotonin (5-HT)2C receptor antagonists, a 5-HTâ‚„ receptor agonist, a 5-HTâ‚‡ receptor antagonist, NMDA receptor antagonists, a TREK-1 receptor antagonist, mGluR antagonists and (2R,6R)-HNK. Finally, we provide recommendations for identifying fast-onset antidepressants using rodent behavioral models and molecular approaches.

1146,"Managing Acute Insomnia in Prison: Evaluation of a One-Shot"" Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) Intervention""","Objectives/background: Insomnia is a serious condition that affects over 60% of the prison population and has been associated with aggression, anger, impulsivity, suicidality, and increased prison health care use. Nonpharmacological interventions for prison inmates are scarce despite the high prevalence and significant consequences of insomnia among those incarcerated. The aim of the present study was to examine the preliminary efficacy and effectiveness of a one-shot session of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for prison inmates with acute insomnia in an open trial. Method/Participants: The intervention consisted of one 60-70Â min session of CBT-I and a self-management pamphlet. A consecutive series of 30 adult male offenders with acute insomnia from a UK prison completed measures of prospective sleep (daily sleep diary), insomnia symptoms severity (Insomnia Severity Index), and mood symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder) one week before and four weeks after receiving the intervention.; Results: Pairwise t-tests revealed that a single shot of CBT-I was effective in reducing the severity of insomnia in adult male offenders (tÂ =Â [29], 12.65, pÂ <Â 0.001). Further, the results demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes for reductions in depressive (dRMÂ =Â 0.77) and anxious (dRMÂ =Â 0.83) symptoms, as well as insomnia severity (dRMÂ =Â 2.35).; Conclusions: A single-shot session of CBT-I is effective in managing acute insomnia and mood (depression, anxiety) symptoms in adult male prison inmates. Future research should focus on testing if the single-shot CBT-I intervention can be implemented and disseminated in other settings and populations (e.g., female and juvenile or youth offenders).; ","Randall, Charlotte; Nowakowski, Sara & Ellis, Jason G.",1,1146
1147,Modafinil-lnduced Irritability and Aggression? A Report of 2 Bipolar Patients,"Letter to the editor discussing the case of modafinil-induced irritability and aggression in 2 bipolar patients. Mr R.K., a 26-year-old single man diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, with a family history of suicide in a first-degree relative, presented himself at the tertiary care degree psychiatric hospital with complaints of feeling low and decreased interest in work. At the time of presentation, the patient was taking clozapine 100 mg/d and sertraline 50 mg/d. Given the risk of potential manic switch associated with sertraline, it was stopped, and the patient was started on bupropion 150 mg/d. With bupropion, he reported getting easily angry and aggressive, and hence, he stopped it within 3 days; after which, he felt alright. To counter the sedative effect of clozapine, he was prescribed modafinil 100 mg/d with his consent. He reported after another week with complaints of feeling irritable and having difficulty in controlling aggressive outbursts leading to verbal altercations in his office. He had no problems with his sleep, appetite, libido, or personal care. Considering that the patient may be having an impending manic switch, modafinil was stopped, and he was advised to continue clozapine in divided doses. The patient has been doing well for 3 months after stopping modafinil, although the problem of sedation continues. Mr V., diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, presented with complaints of daytime sedation with medications. The patient was on valproate 3500 mg/d with injection zuclopenthixol decanoate 200 mg every 10 days. With his consent, he was started on modafinil 100 mg/d to counter the medication-induced sedation. After 1 week of taking modafinil, the patient started feeling angry with minor events. He felt irritable most of the time. As a result modafinil was stopped. The problem of sedation continued, which subsequently led to his valproate dose being reduced gradually to 2500 mg/d and injection zuclopenthixol decanoate 200 mg being spaced out to be administered every 15 days over the next 2 months. The sedation has come down since then without relapse of manic symptoms.

Follow-up clinical assessments were conducted 7.0 +/- 0.5 years later in 94% of the original cohort. Although initial group comparisons failed to show significant differences in biologic measures, analyses incorporating clinical follow-up reveal that changes in sleep and cortisol measures are associated with differential longitudinal course. Normal controls who would develop depression after the biologic studies had shown significantly higher density of rapid eye movements (REM) and a trend for reduced REM latency compared to controls with no psychiatric disorder at follow-up.

Materials and Methods: In a randomized, double-masked, 14-week, 2-period, crossover study, patients with painful DPN using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for nonâ€“DPN-related pain received 150 to 300 mg/d pregabalin or placebo (period 1); 14-day washout; then, the opposite therapy (period 2). Endpoints included weekly change in DPN pain score, sleep interference, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes. Results: Patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomized (period 1) to 1 of the 2 following possible sequences: pregabalinâ†’placebo (n = 154) or placeboâ†’pregabalin (n = 147). Results of the primary efficacy measure, mean weekly DPN pain at endpoint, showed no significant difference between pregabalin and placebo. However, 1 sensitivity analysis (mixed-model repeated measures) found greater pain score reductions with pregabalin than placebo at weeks 2 to 4 and overall (all P < 0.05). One secondary endpoint analysis, mean treatment difference in DPN-related sleep interference, favored pregabalin over placebo (P = 0.0009). Other sensitivity and secondary analyses were nonsignificant. Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of pregabalin. Discussion: Pregabalin (vs. placebo) showed overall improvements in sleep, pain reduction in 1 sensitivity analysis, and was well tolerated. Potential factors that may have confounded the ability to detect a treatment difference in DPN pain reduction (high placebo response, carryover effect, short washout period, or pregabalin dose) are discussed in the context of future studies.

1151,A randomized controlled trial of ganaxolone in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Preclinical and clinical research supports a role for neuroactive steroids in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We investigated ganaxolone (a synthetic 3Î²-methylated derivative of allopregnanolone, a GABAergic neuroactive steroid) for treatment of PTSD in a proof-of-concept, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Veteran and non-veteran participants (n = 112) were randomized to ganaxolone or placebo at biweekly escalating doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. During an open-label 6-week extension phase, the initial ganaxolone group continued ganaxolone, while the placebo group crossed over to ganaxolone. Eighty-six and 59 participants, respectively, completed the placebo-controlled and open-label phases. A modified intent-to-treat mixed model repeated measures analysis revealed no significant differences between the effects of ganaxolone and placebo on Clinician Administered PTSD Symptom (CAPS) scores, global well-being, negative mood, or sleep. Dropout rates did not differ between groups, and ganaxolone was generally well tolerated. Trough blood levels of ganaxolone at the end of the double-blind phase were, however, lower than the anticipated therapeutic level of ganaxolone in > 35% of participants on active drug. Pharmacokinetic profiling of the ganaxolone dose regimen used in the trial and adverse event sensitivity analyses suggest that under-dosing may have contributed to the failure of ganaxolone to out-perform placebo. Future investigations of ganaxolone may benefit from higher dosing, rigorous monitoring of dosing adherence, a longer length of placebo-controlled testing, and targeting of treatment to PTSD subpopulations with demonstrably dysregulated pre-treatment neuroactive steroid levels.

Thus, the study aimed to study the prevalence of burn out and its correlates among interns and residents at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.; Settings and Design: Cross Sectional Study at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.; Methods: It was a cross Sectional study of 558 interns and residents of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Data was collected which included the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory [CBI]which assesses burnout in the dimensions of Personal burnout, Work burnout and Patient related burnout, with a cut off score of 50 for each dimension. Age, sex, year of study, department the resident belonged to, or an intern, junior resident or a super speciality senior resident (resident doing super speciality course after their post graduate masters degree) were the correlates assessed.; Statistical Analysis: Univariate analysis.; Results: More than one third of the participants were found to have burnout in one or another dimension of the CBI. Burnout was found to be the highest among the interns in the domains of personal burnout (64.05 %) and patient related burnout (68.62 %) and in junior residents for work related burnout (40%). Super specialty senior residents had the least prevalence of burnout in all three dimensions. Among the residents, Non Medical/Non Surgical residents had the least prevalence of burnout in all three dimensions, whereas surgical speciality residents had the highest of personal burnout (57.92 %) and Medical speciality residents had the highest patient related burnout (27.13%). Both medical and surgical specialty residents had equal prevalence of work burnout. The study also showed that as the number of years of residency increased, the burnout also increased in all three dimensions.

The aims of this study were to describe the topography of challenging behaviours in a cohort of 106 young adults with ASD and to identify the risk factors for challenging behaviours. Our secondary objective was to study the changes in challenging behaviours from adolescence to early adult years.; Method: The present study uses data from the EpiTED prospective follow-up study in France. The presence of challenging behaviours was assessed by the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) completed by parent informants. Several dimensions of behaviour were studied: irritability, stereotypy, lethargy, hyperactivity and self-injury. Clinical variables were collected on ASD symptom severity, cognitive and language levels, adaptive behaviours and comorbid medical disorders.; Results: The presence of challenging behaviours at early adulthood was related to the young adult's cognitive and language level, ASD symptom severity and comorbid gastrointestinal and sleep disorders. The main risk factor for challenging behaviours was ASD symptom severity. The level of language impairment was a significant predictor of self-injury. Gastrointestinal disorders were a significant predictor of stereotypy. The change in behaviour topography from adolescence to early adult years corresponded with decreased parent report of hyperactivity, but no significant decrease in parent reports of irritability, stereotypy, lethargy and self-injurious behaviours.; Conclusions: The challenging behaviours in individuals with ASD persist in early adulthood and are related to core symptom severity, levels of cognitive and language impairments and medical comorbidity. The results emphasise the importance of early interventions for children with ASD to target cognitive and language abilities and to alleviate the severity of ASD symptoms. They also underscore the need to enhance opportunities for individuals with ASD to better communicate discomforts and pain in the context of medical illness.; Â© 2018 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Autism spectrum disorders, Challenging behaviours, EpiTED cohort, Self-injurious behaviours, Young adult","Rattaz, C.; Michelon, C.; Munir, K. & Baghdadli, A.",0,1153
1154,Are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors safe for drivers? What is the evidence?,"Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used medications to treat several psychiatric diseases and, above all, depression. They seem to be as effective as older antidepressants but have a different adverse effect profile. Despite their favorable safety profile, little is known about their influence on traffic safety.; Objective: To conduct a literature review to summarize the current evidence on the role of SSRIs in traffic safety, particularly concerning undesirable effects that could potentially impair fitness to drive, experimental and pharmacoepidemiologic studies on driving impairment, 2 existing categorization systems for driving-impairing medications, and the European legislative procedures for assessing fitness to drive before issuing a driver's license and driving under the influence of medicines.; Methods: The article search was performed in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and SafetyLit. The English-language scientific literature was searched using key words such as SSRIs and psychomotor performance, car crash or traffic accident, and adverse effects. For inclusion in this review, papers had to be full-text articles, refer to possible driving-related adverse effects, and be experimental or pharmacoepidemiologic studies on SSRIs and traffic accident risks. No restrictions concerning publication year were applied.; Results: Ten articles were selected as background information on driving-related adverse effects, and 15 articles were selected regarding experimental and pharmacoepidemiologic work. Regarding SSRI adverse effects, the most reported undesirable effects referring to driving impairment were anxiety, agitation, sleep disturbances, headache, increased risk of suicidal behavior, and deliberate self-harm. Regarding the remaining issues addressed in this article, inconsistencies were found between the outcomes of the selected experimental and epidemiologic studies and between the 2 existing categorization systems under evaluation. Some pitfalls of the current legislative scenario were identified as well.; Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, it was concluded that more experimental and epidemiologic research is needed to elucidate the relationship between SSRI use and traffic safety. Furthermore, a revision of the existing categorization systems and harmonized European legislation in the field of medication use and driving were highly recommended.; Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

1155,Translational attention: From experiments in the lab to helping the symptoms of individuals with Tourettes syndrome,"This paper attempts focuses on the neurodevelopmental motor disorder of Touretteâ€™s Syndrome (TS). which is part of a spectrum of motor impairments, ranging from simple transient motor tics to chronic debilitating symptoms, and which affect 0.5-24% of school aged children around the world. Individuals with TS often have difficulty with executive functions, a term comprising a number of cognitive and behavioral constructs that include mental tracking, sustained attention, working memory, planning and organization, goal directedness, cognitive flexibility during problem solving, impulse control and self regulation. Childhood motor disorders, including TS, are more widespread than is commonly acknowledged. The clinical hallmark of TS is the presence of motor or phonic tics, repetitive, stereotyped motions or vocalizations. Motor tics range from simple motions, such as blinking or shoulder shrugging, to more complicated motions, such as jumping, and kicking. Phonic tics range from simple squeaking or grunting sounds to echoing and, more rarely, cursing. The combination of TS with any comorbidity increases the risk of problems such as anger management, self injurious behavior and sleep disorders. Thus, the management of TS is of critical concern to healthcare professionals.

1156,"Pregnancy associated death in record linkage studies relative to delivery, termination of pregnancy, and natural losses: A systematic review with a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis","Objectives: Measures of pregnancy associated deaths provide important guidance for public health initiatives. Record linkage studies have significantly improved identification of deaths associated with childbirth but relatively few have also examined deaths associated with pregnancy loss even though higher rates of maternal death have been associated with the latter. Following PRISMA guidelines we undertook a systematic review of record linkage studies examining the relative mortality risks associated with pregnancy loss to develop a narrative synthesis, a meta-analysis, and to identify research opportunities.; Methods: MEDLINE and SCOPUS were searched in July 2015 using combinations of: mortality, maternal death, record linkage, linked records, pregnancy associated mortality, and pregnancy associated death to identify papers using linkage of death certificates to independent records identifying pregnancy outcomes. Additional studies were identified by examining all citations for relevant studies.; Results: Of 989 studies, 11 studies from three countries reported mortality rates associated with termination of pregnancy, miscarriage or failed pregnancy. Within a year of their pregnancy outcomes, women experiencing a pregnancy loss are over twice as likely to die compared to women giving birth. The heightened risk is apparent within 180â€‰days and remains elevated for many years. There is a dose effect, with exposure to each pregnancy loss associated with increasing risk of death. Higher rates of death from suicide, accidents, homicide and some natural causes, such as circulatory diseases, may be from elevated stress and risk taking behaviors.; Conclusions: Both miscarriage and termination of pregnancy are markers for reduced life expectancy. This association should inform research and new public health initiatives including screening and interventions for patients exhibiting known risk factors.; Maternal mortality, abortion, health policy, longevity, miscarriage, pregnancy associated death, pregnancy loss, pregnancy screening, risk factors, termination of pregnancy","Reardon, David C. & Thorp, John M.",0,1156
1157,"Caring for Syrian refugees in Portland, Oregon","This article discuses about the caring for Syrian refugees in Portland, Oregon. 'Ms.A' is a 34-year-old married Syrian woman who came to the Oregon Muslim Medical Associationâ€™s free mental health clinic for Muslims by Muslims in 2015 for symptoms of depression. Ms. A reports that she has been struggling with depressed mood, poor appetite, significant weight loss, poor sleep, inability to focus, a motivation, frequent crying spells, and poor energy. She has daily nightmares about the traumatic memories of war and her forced emigration. She denies suicidal ideation, and reports that she continues to be a caring and involved mother despite her severe symptoms. Ms. A and her children have continued to struggle since coming to the United States and navigating a new country, culture, and language. Through the support of the Oregon Muslim Medical Association clinic and the Portland Refugee Support Group, our team has established a comprehensive approach to refugee trauma that has been very helpful to Ms. A and others like her, and it is one that we hope will continue to fill crucial gaps in delivering the best standards of care to this underserved and at-risk population.

1159,Prevalence and risk factors of video game dependency in adolescence: Results of a German nationwide survey,"In this article, results of a German nationwide survey (KFN schools survey 2007/2008) are presented. The controlled sample of 44,610 male and female ninth-graders was carried out in 2007 and 2008 by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony (KFN). According to a newly developed screening instrument (KFNCSAS- II), which was presented to every third juvenile participant (N = 15,168), 3% of the male and 0.3% of the female students are diagnosed as dependent on video games. The data indicate a clear dividing line between extensive gaming and video game dependency (VGD) as a clinically relevant phenomenon. VGD is accompanied by increased levels of psychological and social stress in the form of lower school achievement, increased truancy, reduced sleep time, limited leisure activities, and increased thoughts of committing suicide. In addition, it becomes evident that personal risk factors are crucial for VGD. The findings indicate the necessity of additional research as well as the respective measures in the field of health care policies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

The relationship between MAO activity and a measure of seasonal variation in sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite, and energy level was examined for 49 patients with SAD, 11 patients with subsyndromal SAD, and 25 normal volunteers. Data indicate significantly higher levels of platelet MAO activity in females. MAO activity (whether high or low) was not associated with a significant increase in risk of SAD or of developing hypersomnia, hyperphagia, or carbohydrate craving during episodes of winter depression. Ss who had made suicide attempts during an episode of SAD had significantly lower mean levels of platelet MAO activity than other Ss.

1161,Prevalences and correlates of sleep problems among adolescents in specialty mental health services and in the community: what differs?,"Aims: Knowledge of sleep problems and their relationships among adolescent psychiatric patients is limited. This study investigated whether adolescents in specialty mental health care differ in rate and correlates of sleep problems from adolescents in a community sample; 2465 adolescents from a community sample were compared with a representative clinical sample of 129 adolescent patients.; Methods: Comparisons were made on frequent sleep problems according to scores on the Youth Self-Report, the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and instruments assessing coping styles, stresses and family functioning.; Results: Sleep problems were more frequent in the clinical sample than the community sample (31.3% vs. 5%). Sleeping little and being overtired were the most common sleep problems. Sleep problems were multivariately associated with internalizing problems in both samples. Poor family functioning and distractive coping were multivariately associated with sleep problems among adolescent patients, whereas depressive symptoms were multivariately associated in community adolescents.; Conclusions: Prevalences of sleep problems were high among adolescent patients. However, sleep problems may be in danger of being unnoticed in clinical practice. Clinicians should ask about such problems and be aware of possible connections with family functioning, depression and suicidality.

1162,"Safety and efficacy of pridopidine in patients with Huntington's disease (PRIDE-HD): a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging study","Background: Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.; Methods: PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged â‰¥21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] â‰¥25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score â‰¤90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67Â·5, 90, or 112Â·5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02006472).; Findings: Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67Â·5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112Â·5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67Â·5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112Â·5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n=4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112Â·5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.; Interpretation: Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.; Funding: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.; Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

1163,A randomized placebo-controlled trial of varenicline for smoking cessation allowing flexible quit dates,"Introduction: Current smoking cessation guidelines recommend setting a quit date prior to starting pharmacotherapy. However, providing flexibility in the date of quitting may be more acceptable to some smokers. The objective of this study was to compare varenicline 1 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) with placebo in subjects using a flexible quit date paradigm after starting medication. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled international study, smokers of â‰¥10 cigarettes/day, aged 18-75 years, and who were motivated to quit were randomized (3:1) to receive varenicline 1 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects were followed up through Week 24. Subjects were instructed to quit between Days 8 and 35 after starting medication. The primary endpoint was carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence during Weeks 9-12, and a key secondary endpoint was continuous abstinence during Weeks 9-24. Results: Overall, 493 subjects were randomized to varenicline and 166 to placebo. Continuous abstinence was higher for varenicline than for placebo subjects at the end of treatment (Weeks 9-12: 53.1% vs. 19.3%; odds ratio [OR] 5.9; 95% CI, 3.7-9.4; p < .0001) and through 24 weeks follow-up (Weeks 9-24: 34.7% vs. 12.7%; OR 4.4; 95% CI, 2.6-7.5; p < .0001). Serious adverse events occurred in 1.2% varenicline (none were psychiatric) and 0.6% placebo subjects. Fewer varenicline than placebo subjects reported depression-related adverse events (2.3% vs. 6.7%, respectively). Conclusions: Varenicline 1 mg b.i.d. using a flexible quit date paradigm had similar efficacy and safety compared with previous fixed quit date studies.

1164,Evaluation of cholesterol as a biomarker for suicidality in a veteran sample,"A reduction in total cholesterol may alter the microviscosity of the braincell- membrane, reducing serotonin receptor exposure. The resulting imbalance between serotonin and dopamine may lead to an increased risk for suicidality. The objective of this research was to evaluate total cholesterol as a biological marker for suicidality in a sample of US military veterans. The study population consisted of veterans who received care at the Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) and were included in the Suicide Prevention Coordinatorâ€™s database for having suicidal ideation with evidence of escalating intent, a documented suicide attempt, or committed suicide between 2009 and 2015. The veteransâ€™ medical data were obtained from the facilityâ€™s computerized patient record system. The final sample was 188 observations from 128 unique veterans. Veterans with total cholesterol levels below 168 mg/dl appeared to have a higher suicide risk than those with higher levels. The cholesterol levels of veterans reporting suicidal ideation or attempt were significantly lower than the group reporting neither [F(2, 185) = 30.19, p < .001]. When data from multiple visits were available, veterans reporting suicidal ideation or attempt had experienced a significant (20%) decrease in cholesterol levels from an earlier visit in which they did not report suicidality. A latent class analysis revealed that among other differences, suicidal veterans were younger, leaner, and had more anxiety, sleep problems, and higher education than those being seen for an issue unrelated to suicidality.

1165,Treatment of major depression in later life: a life cycle perspective,"The goal of this article is to provide a life-cycle perspective on the treatment of major depressive episodes in later life. Our studies have suggested that older patients appear to benefit as much, though perhaps more slowly, than mid-life patients from acute combined treatment (nortriptyline+interpersonal psychotherapy) of major depression. Given also the apparently higher relapse rate among the elderly, however, continuation treatment needs to be vigorous and closely monitored. The occurrence of severe life events prior to the index episode and the co-existence of an anxiety disorder both appear to prolong treatment response times, while chronic medical burden per se neither compromises response rates nor prolongs time to response. Self-rated perception of health improves with remission of depression in the elderly. As in mid-life patients, both antidepressant medication (nortriptyline) and interpersonal psychotherapy appear to possess chronic efficacy with respect to the prevention of recurrent episodes and prolongation of wellness. Finally, treatment of depression in the elderly results in improved quality of life, especially in domains of well being and coping. Particular challenges in the treatment of elderly patients are noncompliance and the prevention of suicide. The latter is closely linked to feelings of hopelessness, and these may be persistent in some patients.;Psychotherapy*/methods, Psychotherapy*/standards, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depression/*therapy, Geriatric Psychiatry/*methods, Nortriptyline/*therapeutic use, Aged, Anxiety/complications, Bereavement, Clinical Trials as Topic, Combined Modality Therapy/standards, Depression/complications, Depression/prevention & control, Health Status, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Life Change Events, Patient Compliance, Prognosis, Quality of Life, Recurrence, Risk Factors, Sleep/physiology, Suicide/psychology, Treatment Outcome","Reynolds, C F, 3rd",0,1165
1166,Chronic depression in the elderly: approaches for prevention,"Depression in old age frequently follows a chronic and/or relapsing course, related to medical comorbidity, cognitive impairment and depletion of psychosocial resources. As endorsed by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Late Life Depression, a major goal of treatment is to prevent relapse, recurrence and chronicity. We believe that most, if not all, elderly patients with major depressive episodes are appropriate candidates for maintenance therapy, because of the vulnerability to relapse and recurrence and because of the favourable benefit to risk ratio of available treatments. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of this therapeutic goal, but psychosocial approaches (especially interpersonal psychotherapy) have also been shown to contribute significantly to prevention of a chronic depressive illness and to prevention of the disability that attends depression. Studies published to date have established the long term or maintenance efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline. Current, ongoing studies are addressing the maintenance efficacy of paroxetine and citalopram to prolong recovery in depression associated with old age. These studies are focusing particularly on patients aged 70 years and above, who are at high risk of recurrence, and on patients in primary care settings, where under-recognition and under-treatment of depression in the elderly have been costly from a public health perspective in terms of increased medical utilisation, burden to patients and families, and high rates of suicide. Depression in old age is a major contributor to the global burden of illness-related disability, but it is extremely treatable if appropriate pharmacotherapy is prescribed and accepted by patients and their caregivers.; Depression/*prevention & control, Aged, Chronic Disease, Depression/therapy, Humans, Public Health","Reynolds, C F, 3rd; Alexopoulos, G.

Methods: Adults over age 55 with primary insomnia were randomly assigned to six weeks of double-blind treatment with paroxetine (N=14) or placebo (N=13). Outcome measures included persistence or resolution of insomnia; weekly diary measures of sleep quality, daytime alertness, and mood; and pre-/postpolysomnographic measures of sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. Results: Although weekly diary-based measures showed improved subjective sleep quality, daytime alertness, and mood with paroxetine, the authors observed no effect on sleep efficiency or categorical response rates. Conclusion: Paroxetine appears to be ineffective for treating primary insomnia in old age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1168,Self-immolation a predictable method of suicide: a comparison study of warning signs for suicide by self-immolation and by self-poisoning,"Objective: Understanding warning signs for suicide is a crucial aspect of suicide prevention. This study was designed to compare warning signs prior to suicide attempt by self-immolation versus suicide attempt by self-poisoning among consecutive referrals for treatment after suicide-attempt at Kermanshah Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran.; Methods: Over a 4-month period (June-September 2008), first degree relatives of 200 consecutive patients referred to Kermanshah Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran, following a suicide attempt were interviewed. Sixty-three patients had attempted suicide by self-immolation and 137 by self-poisoning. Interviews addressed demographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, and educational status) and three sets of psychosocial warning signs for suicide (verbal, behavioral, and environmental).; Results: Four significant differences in types of warning signs were found between the two groups. Those patients who had attempted suicide by self-poisoning were more likely to have shown seeking behavior for killing devices prior to the suicide (p<0.001), to have shown depressed mood and severe changes in mood (p<0.01), to have shown a lack of interest in work and education (p<0.02), and to have shown reckless behaviors (p<0.01). Other symptoms were not significantly different between the groups. Analyses considering warning signs in clusters of behavior patterns (verbal, behavioral, and environmental warning signs) indicated behavioral warning signs were more common in patients who had attempted suicide by self-poisoning. Further, the total number of warning behaviors was greater in the self-poisoning group (p<0.001), indicating that the group who attempted suicide by self-poisoning seemed to do so with more substantial planning and warning than those who attempted suicide by self-immolation.; Conclusion: Warning signs for suicide by self-immolation were different and fewer than warning signs for suicide by self-poisoning among this sample of 200 Iranian patients who had attempted suicide. Prediction and prevention of suicide by self-immolation may be more difficult than prevention of suicide by other methods.; Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

A comparison of Iranian patients attempting suicide by self-immolation and by poisoning,"Objective: Patients who attempted suicide by self-immolation were compared to patients who attempted suicide by poisoning to identify features that might discriminate risk of self-immolation from other suicide methods.; Methods: Consecutive referrals for attempted suicide were recruited over a 4-month period (June-September 2008) from Kermanshah Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran. Using questionnaire and interview techniques, demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education level), psychosocial risk factors (prior suicide attempt, family history of suicide attempt, previous history of physical and mental disorders, family/marital conflict), and suicidal intent behavior were assessed from 200 patients who had attempted suicide (n = 63 by self-immolation; n = 137 by poisoning).; Results: Several significant differences between the groups emerged. Patients who had attempted suicide by self-immolation were more frequently female (p < 0.001), older (p < 0.007), less educated (p < 0.001), and married (p < 0.001). Suicidal intent was associated with increased risk of suicide by poisoning (p < 0.001).

1170,An empirically based approach to the assessment and management of suicidal behavior,"Accurate assessment and management of risk is crucial to the prevention of suicidal behavior. In the present article, the interpersonal theory of suicide (T. E. Joiner, 2005, Why people die by suicide, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; K. A. Van Orden, et al., 2010, The interpersonal theory of suicide, Psychological Review, 117, 575-600) is used as the main backdrop for conceptualizing targets for suicide risk assessment and attendant management strategies. In addition to providing an overview of the theory and its corroborating empirical evidence, we discuss its tenets in relation to three other leading theories of suicidal behavior. The shared features and unique strengths of the empirical approaches are noted. Following this, leading risk factors for imminent suicidal behavior are discussed and possible links to existing empirical perspectives are highlighted. In particular, evidence is reviewed for marked social withdrawal and key indicators of overarousal (namely, agitation, nightmares, and insomnia). We offer recommendations for appropriate empirically based assessment and intervention strategies and close with a discussion of future directions for research.

1171,Sleep problems outperform depression and hopelessness as cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation and behavior in young adults in the military,"Background: Sleep problems appear to represent an underappreciated and important warning sign and risk factor for suicidal behaviors. Given past research indicating that disturbed sleep may confer such risk independent of depressed mood, in the present report we compared self-reported insomnia symptoms to several more traditional, well-established suicide risk factors: depression severity, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis, as well as anxiety, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse symptoms. Methods: Using multiple regression, we examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation and behavior, controlling for depressive symptom severity, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis, anxiety symptoms, and drug and alcohol abuse symptoms in a sample of military personnel (N = 311). Results: In support of a priori hypotheses, self-reported insomnia symptoms were cross-sectionally associated with suicidal ideation, even after accounting for symptoms of depression, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis, anxiety symptoms and drug and alcohol abuse. Self-reported insomnia symptoms also predicted suicide attempts prospectively at one-month follow up at the level of a non-significant trend, when controlling for baseline self-reported insomnia symptoms, depression, hopelessness, PTSD diagnosis and anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse symptoms. Insomnia symptoms were unique predictors of suicide attempt longitudinally when only baseline self-reported insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms and hopelessness were controlled. Limitations: The assessment of insomnia symptoms consisted of only three self-report items. Findings may not generalize outside of populations at severe suicide risk. Conclusions: These findings suggest that insomnia symptoms may be an important target for suicide risk assessment and the treatment development of interventions to prevent suicide.

1172,Overarousal interacts with a sense of fearlessness about death to predict suicide risk in a sample of clinical outpatients,"Converging evidence suggests that acute states of overarousal are common prior to suicidal behavior. Yet, there has been very little theory-driven research of these phenomena. We consider two competing theoretical perspectives. The first is consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide, which suggests that the prospect of engaging in lethal suicidal behavior should elicit some degree of arousal; however, the effect of arousal will be particularly relevant when considered in the context of an individual's capability for suicide. The second perspective draws from escape-based models, which would suggest that arousal alone should result in increased suicide risk, given the distress associated with high arousal states. Results indicated that the interaction of overarousal and capability for suicide was associated with suicidal symptoms. As overarousal increased, suicidal symptoms increased among high capability individuals and decreased among low capability individuals. These effects were observed beyond the effects of depression, anxiety, age, gender, and marital status. There was no significant main effect of overarousal. Results support a perspective in line with the interpersonal theory, suggesting that overarousal states may be particularly dangerous for individuals who have developed the capability for suicide.

1173,Capability for suicide interacts with states of heightened arousal to predict death by suicide beyond the effects of depression and hopelessness,"Background: States of heightened arousal (e.g., agitation, sleep disturbance) have been repeatedly linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, including attempts and death. Studies have further indicated that these states may be particularly pernicious among individuals who evidence high suicidal capability. The objective of this study was to examine the interactive effects of heightened arousal and the capability for suicide in the prospective prediction of death by suicide. We examine this relation beyond the effects of robust predictors of suicide, namely depression and hopelessness. Methods: Participants were drawn from a larger study of undergraduates who completed baseline assessments during their freshman year and were then followed to time of death. The sample in this study only included individuals who had died by suicide (n = 96) or other causes (n = 542). Proxy measures to assess predictor variables were constructed using items from the MMPI, which was administered at baseline. An independent sample of clinical outpatients (n = was used to evaluate the construct validity of the proxy measures). Results: Results were in line with expectation: heightened arousal interacted with capability for suicide to prospectively predict death by suicide, such that, as severity of heightened arousal symptoms increased, the likelihood of death by suicide increased among individuals high but not low on capability for suicide. Limitations: Limitations include the use of proxy measures, the extended length of follow-up, and the homogeneity of the sample (i.e., primarily White males). Conclusion: These findings add to an emerging literature that supports the moderating influence of capability for suicide on the relationship between states of heightened arousal on the likelihood of death by suicide.

1174,The Link between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Functionality among United States Military Service Members Psychiatrically Hospitalized Following a Suicide Crisis,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders in the United States and has been linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, yet the role of a PTSD diagnosis on functional impairment among suicidal individuals remains unknown. This study examined the association between PTSD status and functional impairment among military psychiatric inpatients admitted for acute suicide risk (N = 166) with a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt. Measures of functionality included: (1) alcohol use; (2) sleep quality; (3) social problem-solving; and (4) work and social adjustment. Thirty-eight percent of the sample met criteria for PTSD. Women were more likely than men to meet criteria for PTSD (p = 0.007), and participants who met PTSD criteria had significantly more psychiatric diagnoses (p < 0.001). Service members who met PTSD criteria reported more disturbed sleep (p = 0.003) and greater difficulties with work and social adjustment (p = 0.004) than those who did not meet PTSD criteria. However, functionality measures were not significantly associated with PTSD status after controlling for gender and psychiatric comorbidity. Gender and number of psychiatric comorbidities other than PTSD were significant predictors of PTSD in logistic regression models across four functionality measures. Future studies should assess the additive or mediating effect of psychiatric comorbidities in the association between impaired functioning and PTSD. Clinicians are encouraged to assess and address functionality during treatment with suicidal individuals, paying particular attention to individuals with multiple psychiatric diagnoses.; PTSD, comorbidity, functionality, inpatient, military, suicide","Ribeiro, Sissi Palma; LaCroix, Jessica M.; De Oliveira, Fernanda; Novak, Laura A.; Lee-Tauler, Su Yeon; Darmour, Charles A.; Perera, Kanchana U.; Goldston, David B.; Weaver, Jennifer; Soumoff, Alyssa & Ghahramanlou-Holloway, Marjan",1,1174
1175,Fugue states in sleep and wakefulness: a psychophysiological study,"A patient's refusal to participate in recommended treatment is a problem faced in all branches of medicine. However, psychiatry faces special problems because of its authority to impose hospitalization and treatment on unwilling patients. Nowhere is this more poignant than in the treatment of patients exhibiting suicidal behavior where the potential for imminent self-destruction exists. As part of a prospective study to develop utilization review standards for the hospitalization of suicide attempters, cases were identified where there was independent agreement between both the experts' standards and the treating resident psychiatrists that hospitalization was required. Despite this agreement, the patients were not hospitalized because the patients refused. By most criteria, these patients were a high risk group. They had made repeated suicide attempts, used lethal means which eventuated in serious medical consequences, and were still suicidal when referred for treatment. The emergency room psychiatrists reported feeling confused, anxious, and annoyed in dealing with these patients, and the patients signed out against medical advice. A review of these cases indicates that discussions of social control vs. medical responsibility and clear criteria for hospitalization should be incorporated into residency training programs since the emergency room resident faces these tension-producing issues frequently with several different types of patients. Moreover, utilization review criteria may help to set standards which will assist the psychiatrist in making these difficult decisions.;Sleep*, Wakefulness*, Dissociative Disorders/*physiopathology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Sleep Stages, Sleep, REM, Time Factors","Rice, E & Fisher, C",0,1175
1176,Point-prevalence of depression and associated risk factors,"The study aimed to assess levels of depressive symptoms and associated risk factors in a sample of students in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. A convenient sample (N = 254) of students at the University Antonio NariÃ±o, BogotÃ¡ was invited to complete an online survey that contained questions associated with common risk factors for depression and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Chi-square was used to analyze comparisons between demographic and risk factors and severity of depression, and comparisons between those depressed and not depressed. Odds Ratios and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were computed through logistic regression model developed for each independent variable. The point-prevalence of current depressive symptoms was 36.2%; women 47.3% and men 21.3%. Risk factors associated with depression included being a woman, having a previous diagnosis, suicidal ideation and (or) intent, sleep problems, a recent loss, and a history of family depression and alcoholism. The study confirms the high incidence of depression and associated risk factors in students. The results demonstrate a need for prevention measures, early detection and early intervention.

1177,Factor structure of the PHQ-9 screen for depression across time since injury among persons with spinal cord injury,"Objective: The overlap of somatic-depressive symptoms and physical sequelae of spinal cord injury (SCI) has raised concerns regarding the validity of depression screens used within the SCI population. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) measure parallels Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria of major depression. The authors investigated PHQ-9 factor structure among persons with SCI at various times postinjury. Design: Data from 2,570 participants at 1 year (N = 682), 5 years (N = 517), 15 years (N = 653), and 25 years (N = 718) postinjury were used. Emergent factors were correlated with satisfaction with life. Results: A 2-factor solution emerged for all groups, with 3 affective referenced items (feeling depressed/hopeless, feeling bad about self/failure, and suicidal ideation) and 3 somatic referenced items (sleep disturbance, low energy/fatigue, and appetite disturbance) loading consistently on Affective and Somatic factors, respectively, at all time points. Factor scores negatively correlated with satisfaction with life. Conclusions: Dual factor structure of the PHQ-9 is present at various times postinjury in the SCI population. It remains unclear whether somatic item endorsement reflects depressive symptomatology per se; however, endorsement is still associated with satisfaction with life.

1178,"Insomnia, psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation in a National Representative Sample of active Canadian Forces members","Background: Past research on the association between insomnia and suicidal ideation (SI) has produced mixed findings. The current study explored the relationship between insomnia, SI, and past-year mental health status among a large Canadian Forces (CF) sample. Method: Data was obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey (CFMHS), and included a large representative sample of Canadian Regular Forces personnel (N = 6700). A series of univariate logistic regressions were conducted to test individual associations between past-year mental health status, insomnia, and potential confounds and SI. Mental health status included three groups: 0, 1, or two or more probable diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD) and alcohol abuse/dependence. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between insomnia and SI with mental health status as a moderator. Results: 40.8% of respondents reported experiencing insomnia. Both insomnia and number of mental health conditions incrementally increased the risk of SI. However, past-year mental health status was a significant moderator of this relationship, such that for CF personnel with either no (AOR = 1.61, 1.37â€“1.89) or only one past-year mental health condition (AOR = 1.39, 1.12â€“1.73), an incremental increase in insomnia was associated with an increased likelihood of SI. However, in personnel with two or more past-year mental health disorders, insomnia was no longer significantly associated with SI (AOR = 1.04, 0.81â€“1.33). Conclusions: Insomnia significantly increased the odds of SI, but only among individuals with no or one mental health condition. Findings highlight the importance of assessing insomnia among CF members in order to further suicide prevention efforts.

1179,A prospective cohort study of nonfatal accidental overdose among street youth: The link with suicidal ideation,"Introduction and Aims: Drug overdose and suicide are the two leading causes of death among street youth. The literature discusses the two faces of drug overdose: accidental act and suicide attempt. Some authors have stated that accidental overdoses may be a hidden expression of suicidal ideation. This study longitudinally examined the relationship between recent suicidal ideations and non-fatal accidental drug overdoses among street youth. Design and Methods: Between July 2001 and December 2005, 858 street youth (14-23 years old) were recruited for a prospective cohort study. Youth were eligible if, in the previous year, they had been without a place to sleep more than once or had used the services of street youth agencies on a regular basis (â‰¥3). Participants completed baseline questionnaires and follow-up interviews were carried out every 6 months. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were conducted. Apart from suicidal ideation and accidental drug overdose, variables considered in the model were age, sex, problematic alcohol use, homelessness, injection drug use and polydrug use (â‰¥3 drugs). Results: Accidental drug overdose was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio 1.88; 95% confidence interval 1.23-2.54). Homelessness, injection drug use and polydrug use were also significant in the final model. Discussion and Conclusions: Results show that, during follow up, suicidal ideation independently increased risks of accidental overdose. They also underscore the need for interventions beyond educational prevention. Primary care practitioners should investigate suicidal ideations and behaviours of street youth in treatment for accidental overdose. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1181,Clinical preference for factors in treatment of geriatric depression,"Little is known about symptom preferences of clinical psychiatrists in the treatment of geriatric depression and preferences for avoiding adverse drug effects. Participants (board-certified psychiatrists) were recruited prior to a lecture on geriatric depression during a continuing education program. An analytic hierarchy process was performed and participants were asked for pairwise comparison of criteria guiding them in appraising therapeutic efficacy, and in avoiding toxicity and adverse events. Of the 61 participants from the continuing education program, 42 (69%) returned their data sheet. Avoidance of cardiotoxicity was regarded as more important than avoidance of hepatotoxicity or hematotoxicity. Concerning adverse events, highest preference was given to avoidance of falls and drug interactions, followed by avoidance of sedation, weight change, and impairment of sexual function. The most important preferences for appraisal of therapeutic efficacy were suicidality over ability to concentrate and sleep. Clinical psychiatrists have a hierarchy of preferences for treatment goals and avoidance of adverse events and toxicity. This raises the question for future research whether these preferences cause differences in prescription patterns in clinical practice even though a multitude of antidepressants are similarly effective when judged with instruments used in clinical trials.

1182,Internet use and electronic gaming by children and adolescents with emotional and behavioural problems in Australia - results from the second Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing,"Background: Concerns have been raised of a potential connection between excessive online activity outside the academic realm and increased levels of psychological distress in young people. Young Minds Matter: the second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing provides estimates of the prevalence of online activity and allows an exploration of associations between this activity, a range of mental disorders, socio-demographic characteristics and risk taking behaviour.; Methods: Based on a randomized nationally representative sample, a household survey of mental health and wellbeing (Young Minds Matter) was conducted in 2013-14. Interviews were conducted with 6,310 parents and carers of 4-17 year-olds (55Â % response rate), together with self-report questionnaires completed by 2,967 11-17 year-olds in these households (89Â % response rate). The survey identified a range of mental disorders and emotional problems using a variety of diagnostic tools, with the self-report including questions about use of the Internet and electronic games. Five behaviours were measured related to this activity, with 'problem behaviour' being defined as exhibiting at least four out of five behaviours.; Results: Levels of Internet use (98.9Â %, CI 98.5-99.3Â %) and electronic gaming (85.3Â %, CI 83.9-86.6Â %) were high, and 3.9Â % (CI 3.2-4.6Â %) of young people reported problem behaviour. The proportion of girls with very high levels of psychological distress and problem behaviour (41.8Â %,CI 28.8-54.9Â %) was twice that for boys (19.4Â %, CI 7.7-31.1Â %). Those engaging with a range of risk factors reported higher prevalence of problem behaviour than others. Youth who suffered from emotional problems or high levels of psychological distress spent the most time online or playing games. Multivariate analysis showed associations with problem behaviour and having attempted suicide, experiencing high to very high levels of psychological distress, using alcohol, and living in a poorly functioning family. It was not possible to determine the direction of the associations.; Conclusion: There are links between problem behaviours associated with Internet use and electronic gaming, and mental disorders and risk-taking behaviour in young people.

Ss were aged 1-18 yrs. Similar symptoms were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of a matched unabused control group. Common somatic complaints in the SA patients included dysuria, vaginal discharge, and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral problems noted during the follow-up period among the SA patients included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts.

Facilitated group discussion reduces burnout among practicing clinicians. Objectiveâ€‚We hypothesized that this type of intervention would reduce incident burnout among first-year IM residents. Methodsâ€‚Between June 2013 and May 2014, participants from a convenience sample of 51 incoming IM residents were randomly assigned (in groups of 3) to the intervention or a control. Twice-monthly theme-based discussion sessions (18 total) led by expert facilitators were held for intervention groups. Surveys were administered at study onset and completion. Demographic and personal characteristics were collected. Burnout and burnout domains were the primary outcomes. Following convention, we defined burnout as a high emotional exhaustion or depersonalization score on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Resultsâ€‚All 51 eligible residents participated; 39 (76%) completed both surveys. Initial burnout prevalence (10 of 21 [48%] versus 7 of 17 [41%], P = .69), incidence of burnout at year end (9 of 11 [82%] versus 5 of 10 [50%], P = .18), and secondary outcomes were similar in intervention and control arms. More residents in the intervention group had high year-end depersonalization scores (18 of 21 [86%] versus 9 of 17 [53%], P = .04). Many intervention residents revealed that sessions did not truly free them from clinical or educational responsibilities. Conclusionsâ€‚A facilitated group discussion intervention did not decrease burnout in resident physicians.

1186,Are Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Implicated in Histaminergic Dysregulation in Bipolar Disorder?: AN HYPOTHESIS,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is an extremely disabling psychiatric disease, characterized by alternate states of mania (or hypomania) and depression with euthymic states in between. Currently, patients receive pharmacological treatment with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Unfortunately, not all patients respond well to this type of treatment. Bipolar patients are also more prone to heart and metabolic diseases as well as a higher risk of suicide compared to the healthy population. For a correct brain function is indispensable a right protein and lipids (e.g., fatty acids) balance. In particular, the amount of fatty acids in the brain corresponds to a 50-70% of the dry weight. It has been reported that in specific brain regions of BD patients there is a reduction in the content of unsaturated n-3 fatty acids. Accordingly, a diet rich in n-3 fatty acids has beneficial effects in BD patients, while their absence or high levels of saturated fatty acids in the diet are correlated to the risk of developing the disease. On the other hand, the histamine system is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric diseases such as BD. Histamine is a neuromodulator involved in arousal, motivation, and energy balance; drugs acting on the histamine receptor H3 have shown potential as antidepressants and antipsychotics. The histaminergic system as other neurotransmission systems can be altered by fatty acid membrane composition. The purpose of this review is to explore how polyunsaturated fatty acids content alterations are related to the histaminergic system modulation and their impact in BD pathophysiology.; BAS, PUFAs, bipolar disorder, fatty acids, histaminergic system, omega-3","Riveros, MarÃ­a E. & Retamal, Mauricio A.",0,1186
1187,Adolescent insomnia as a risk factor for early adult depression and substance abuse,"Study Objective: To evaluate the association between adolescent insomnia and mental health during adolescence and young adulthood. Design: Cross-sectional and prospective study. Settings: School and in home. Participants: Nationally based population sample of 4494 adolescents, 12 to 18 years old at baseline (mean = 15.83 years), with 3582 young adults, 18 to 25 years old (mean = 21.25 years) at 6- to 7-year follow-up. Measures: Self-report measures of mental health. Results: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 9.4% of the adolescents. Cross-sectionally, adolescent insomnia symptoms were associated with use of alcohol, cannabis, and drugs other than cannabis; depression; suicide ideation; and suicide attempts (all P values < 0.01) after controlling for sex. Prospectively, insomnia symptoms during adolescence were a significant risk factor for depression diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.3) in young adulthood after controlling for sex and baseline depression. Conclusion: This study is the first to longitudinally evaluate insomnia symptoms during adolescence as a risk factor for mental health problems in young adulthood. The findings indicate that insomnia is a prevalent problem for adolescents and argue for future treatment-outcome studies to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of various insomnia interventions in this age group.

1188,Depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior in adolescents,"Examined the associations between symptoms assessed in structured interviews that followed the format of the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and suicidal behavior in 64 13-18 yr old psychiatric inpatients. Of the Ss, 31 had made no suicide attempts, 15 had made 2 or more attempts, and 6 had made medically serious suicide attempts. The medical seriousness of suicidal behavior was associated with conscious intent to die and with the number of previous nonlethal suicide attempts. Suicidal behavior was associated with depressed mood, negative self-evaluation, anhedonia, insomnia, poor concentration, indecisiveness, lack of reactivity of mood, psychomotor disturbance, and alcohol and drug abuse. Results suggest that adolescents can be reliable reporters of their suicide potential and that clinicians need to be sensitive to symptoms of major depressive disorder in assessing potentially suicidal adolescents.

1189,Variables associated with reductions in insomnia severity among acutely suicidal patients receiving brief cognitive behavioral therapy for suicide prevention,"This study compared changes in sleep disturbance over time across brief cognitive behavioral therapy for suicide prevention and treatment as usual and examined the mechanisms that link sleep disturbance with several suicide risk factors.Method: Active duty U.S. Army soldiers (N = 152) completed a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of brief cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 76) or treatment as usual (n = 76). Six assessments of insomnia symptoms, hopelessness, coping, and suicide beliefs were tracked over 24 months.Results: Brief cognitive behavioral therapy patients reported a significant decrease in sleep disturbance symptoms over time while treatment as usual patients did not. These improvements were initially observed during treatment and carried over through 12-months. Changes in sleep disturbance predicted changes in suicide risk. Longitudinal growth modeling was used to assess potential mechanisms of this effect. Results suggested that changes in cognitive flexibility, as defined by measures of hopelessness and suicide beliefs, predicted change in sleep disturbance symptoms. These relationships did not differ across treatment groups.Limitations: The participants were active duty military personnel. Therefore, the results may not generalize to other patient populations. A greater number of assessment periods in closer proximity as well as additional measures of constructs of interest would have improved the internal validity of this study.Conclusions: Brief cognitive behavioral therapy significantly reduces sleep disturbance and suicide risk. Changes in cognitive flexibility, in part, explain change in sleep disturbance across both treatments",Roberge EM; Bryan CJ; Peterson A; Rudd MD,0,1189
1190,Stress and coping patterns among adolescent runaways,"Conducted in-depth interviews with 30 runaways under 18 yrs of age and 30 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-grade nonrunaways to explore the extent to which particular stressful events and inadequate coping skills precipitate runaway episodes. Findings show that certain types of stressful events (e.g., parent-youth conflict, physical abuse, and school problems), combined with inadequate coping patterns (drug use, leaving the house temporarily, crying, attempting suicide, going to sleep, and trying to forget) caused Ss to run away from home. 83% of runaways reported the use of maladaptive means for dealing with stress, whereas 80% of nonrunaways reported coping with stress by means of problem-solving processes. In 5 areas of daily life, nonrunaways exhibited patterns of competence: (1) positive attitudes toward school and a scarcity of serious school problems; (2) participation in specific constructive, individualized, and group leisure-time activities; (3) ability to articulate a meaningful future career goal; (4) ability to anticipate the negative consequences of running away; and (5) nonreliance on drugs stronger than marihuana. In addition, more nonrunaways were living in less conflict-ridden homes than were runaways.

1191,"Personality, psychopathology and nightmares in young people","The current study investigated the relationship between nightmare experience, psychopathology and personality in a sample of 148 Australian school students aged between 12 and 18 years. In this sample, adolescents who experienced high levels of nightmare sleeping distress also tended to experience high levels of nightmare waking distress. Adolescents who experienced higher frequency of nightmares also tended to experience higher levels of nightmare waking distress. Frequency of nightmares was not associated with nightmare sleeping distress. No significant difference for gender was found on any of the nightmare measures. All psychopathology scores intercorrelated strongly and psychopathology was associated with all three nightmare measures. Anxiety was the most commonly reported correlate of all three nightmare measures. The hypothesis that nightmare sleeping distress was predicted by personality and psychopathology was partially supported. Nightmare sleeping distress was more likely to be associated with high levels of neuroticism and with lower levels of psychoticism, but not with extraversion. However, other hypotheses predicting a mediational model for personality and psychopathology with nightmare frequency and nightmare waking distress were not supported.

1192,Strengthening psychiatry's numbers,"This editorial discusses strengthening psychiatry's numbers. Systemic issues are also important to the recruitment difficulties we face in psychiatry. Relatively few graduate medical education positions are allocated to psychiatry. In order to increase our workforce in the future, more residency positions in psychiatry will be needed, and their funding made more secure. The current national focus on the link between mental health, aggression, and suicide will surely enhance the profession's position in advocating for increased funding for residency positions. This national focus on mental health should also enhance our advocacy for longer clerkships and for revisiting our methods of selecting medical students. As we have argued, we should work on several other fronts, too, by providing an effort to improve the quality of medical students' experiences related to psychiatry and by countering stigmatizing attitudes to patients and to the profession. Attention by academic psychiatrists to the grave workforce shortage in our field is essential if we are to strengthen our numbers in the years to come. At stake are the health of the public and the vitality of the specialty and subspecialties of psychiatry, and the future of academic psychiatry.

1193,Depression and insomnia among adolescents: a prospective perspective,"Background: No studies of adolescents have examined the prospective, reciprocal association between insomnia and major depression.; Methods: A two-wave, community-based cohort of 3134 youths aged 11-17 at baseline. Major depression was assessed using DSM-IV criteria. Three measures of insomnia were used also following DSM-IV: P1, any symptom of insomnia; P2, any symptom plus impairment; P3, P2 with no comorbid mood, anxiety or substance use disorders.; Results: In general, the association between insomnia and depression was stronger and more consistent for major depression than for symptoms of depression. Baseline insomnia (P1 and P2) increased subsequent risk of major depression 2-3-fold and P1 2-fold in multivariate analyses. Major depression increased risk for subsequent insomnia 2-3-fold for P1 and P2 2-fold for P2 in multivariate analyses. Results varied by measure of insomnia used.; Limitations: Only symptoms of insomnia were assessed, so we could not examine the effects of comorbid sleep disorders nor did we have objective or biological measures of disturbed sleep. We also did not collect data on parental reports of youth depression nor insomnia or sleep problems.; Conclusion: Our results provide the first prospective data on insomnia and major depression among adolescents indicating the two are reciprocally related. More studies are needed examining trajectories of insomnia and major depression in childhood and adolescence.; Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

1194,Obesity has few effects on future psychosocial functioning of adolescents,"We reexamine the effects of obesity on a wide range (n=17) of indicators of functioning drawn from five broad domains: interpersonal problems, psychological problems, suicidal behaviors, academic performance, and psychiatric disorders. Evidence on this question is mixed. Data are analyzed from a large community sample of adolescents 11-17 at baseline (n=4175) who were followed up a year later (n=3134). Using measured height and weight, overweight was defined as 95th>BMIâ‰¤85th percentile and obese as BMI >95th percentile. At baseline, obesity was associated with increased odds only for any mood disorder and poor perceived mental health. For boys, there were no significant associations, but girls had higher odds of problems at school, poor perceived mental health, and mood disorders. Results from the two-wave cohort reveal obesity increased future risk only for poor perceived mental health. For boys, the same pattern was observed, but for girls there were no significant associations. Overall, we found that weight status had few deleterious effects on adolescent social functioning, in multivariate, prospective analyses. If there is an effect of obesity on functioning, it may operate through mediators such as body image.; Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1195,"Mood disorders and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome: an update on prevalence, etiology, comorbidity, clinical associations, and implications","Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) consists of multiple motor tics and one or more phonic tics. Psychopathology occurs in approximately 90% of GTS patients, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) being common. Depression is common, with a lifetime risk of 10% and a prevalence of between 1.8% and 8.9%. Depression and depressive symptoms are found to occur in 13% and 76% of GTS patients attending specialist clinics, respectively. In controlled studies embracing over 700 GTS patients, the patients were significantly more depressed than controls in all but one instance. In community and epidemiological studies, depression in GTS individuals was evident in two of five investigations. Clinical correlates of depression in people with GTS appear to be: tic severity and duration, the presence of echophenomena and coprophenomena, premonitory sensations, sleep disturbances, obsessive-compulsive behaviors/OCD, self-injurious behaviors, aggression, conduct disorder (CD) in childhood, and, possibly, ADHD. Depression in people with GTS has been shown to result in a lower quality of life, potentially leading to hospitalization and suicide. The etiology of depression appears to be multifactorial. Bipolar affective disorder (BAD) and GTS may be related in some individuals. However, it is noted that sample sizes in most of these studies were small, and it is unclear at the present time as to why BAD may be overrepresented among GTS patients.

1196,Recent advances in sleep-wake cycle and biological rhythms in bipolar disorder,"The cyclical nature of periodic switches in energy, motor activation and sleep-wake cycles in bipolar disorder suggests a strong underlying relationship with disturbances in chronobiology. Current research is refining our understanding of the various patterns of sleep-wake and biological rhythms alterations at early and later stages of this illness, as well as across its depressive/fatigue, manic/hypomanic and euthymic phases. This research focuses on early detection and subsequent monitoring to predict and better manage recurrent episodes. Sleep-wake cycle and biological rhythms disturbances are also well known to affect other key aspects of physical health (notably metabolic functions), cognitive performance and elevated risks for suicide. Increasing evidence now supports the integration of behavioural or pharmacological therapeutic strategies that target the sleep-wake and circadian systems in the ongoing treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder.;Bipolar Disorder/*physiopathology, Circadian Rhythm/*physiology, Sleep/*physiology, Humans, Psychomotor Performance/physiology, Seasons, Sleep-Wake Transition Disorders/physiopathology","Robillard, RÃ©becca; Naismith, Sharon L & Hickie, Ian B",0,1196

For Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) psychiatric diagnosis, the Portuguese version of the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used.; Results: Out of the 200 patients interviewed, 56.5% complained of insomnia, and 50.0% suffered from at least one psychiatric disorder. Major depressive episode (MDE) (P<0.001), generalized anxiety disorder (P=0.025) and suicide risk (P=0.034) were associated with insomnia (univariate analysis).

1198,Sleep quality and suicidal behavior in euthymic bipolar patients,"Presents the study which discuses about the sleep quality and suicidal behavior in euthymic bipolar patients. Sleep disturbances in general â€“ most notably insomnia â€“ are associated with suicidal ideation as well as suicide attempt in both clinical and non-clinical samples. The aim was to investigate the relationship between sleep disruption and suicidal behavior in a sample of euthymic BD patients. Patients presented scores lower than 7 â€“ euthymia â€“ for both Hamilton and Young mood rating scales in the previous 4 weeks. It would be interesting to prospectively assess the same BD sample across the different phases of the disorder since euthymia could unquestionably have influenced the absence of association between poor sleep quality and current suicidal behavior in the present study. Several studies have reported the association of some sleep disturbances with increased suicide risk in different clinical samples, which could not be replicated in our study. Although the small sample size and the cross-sectional observation could be limitations to the present study, it may shed preliminary light on the scarcity of data relating to sleep disturbances and suicidal behavior in euthymic BD samples. Further studies with larger samples will be required to better address this important question.

1199,"Sleep Apnea, Disability Pensions, and Cause-Specific Mortality: A Swedish Nationwide Register Linkage Study","Sleep apnea is a common problem affecting daily functioning and health. We evaluated associations between sleep apnea and receipt of a disability pension and mortality in a prospective study of 74,543 cases of sleep apnea (60,125 outpatient, 14,418 inpatient) from the Swedish Patient Register (2000-2009 inclusive). Cases were matched to 5 noncases (n = 371,592) and followed from diagnosis/inclusion to December 31, 2010, via nationwide registers. During a mean follow-up period of 5.1 (standard deviation, 2.7) years, 13% of men and 21% of women with inpatient sleep apnea received a disability pension. Inpatient sleep apnea was associated with higher total mortality (for men, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59, 1.84; for women, HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 2.04, 2.67), with associations being strongest for deaths due to ischemic heart disease (for men, HR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.94, 2.65; for women, HR = 5.27, 95% CI: 3.78, 7.34), respiratory disorders (for men, HR = 3.29, 95% CI: 2.45, 4.42; for women, HR= 5.24, 95% CI: 3.52, 7.81), and suicide (for men, HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.60; for women, HR = 4.33, 95% CI: 1.96, 9.56). There were no associations of inpatient sleep apnea with cancer mortality. Outpatient sleep apnea was associated with a higher risk of receiving a disability pension but not higher total mortality.

1200,Sleep disturbances and cause-specific mortality: Results from the GAZEL cohort study,"Poor sleep is an increasing problem in modern society, but most previous studies on the association between sleep and mortality rates have addressed only duration, not quality, of sleep. The authors prospectively examined the effects of sleep disturbances on mortality rates and on important risk factors for mortality, such as body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes. A total of 16,989 participants in the GAZEL cohort study were asked validated questions on sleep disturbances in 1990 and were followed up until 2009, with <1% loss to follow-up. Body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes were measured annually through self-reporting. During follow-up, a total of 1,045 men and women died. Sleep disturbances were associated with a higher overall mortality risk in men (P = 0.005) but not in women (P = 0.33). This effect was most pronounced for men <45 years of age (â‰¥3 symptoms vs. none: hazard ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 3.33). There were no clear associations between sleep disturbances and cardiovascular mortality rates, although men and women with sleep disturbances were more likely to develop hypertension and diabetes (P < 0.001). Compared with people with no sleep disturbances, men who reported â‰¥3 types of sleep disturbance had an almost 5 times' higher risk of committing suicide (hazard ratio = 4.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.59, 15.7).

1201,Which healthy lifestyle factors are associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation among adolescents faced with cyberbullying?,"Cyberbullying is associated with negative mental health outcomes including adolescent suicidal ideation. This requires effective and accessible preventive efforts. Healthy lifestyles are factors adolescents themselves can modify that may lower their risk of suicidal ideation. The aim of this study was to examine associations between physical activity, (outdoor) sport participation, a healthy diet, higher sleep duration and low levels of smoking and alcohol use, and suicidal ideation when faced with cyberbullying. A cross-sectional survey was administered in 2014â€“2015 to 1037 adolescents (12â€“18 years, M age = 15; 50% girls) in Flanders, Belgium. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess direct effects of cyberbullying involvement (victim, perpetrator, bystander) on suicidal ideation, and interaction effects between cyberbullying involvement, healthy lifestyles and suicidal ideation. Results showed that cyberbullying victimization, perpetration and bystanding were associated with higher suicidal ideation, but that the association with cyberbullying perpetration disappeared when corrected for other cyberbullying involvement forms. More physical activity, sleeping longer, more often taking a healthy diet and lower levels of smoking were associated with lower suicidal ideation. Some associations of healthy lifestyles with suicidal ideation disappeared at higher levels of cyberbullying involvement. Low alcohol consumption and (outdoor) sport participation were not associated with suicidal ideation, and sport participation was even associated with higher suicidal ideation at low levels of cyberbullying involvement. These findings suggest a novel approach to suicide prevention may be warranted, by strengthening healthy lifestyles as factors that adolescents themselves can modify to increase their resilience and reduce suicidal ideation.

1202,Differentiating acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD) from anxiety and depression Symptoms: A network analysis,"A growing body of literature supports the potential existence of a new clinical entity, Acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD), which is characterized by rapid-onset, acute suicidality. This study aimed to evaluate whether current ASAD symptoms (i.e., suicidal intent, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, disgust with others and oneself, agitation, irritability, insomnia, and nightmares) comprise a psychopathological network distinct from anxiety and depression symptoms.Methods: A sample of 167 psychiatric inpatients completed self-report measures of current ASAD, anxiety, and depression symptoms.Results: Network analyses revealed three distinct clusters of symptoms corresponding to ASAD, anxiety, and depression symptom self-report measure items. Namely, ASAD symptoms not only demonstrated strong associations with each other, but they also exhibited weak associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression.Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and distinct self-report measures to assess all constructs, which may have led to methodological confounds that influenced the observed network structure.Conclusions: Overall, our findings provide further evidence for ASAD as a syndrome with strongly interrelated symptoms. Furthermore, results indicate that ASAD may represent a construct distinct from anxiety and depression, underscoring its potential diagnostic value.

1203,Suicide-Specific Rumination Relates to lifetime suicide attempts above and beyond a variety of other suicide risk factors,"Suicide-specific rumination, defined as a mental fixation on one's suicidal thoughts, intentions, and plans, may be an important predictor of suicidal behavior. To date, suicide-specific rumination has demonstrated convergence with, yet distinction from, a variety of suicide risk factors, and differentiated suicide attempters from ideators. However, no research has examined whether suicide-specific rumination is associated with lifetime suicide attempts above and beyond the presence of a host of other relevant suicide risk factors. The present study tested this hypothesis in samples of students (N = 300) and community members recruited via Amazon's MTurk (N = 209) who reported a lifetime history of suicidal ideation. Results indicated that suicide-specific rumination was associated with the presence of a lifetime suicide attempt, above and beyond a variety of other commonly-cited risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in both samples, including suicidal ideation, general rumination, interpersonal theory variables, emotion-relevant factors (dysregulation, experiential avoidance, distress tolerance, negative affect), symptoms of depression and anxiety, and overarousal. Overall, though limited by the use of non-clinical samples and a cross-sectional study design, that suicide-specific rumination outperformed all other suicide risk factors in predicting the presence of a lifetime suicide attempt suggests the potential potency of this relatively understudied risk factor in understanding transitions to suicidal behavior.

1204,Severity of suicidal ideation matters: Reexamining correlates of suicidal ideation using quantile regression,"Objective: Numerous risk factors have been identified for suicidal ideation, including perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, agitation, insomnia, nightmares, cognitive anxiety sensitivity, and rumination. However, the complexity of these associations has not been well studied; the magnitude of these effects may vary at differing levels of suicidal ideation. The present study reexamined established risk factors for suicidal ideation using quantile regression, a statistical technique that calculates the effect at numerous quantiles of suicidal ideation, as opposed to the average effect across all quantiles. Method: A sample of 354 psychiatric outpatients (61.3% female, meanage = 27.01 years, standard deviation = 10.40) completed selfâ€report measures of their suicidal ideation and related risk factors prior to their initial intake appointments. Results: The relationship between each suicide risk factor and suicidal ideation was strongest at higher (.9 quantile), as opposed to nonexistent (.5 quantile) and lowâ€moderate (.7 quantile), levels of suicidal ideation. The interaction proposed by the interpersonal theory of suicide was significant at nonexistent and lowâ€moderate, but not high, levels of suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that predictors of suicidal ideation differed in magnitude at varying levels of suicidal ideation.

1205,Examination of MMPI“2“RF substantive scales as indicators of acute suicidal affective disturbance components,"A new suicide-specific diagnostic entity, acute suicidal affective disturbance (ASAD), was recently proposed to fill a void in the nomenclature. Although several studies have examined the reliability, validity, and potential clinical utility of ASAD, no studies have examined personality indicators of ASAD. This study sought to examine the association between personality and psychopathology factors, as assessed by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventoryâ€“2â€“Revised Form (MMPIâ€“2â€“RF), and constructs that comprise ASAD in a sample of 554 psychiatric outpatients who completed all measures prior to their intake appointments. A smaller subset of patients (N = 58) also completed a measure designed to assess lifetime ASAD symptoms. Results indicated that ASAD symptoms were associated with traits characterized by emotional turmoil and atypical cognitive processes. Further, suicide-related criteria that comprise ASAD were related to low positive emotionality and hopelessness, whereas the overarousal criteria were associated with somatic symptoms and an inability to tolerate frustration and stress. These findings expand on previous research that examines the convergent and discriminant validity of ASAD and could inform clinical treatment by providing insight into personality traits that might be associated with acute suicide risk.

1206,Acute suicidal affective disturbance: Factorial structure and initial validation across psychiatric outpatient and inpatient samples,"Background: A new clinical entity, Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD), was recently proposed to characterize rapid-onset, acute suicidality including the cardinal symptom of behavioral intent. This study examines the proposed ASAD criteria factor-analytically and in relation to correlates of suicidal behavior and existing psychiatric disorders in samples of psychiatric outpatients and inpatients. Methods: Two samples of psychiatric outpatients (N = 343, aged 18â€“71 years, 60.6% female, 74.9% White) and inpatients (N = 7,698, aged 15â€“99 years, 57.2% female, 87.8% White) completed measures of their ASAD symptoms and psychological functioning. Results: Across both samples, results of a confirmatory factor analysis supported the unidimensional nature of the ASAD construct. Additionally, results provided evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of ASAD, demonstrating its relation to, yet distinction from, other psychiatric disorders and correlates of suicide in expected ways. Importantly, ASAD symptoms differentiated multiple attempters, single attempters, and non-attempters, as well as attempters, ideators, and non-suicidal patients, and was an indicator of past suicide attempts above and beyond symptoms of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Limitations: This study utilized cross-sectional data and did not use a standardized measure of ASAD. Conclusions: ASAD criteria formed a unidimensional construct that was associated with suicide-related variables and other psychiatric disorders in expected ways. If supported by future research, ASAD may fill a gap in the current diagnostic classification system (DSM-5) by characterizing and predicting acute suicide risk.

1208,Overarousal as a mechanism of the relation between rumination and suicidality,"Rumination, particularly brooding, is associated with suicidal ideation and attempts; however, mechanisms of these associations have not been identified. The present study examined manifestations of overarousalâ€”agitation, insomnia, and nightmaresâ€”that have been linked to both rumination and suicide as indirect indicators of the link between brooding and suicidal ideation/attempts. A sample of 492 psychiatric outpatients (64.2% female), aged 17â€”65 years (M = 26.75, SD = 10.32), completed self-report measures before their intake appointments with a therapist. Results indicated that agitation and nightmares, but not insomnia, each significantly explained the association between brooding and suicidal ideation and between brooding and the presence of a past suicide attempt.

1209,Conceptual and empirical scrutiny of covarying depression out of suicidal ideation,"Depression and suicidal ideation are highly intertwined constructs. A common practice in suicide research is to control for depression when predicting suicidal ideation, yet implications of this practice have not been subjected to sufficient empirical scrutiny. We explore what, precisely, is represented in a suicidal ideation variable with depression covaried out. In an adult psychiatric outpatient sample (N = 354), we computed two variablesâ€”depression with suicidal ideation covaried out, and suicidal ideation with depression covaried outâ€”and examined correlations between these residuals, three factors comprising a variegated collection of psychological correlates of suicidal ideation, psychiatric diagnoses, and past suicidal behavior. Findings indicated that suicidal ideation with depression covaried out appears to be characterized by fearlessness about death, self-sacrifice, and externalizing pathology. We propose that suicidal ideation may comprise two distinct components: desire for death (passive ideation and depressive cognitions) and will (self-sacrifice, fearlessness, externalizing behavior). Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

1210,Manifestations of overarousal account for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation,"Background: Recent evidence suggests an association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Cognitive anxiety sensitivity has also been implicated as a precursor to various forms of overarousal. These manifestations of overarousal (i.e., agitation, insomnia, nightmares, and anger) may account for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Methods: In Study 1, undergraduate students selectively sampled for recent suicidal ideation completed all measures online. In Study 2, clinical outpatients completed all measures prior to their initial intake appointments at a psychology clinic. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that agitation and insomnia individually and jointly accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, controlling for general anxiety and demographic variables. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings, such that, controlling for demographics, general anxiety, and physical and social anxiety sensitivity, agitation and anger each independently and together accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, whereas insomnia and nightmares did not. Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and self-report measures in both samples as well as a sample of undergraduate students in Study 1. Conclusions: Together, these findings suggest that agitation and anger may explain the previously established relationship between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Targeting cognitive anxiety sensitivity in treatment may in turn reduce these forms of overarousal and thereby suicide risk.

1211,An exploratory study of cannabis withdrawal among Indigenous Australian prison inmates: study protocol,"Introduction: Cannabis use and dependence is a serious health and criminal justice issue among incarcerated populations internationally. Upon abrupt, enforced cessation of cannabis, prisoners may suffer irritability and anger that can lead to threatening behaviour, intimidation, violence, sleep disturbances and self-harm. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome, proposed for inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013, has not been examined in Indigenous populations. Owing to the exceptionally high rates of cannabis use in the community, high proportions of Australian Indigenous prisoners may suffer from withdrawal upon entry to custody.; Methods and Analysis: 60 male and 60 female Indigenous prisoners (18-40 years) at a high risk of cannabis dependence will be recruited upon entry to custody. A pictorial representation of the standard Cannabis Withdrawal Scale will be tested for reliability and validity. Cortisol markers will be measured in saliva, as the indicators of onset and severity of cannabis withdrawal and psychological distress. The characteristics will be described as percentages and mean or median values with 95% CI. Receiver operator curve analysis will determine an ideal cut-off of the Cannabis Withdrawal Scale and generalised estimating equations modelling will test changes over time. The acceptability and efficacy of proposed resources will be assessed qualitatively using thematic analysis.; Outcomes: A valid and reliable measure of cannabis withdrawal for use with Indigenous populations, the onset and time course of withdrawal symptoms in this population and the development of culturally acceptable resources and interventions to identify and manage cannabis withdrawal.; Ethics and Dissemination: The project has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H4651).The results will be reported via peer reviewed publications, conference, seminar presentations and on-line media for national and international dissemination.; Australia, Cannabis, Indigenous, Prisoners, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome","Rogerson, Bernadette; Copeland, Jan; Buttner, Petra; Bohanna, India; Cadet-James, Yvonne; Sarnyai, Zoltan & Clough, Alan R.",0,1211
1212,A preliminary study of the effect of a diagnosis of concussion on PTSD symptoms and other psychiatric variables at the time of treatment seeking among veterans,"The aim of this study was to assess whether a diagnosis of concussion given at a Veterans Healthcare Administration secondary traumatic brain injury assessment impacted either posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology or other variables at the time veterans sought treatment for PTSD. This retrospective study compared 61 male veterans with a history of military-related concussion and military-related PTSD to 83 male veterans with military-related PTSD but without a diagnosis of military-related concussion. There were no significant between-group differences in PTSD symptomatology. However, the cohort with a history of military concussion endorsed decreased ability to cope with PTSD symptoms, increased problems with physical health, and more pain complaints. If replicated, these results may guide the design of more effective interventions for veterans who receive diagnoses of PTSD and concussion.

1213,Predictors of Response to Ketamine in Treatment Resistant Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder,"Objectives: Extant evidence indicates that ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressive (TRD) symptoms as a part of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The identification of depressed sub-populations that are more likely to benefit from ketamine treatment remains a priority. In keeping with this view, the present narrative review aims to identify the pretreatment predictors of response to ketamine in TRD as part of MDD and BD.; Method: Electronic search engines PubMed/MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus were searched for relevant articles from inception to January 2018. The search term ketamine was cross-referenced with the terms depression, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, predictors, and response and/or remission.; Results: Multiple baseline pretreatment predictors of response were identified, including clinical (i.e., Body Mass Index (BMI), history of suicide, family history of alcohol use disorder), peripheral biochemistry (i.e., adiponectin levels, vitamin B12 levels), polysomnography (abnormalities in delta sleep ratio), neurochemistry (i.e., glutamine/glutamate ratio), neuroimaging (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex activity), genetic variation (i.e., Val66Met BDNF allele), and cognitive functioning (i.e., processing speed). High BMI and a positive family history of alcohol use disorder were the most replicated predictors.; Conclusions: A pheno-biotype of depression more, or less likely, to benefit with ketamine treatment is far from complete. Notwithstanding, metabolic-inflammatory alterations are emerging as possible pretreatment response predictors of depressive symptom improvement, most notably being cognitive impairment. Sophisticated data-driven computational methods that are iterative and agnostic are more likely to provide actionable baseline pretreatment predictive information.; Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Ketamine/*therapeutic use, Humans, Treatment Outcome, MDD*, depression*, ketamine*, predictors*, remission*, response*","Rong, Carola; Park, Caroline; Rosenblat, Joshua D.; Subramaniapillai, Mehala; Zuckerman, Hannah; Fus, Dominika; Lee, Yena L.; Pan, Zihang; Brietzke, Elisa; Mansur, Rodrigo B.; Cha, Danielle S.; Lui, Leanna M.

1215,"Media and technology use predicts ill-being among children, preteens and teenagers independent of the negative health impacts of exercise and eating habits","The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no screen time for children under the age of 2 and limited screen time for all children. However, no such guidelines have been proposed for preteens and teenagers. Further, research shows that children, preteens, and teenagers are using massive amounts of media and those with more screen time have been shown to have increased obesity, reduced physical activity, and decreased health. This study examined the impact of technology on four areas of ill-being-psychological issues, behavior problems, attention problems and physical health-among children (aged 4-8), preteens (9-12), and teenagers (13-18) by having 1030 parents complete an online, anonymous survey about their own and their child's behaviors. Measures included daily technology use, daily food consumption, daily exercise, and health. Hypothesis 1, which posited that unhealthy eating would predict impaired ill-being, was partially supported, particularly for children and preteens. Hypothesis 2, which posited that reduced physical activity would predict diminished health levels, was partially supported for preteens and supported for teenagers. Hypothesis 3, that increased daily technology use would predict ill-being after factoring out eating habits and physical activity, was supported. For children and preteens, total media consumption predicted illbeing while for preteens specific technology uses, including video gaming and electronic communication, predicted ill-being. For teenagers, nearly every type of technological activity predicted poor health. Practical implications were discussed in terms of setting limits and boundaries on technology use and encouraging healthy eating and physical activity at home and at school.; Attention, Children, Electronic communication, Exercise, Food consumption, Health, Ill-being, Media, Obesity, Physical activity, Preteens, Screen time, Technology, Teenagers, Television, Video gaming","Rosen, L.

1216,Reconsidering the definition of Major Depression based on Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys,"Background: Diagnostic definitions for depressive disorders remain a debated topic, despite their central role in clinical practice and research. We use both recent evidence and nationally representative data to derive an empirically-based modification of DSM-IV/-5 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Method: A modified MDD diagnosis was derived by analyzing data from Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, a multistage probability sample of adults (n = 20 013; age â‰¥ 18 years) in coterminous USA, Alaska and Hawaii. The old and the newly suggested MDD definitions were compared for their associated disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule and number of disability days in past month), suicide attempt, and other covariates. Results: Our data-driven definition for major depression was 'lack of interest to all or most things' plus four other symptoms from the set {weight gain, weight loss, insomnia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, diminished ability to think/concentrate, suicidal ideation/attempt}. The new definition captured all the disability implied by MDD and excluded cases that showed no greater disability than the general population nor increased risk of suicide attempts. The lifetime prevalence of the new diagnosis was 14.7% (95% CI = 14â€“15.4%) of the population, slightly less than for the old definition (16.4%; CI = 15.4â€“17.3%). Limitations: Only conservative modifications of MDD could be studied, because of restrictions in the symptom data. Conclusions: With only small adjusting, the new definition for major depression may be more clinically relevant than the old one, and could serve as a conservative replacement for the old definition.

1217,A prospective study of risk factors for traumatic deaths in a retirement community,"We examined possible predictors of traumatic deaths by means of a case-control study nested within a large ongoing cohort study of residents of a Southern California retirement community. Baseline information was collected by means of a detailed mailed health survey completed by 11,888 residents in 1981-1982. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, being widowed or divorced (RR = 6.4, P = 0.009), sleeping 9 or more hours per night (RR = 4.6, P = 0.02), and drinking more than three alcoholic beverages a day (RR = 3.5, P = 0.04) were significant predictors of suicide risk. However, the strongest predictor of suicide was a mental outlook assessment summary score calculated from responses to seven questions derived from the Zung self-rating depression scale. Individuals in the poorest summary score category were 23 times more likely to commit suicide than individuals in the best summary score category (P = 0.004). Women who regularly practiced breast self-examination were also at very low risk for suicide (RR = 0.1, P = 0.0005). The mental outlook assessment summary score was also a predictor of accidental deaths, although the relative risk estimates were lower than those for suicide and the individual questions best predicting risk were different. A history of a serious chronic disease (RR = 2.6, P = 0.01) and moderate alcohol intake of less than two drinks per day (RR = 0.3, P = 0.01) were also predictors of accidental deaths.

1218,Does the death of a child influence parental use of psychotropic medication? A follow-up register study from Finland,"Background: Several studies have found that the loss of a child is associated with psychiatric health problems, yet few studies examined whether child loss influences psychotropic medication use. This study examined short- and long-term use of psychotropic medication, both before and after the death of a child, and its potential effect modifiers.; Methodology/principal Findings: A random sample of 205,456 parents, including 902 bereaved parents, were selected from a Finnish total population registry. The analyses were based on linear regressions using generalised estimation equations (GEE) and adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Annual psychotropic use was defined as having purchased prescribed psychotropic medication between 1996 and2012. Bereaved parents were followed for four years prior to and up to four years after the death of their child. An increase in the use of antidepressants and anxiolytics was found in parents following their loss. The highest percentage of use was found around one year after bereavement, followed by a steady decrease although this remained higher than the level of use among non-bereaved four years after the death. Between 20-25% of bereaved mothers and 10-15% of bereaved fathers used antidepressants or anxiolytics one year after bereavement while the corresponding number in non-bereaved was 5-10%. An increase in psychotropic medication was also found several years before the disease-related loss of a child.; Conclusions/significance: The use of psychotropic medication is markedly higher among parents after losing a child. Patterns of use leading up to and following the death of a child should be further examined in relation to clinical risk factors so as to identify at risk populations.; Medical Subject Headings: Bereavement, child death, psychotropic medication, death, child, register, Finland.; Bereavement*, Death*, Registries*, Parents/*psychology, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Finland, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male","Rostila, Mikael; MÃ¤ki, Netta & Martikainen, Pekka",1,1218
1219,Not everything that shakes is epilepsy' The differential diagnosis of paroxysmal nonepileptiform disorders,"Many infants, children, and adolescents exhibit unusual mannerisms, behaviors, and spells. These events cause concern to parents and are frequently brought to the attention of physicians. If the spells are infrequent and do not interfere with function, no intervention may be necessary. If they are severe and recurrent, however, diagnostic evaluation is necessary. This article has reviewed the most common spells that can be misdiagnosed as epilepsy by pediatricians. Other spells such as head banging, head rolling, body rocking, enuresis, nightmares, bruxism, obsessions, compulsions, self-injurious behavior, self-stimulating behavior, and stereotypies are reviewed elsewhere. Emphasis is placed on the importance of a thorough history, a complete general physical and neurologic examination, and the judicious use of laboratory testing. The diagnostic methodologies currently available, including cardiac evaluation, video-EEG monitoring, and polysomnography, will frequently result in a specific diagnosis, and allow appropriate treatment. In many cases, however, even after the above diagnostic tests have been utilized, no diagnosis is forthcoming, but reassurance and follow-up can be of help to the young patient and the family.;Epilepsy/*diagnosis, Seizures/*diagnosis, Cerebrovascular Disorders/diagnosis, Child, Diagnosis, Differential, Gastrointestinal Diseases/diagnosis, Humans, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Migraine Disorders/diagnosis, Movement Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis","Rothner, A D",0,1219

We characterized sleep quality in adolescents experiencing mania within the last 6-12 months. We examined the association between mood and sleep in 27 adolescents with BD and 24 matched healthy controls (HC). Subjects were assessed by parent and teen report of sleep, a semi-structured clinical interview, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Childhood Depression Rating Scale (CDRS-R). Average BD youth YMRS (mean 20.3 Â± 7.3) and CDRS-R (mean 42.4 Â± 14.1) scores indicated they were still ill at time of assessment. Compared to HCs, adolescents with BD have distinct patterns of prolonged sleep onset latency, frequent nighttime awakenings, and increased total time awake. Mood symptoms, specifically excessive guilt, self-injurious behavior, and worsening evening mood, interfered with sleep. Further studies are needed to determine whether early regulation of sleep would improve long-term outcome in BD youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1222,Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children growing up homeless in Paris Results of the ENFAMS survey,"Purpose: Children growing up in homeless families are disproportionately more likely to experience health and psychological problems. Our objective was to describe social, environmental, individual and family characteristics associated with emotional and behavioral difficulties among homeless children living in the Paris region. Methods: Face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of homeless families were conducted by bilingual psychologists and interviewers between January and May 2013 (n = 343 children ages 4-13 years). Mothers reported children's emotional and behavioral difficulties (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]), family socio-demographic characteristics, residential mobility, and parentsâ€™ and children's physical and mental health. Children were interviewed regarding their perception of their living arrangements, friendships and school experiences. We studied children's SDQ total score in a linear regression framework. Results: Homeless children had higher SDQ total scores than children in the general population of France, (mean total score = 11.3 vs 8.9, P < 0,001). In multivariate analyses, children's difficulties were associated with parentsâ€™ region of birth (beta = 1.74 for Sub-Saharan Africa, beta = 0.60 for Eastern Europe, beta = 3.22 for other countries, P = 0.020), residential mobility (beta = 0.22, P = 0.012), children's health (beta = 3.49, P < 0.001) and overweight (beta = 2.14, P = 0.007), the child's sleeping habits (beta = 2.82, P = 0.002), the mother's suicide risk (beta = 4.13, P < 0.001), the child's dislike of the family's accommodation (beta = 3.59, P < 0.001) and the child's experience of bullying (beta = 3.21, P = 0.002). Conclusions: Children growing up homeless experience high levels of psychological difficulties which can put them at risk for poor mental health and educational outcomes long-term. Access to appropriate screening and medical care for this vulnerable yet underserved group are greatly needed.

1225,Significant shared heritability underlies suicide attempt and clinically predicted probability of attempting suicide,"Suicide accounts for nearly 800,000 deaths per year worldwide with rates of both deaths and attempts rising. Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype asked as part of an online mental health survey taken by a subset of participants (nâ€‰=â€‰157,366) in the UK Biobank. After quality control, we leveraged a genotyped set of unrelated, white British ancestry participants including 2433 cases and 334,766 controls that included those that did not participate in the survey or were not explicitly asked about attempting suicide. The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h2SNPâ€‰=â€‰0.035, pâ€‰=â€‰7.12â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4) and the clinically predicted phenotype from VUMC (h2SNPâ€‰=â€‰0.046, pâ€‰=â€‰1.51â€‰Ã—â€‰10-2). A significant genetic overlap was demonstrated between the two measures of suicide attempt in these independent samples through polygenic risk score analysis (tâ€‰=â€‰4.02, pâ€‰=â€‰5.75â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5) and genetic correlation (rgâ€‰=â€‰1.073, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.36, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). Finally, we show significant but incomplete genetic correlation of suicide attempt with insomnia (rgâ€‰=â€‰0.34-0.81) as well as several psychiatric disorders (rgâ€‰=â€‰0.26-0.79). This work demonstrates the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. It points to a genetic underpinning to clinically predicted risk of attempting suicide that is similar to the genetic profile from a patient reported outcome. Lastly, it presents an approach for using EHR data and clinical prediction to generate quantitative measures from binary phenotypes that can improve power for genetic studies.; ","Ruderfer, Douglas M.; Walsh, Colin G.; Aguirre, Matthew W.; Tanigawa, Yosuke; Ribeiro, Jessica D.; Franklin, Joseph C. & Rivas, Manuel A.",1,1225
1226,Phallicide: A case of auto penile amputation as a mode of suicide,"Genital self-mutilation (GSM) has been frequently reported in association with psychiatric disorders. However, GSM in the form of auto penile amputation has been infrequently described and the few reports are of patients who had psychotic symptoms. This article presents a case report of a 33 year old single male from Southern India presented with low mood, decreased self-esteem, easy fatigability and disturbed sleep persisting for four years with intervening periods of partial remission. Detailed evaluation at our hospital revealed an absence of previous suicide attempts, substance use, body image disturbance or disturbance of sexual identity. There were no past/present psychotic or schizophrenia symptoms. A diagnosis of Recurrent Depressive Disorder with Moderate Depressive Episode and Complicated Grief Reaction (CGR) was made. Psychological assessment with projective tests revealed multiple conflicts regarding heterosexual relationships. As he had come prepared for only a brief admission, Behavior Therapy was initiated with a focus on grief resolution. He was initiated on Tab.Mirtazapine 15-30mg per day. Individual therapy to work on conflict areas was planned. At discharge, he reported improvement in low mood and sleep. He was scheduled for follow-up in a month's time.

1227,"The relationship of person-specific eveningness chronotype, greater seasonality, and less rhythmicity to suicidal behavior: A literature review","Background: Epidemiological data have demonstrated seasonal and circadian patterns of suicidal deaths. Several reviews and meta-analyses have confirmed the relationship between sleep disturbance and suicidality. However, these reviews/meta-analyses have not focused on seasonal and circadian dysfunction in relation to suicidality, despite the common presence of this dysfunction in patients with mood disorders. Thus, the current literature review analyzed studies investigating person-specific chronotype, seasonality, and rhythmicity in relation to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Methods: Study authors reviewed articles related to individual-level chronotype, seasonality, and rhythmicity and suicidality that were written in English and not case reports or reviews. Results: This review supports a relationship between an eveningness chronotype, greater seasonality, and decreased rhythmicity with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in those with unipolar depression, as well as in other psychiatric disorders and in children/adolescents. Limitations: These findings need to be explored more fully in mood disordered populations and other psychiatric populations, in both adults and children, with objective measurement such as actigraphy, and with chronotype, seasonality, and rhythmicity as well as broader sleep disturbance measurement all included so the construct(s) most strongly linked to suicidality can be best identified. Conclusions: Eveningness, greater seasonality, and less rhythmicity should be considered in individuals who may be at risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and may be helpful in further tailoring assessment and treatment to improve patient outcome.

Establishing the independent clinical significance of NES is imperative for it to be considered worthy of clinical attention. We compared students with and without NES on eating disorder symptomatology, quality of life, and mental health, while exploring the role of binge eating in associations.; Methods: Students (N = 1,636) ages 18-26 years (M = 20.9) recruited from 10 U.S. universities completed an online survey including the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Project Eating Among Teens, and the Health-Related Quality of Life-4. NES was diagnosed according to endorsement of proposed diagnostic criteria on the NEQ. Groups (NES vs. non-NES) were compared on all dependent variables and stratified by binge eating status in secondary analyses.; Results: The prevalence of NES in our sample was 4.2%; it decreased to 2.9% after excluding those with binge eating. Body mass index did not differ between groups, but students with NES were significantly more likely to have histories of underweight and anorexia nervosa. In students with NES, EDE-Q scores were significantly higher; purging, laxative use, and compulsive exercise were more frequent; quality of life was reduced; and histories of depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and self-injury were more common. Binge eating did not account for all of these differences; the presence of it and NES was associated with additive risk for psychopathology on some items.; Conclusions: NES may be a distinct clinical entity from other DSM-5 eating disorders.; Copyright Â© 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

1229,"Premenstrual tension among nurses in Nairobi, Kenya","A sample of 400 nurses at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi were interviewed by means of investigator-administered questionnaire to determine the prevalence and some other aspects of premenstrual tension (PMT) amongst them. Premenstrual tension (PMT) syndrome was found in 95.5% of the study group, with mastalgia being the commonest symptom (79.0%) followed by abdominal bloating (75.0%). Some features such as suicidal tendencies, inability to cope, insomnia were found to be rare among them. There was no correlation between age, marital status, parity, or dysmenorrhoea and premenstrual tension. Almost all the nurses with PMT, did not consider it an illness, rather as normal part of their femininity. As a result only 6.5% of them had changed their activities during this period, and only 3.1% had used medication for it. It is concluded that premenstrual tension is prevalent among women in Kenya, and that because of their attitude towards it, the condition does not appear to be associated with any serious morbidity.;Nursing Staff, Hospital*, Premenstrual Syndrome/*epidemiology, Adolescent, Adult, Age Distribution, Female, Humans, Kenya/epidemiology, Middle Aged, Premenstrual Syndrome/physiopathology, Premenstrual Syndrome/prevention & control, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Sampling Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Surveys and Questionnaires","Rupani, N P & Lema, V M",0,1229
1230,"Sleep problem, suicide and self-harm in university students: AÂ systematic review","Suicide and self-harm behaviours represent public health concerns, and university students are a particularly high risk group. Identifying modifiable risk factors for the development and maintenance of suicidal thoughts and behaviours is a research priority, as prevention is crucial. Research examining the relationship between poor sleep and self-harm/suicidality within university students is, for the first time, systematically evaluated, critically appraised, and synthesised. This literature consistently demonstrates that insomnia and nightmares are associated with elevated suicide risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours within this subpopulation of young adults. However, as findings are predominantly derived from cross-sectional investigations, the directionality of this relationship is not yet clear. While research investigating the psychological processes driving these relationships is in its infancy, preliminary findings suggest that thwarted belongingness, socio-cognitive factors and emotional dysregulation could be partly responsible. Methodological limitations are highlighted and a research agenda suggesting the key directions for future research is proposed. Continued research in this area - employing longitudinal designs, and testing novel theoretically derived hypotheses - will be crucial to the development of suicide prevention and intervention efforts.; Crown Copyright Â© 2019.

1231,Insomnia and Nightmares as Markers of Risk for Suicidal Ideation in Young People: Investigating the Role of Defeat and Entrapment,"Study Objectives: Although converging evidence has identified sleep problems as robust predictors of suicidal ideation in young people, the psychological processes driving these associations are not yet known. The current study aimed to test predictions, informed by the Integrated Motivational-Volitional (IMV) Model of Suicidal Behavior, concerning the role of feelings of defeat and entrapment within the sleep-suicide relationship.; Methods: Volunteers aged 15 to 17 years (n = 1,045) from Scottish secondary schools completed an anonymous self-report survey assessing insomnia symptoms, nightmares, suicidal ideation, depressive symptomology, and feelings of defeat and entrapment.; Results: Both insomnia symptoms and nightmares were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation (independent of depression). Perceptions of both defeat and entrapment were elevated in young people who reported clinically salient insomnia and/or nightmares, relative to those who did not. The relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation was fully mediated by perceptions of defeat and entrapment, whereas nightmares were indirectly associated with suicidal ideation through perceptions of defeat and entrapment.; Conclusions: Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the psychological mechanisms linking sleep disturbance and suicidality by highlighting the role of defeat and entrapment. Clinically, these findings have the potential to improve suicide risk assessment and prevention in young people experiencing difficulties with their sleep.; Â© 2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.adolescence, insomnia, nightmares, self-harm, sleep disturbance, suicide","Russell, Kirsten; Rasmussen, Susan & Hunter, Simon C.",1,1231
1232,Evaluation of patients with chronic headache,"Most chronic headache syndromes can be identified by conducting a careful interview that yields a thorough understanding of the patient's headache experience. The interview should explore the PQRST of the pain: provocation, quality, region, strength and time course, with the last element being the most helpful. Associated symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting in migraine, can be clues to the etiology. A list of all current medicines and the frequency of use should be obtained, since overuse of various analgesics can convert paroxysmal migraine into chronic daily headache. Psychosocial issues should be addressed, since depression can manifest as chronic headache. Changes in mood, energy, appetite, sleep, libido, enjoyments and suicidal ideation (represented by the acronym MEASLES) can indicate depression. A neurologic examination is important, and any focal findings warrant tomographic imaging of the brain. Findings on physical examination, however, are usually normal in patients with chronic headache. Laboratory and imaging studies are of most value when targeted to elucidate potential diagnoses raised by the detailed interview.;Headache*/complications, Headache*/etiology, Aged, Chronic Disease, Humans, Male, Risk Factors","Ryan, C W",0,1232
1233,Perceived discrimination is associated with the inflammatory response to acute laboratory stress in women at risk for cardiovascular disease,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and exacts a disproportionate toll on minorities. Growing evidence demonstrates that perceived discrimination is a significant contributing factor to psychological distress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and cardiovascular health. However, little is known regarding the extent to which perceived discrimination contributes to the inflammatory response to acute stress. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of perceived discrimination on the inflammatory response to a laboratory acute stress paradigm in women at risk for CVD. A cross-sectional sample of 99 postmenopausal women (50 African American and 49 non-Hispanic White) (mean age 60.2 years) with at least two risk factors for CVD underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Subjects completed the Detroit Area Study Discrimination Scale (DAS-DS) Everyday Discrimination subscale and provided blood and saliva samples prior to the TSST and every 15 min up to 90 min post-TSST to measure a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6). Perceived discrimination was significantly associated with the salivary IL-6 response to the TSST (b = 0.49, SE = 0.13, p = <0.001) controlling for age, race, marital status, household income, BMI, statin use, childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, and subjective social status. Women who reported higher levels of perceived discrimination had higher levels of salivary IL-6 at baseline and following the TSST as compared to women who reported lower levels of perceived discrimination. Results suggest that higher levels of perceived discrimination, regardless of race and socioeconomic status, may heighten levels of inflammation, prior to and following an acute stress exposure. The circulating Il-6 response was associated with BMI only and did not correlate with salivary IL-6. These data suggest that perceived discrimination may contribute to the salivary-IL-6 acute stress response. However, more research is needed to help clarify the complex relationships among stress and salivary proinflammatory cytokines","Saban KL; Mathews HL; Bryant FB; Tell D; Joyce C; DeVon HA; Witek Janusek L,",0,1233
1234,Quality of sleep: Associations with antiretroviral nonadherence,"Poor quality of sleep (QOS) is frequently reported in HIV-positive individuals; however, despite its clinical and public health significance, few studies have examined the correlation between QOS and antiretroviral (ARV) adherence. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of sleep disturbances, determine the characteristics of those with poor QOS, and establish the relationship between QOS and ARV nonadherence among HIV-positive individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of 2845 HIV-positive adults taking ARV therapy from the Healthy Living Project baseline cohort. Mean self-reported ARV nonadherence was estimated using a 3-day measure. QOS was assessed using three questions regarding sleep pattern changes, amount of bother from difficulty falling/staying asleep, and amount of bother from vivid dreams. Over 68% of individuals reported sleep pattern changes, 50.3% reported difficulty falling/staying asleep, and 20.5% reported bother from vivid dreams. Depression, suicidal ideation, unemployment, use of illicit substances, history of incarceration, and HIV viral load were all independently associated with poor QOS. Individuals reporting feeling bothered about difficulty falling/staying asleep had a 1.66 higher odds of nonadherence (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 2.33; p = 0.004). Those reporting the highest degree of bother from difficulty falling/staying asleep and from vivid dreams had a 1.42 (95% CI = 1.13, 1.78;  p = 0.002) and 1.31 (95% CI = 0.98, 1.75; p = 0.07) higher odds of nonadherence, respectively. With higher incremental reports of poor QOS there were considerable increases in ARV nonadherence. Recognition and timely treatment of sleep difficulties may result in reduced ARV nonadherence with beneficial clinical and public health implications.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large extraaxial tumor in the left middle fossa. Left temporal craniotomy was performed, achieving complete tumor resection. The patient showed signs of confusion, disorientation, and severe depression 3 days after the surgery. She developed insomnia and auditory hallucinations along with expressed suicidal ideation, then deteriorated rapidly, necessitating a transfer to a psychiatric unit. In spite of the intensive treatment with antidepressive and antipsychotic medications, she continued to have prolonged psychotic symptoms and depression for several months after surgery.; Conclusion: Although the incidence is rare, psychiatric complications should be anticipated in patients undergoing resection of a large skull base tumor affecting the temporal lobe.

Patients were evaluated at baseline, weekly from 1 to 9 weeks, and then after 12, 16, and 20 weeks of treatment, using Hamilton rating scale for depression-17 items (HAMD) scale.; Results: Fourteen patients with TRD completed the 20-week open trial with quetiapine. The augmentation with quetiapine significantly reduced total scores and scores listed in the anxiety subscale on the HAMD, and these effects were observed after the fourth week of treatment, while the depressed mood scores were significantly reduced after the fifth week of treatment. Quetiapine add-on treatment significantly decreased the scores listed in the insomnia subscale on the HAMD subscale after the second week of treatment.; Conclusion: Our preliminary data indicate that quetiapine add-on therapy appears to have beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with TRD.;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Dibenzothiazepines/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Quetiapine Fumarate, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome","Sagud, Marina; MihaljeviÄ‡-Peles, Alma; MÃ¼ck-Seler, Dorotea; JakovljeviÄ‡, Miro & Pivac, Nela",0,1236
1237,Appetite and weight loss symptoms in late-life depression predict dementia outcomes,"Objective: Identify depression symptoms during active late-life depression (LLD) that predict conversion to dementia. Methods: The authors followed a cohort of 290 participants from the Neurocognitive Outcomes of Depression in the Elderly study. All participants were actively depressed and cognitively normal at enrollment. Depression symptom factors were derived from prior factor analysis: anhedonia and sadness, suicidality and guilt, appetite and weight loss, sleep disturbance, and anxiety and tension. Cox regression analysis modeled time to Alzheimer disease (AD) and non-AD dementia onset on depression symptom factors, along with age, education, sex, and race. Significant dementia predictors were tested for interaction with age at depression onset. Results: Higher scores on the appetite and weight loss symptom factor were associated with an increased hazard of both AD and non-AD dementia. This factor was moderated by age at first depression onset, such that higher scores were associated with higher risk of non-AD dementia when depression first occurred earlier in life. Other depression symptom factors and overall depression severity were not related to risk of AD or non-AD dementia. Conclusion: Results suggest greater appetite/weight loss symptoms in active episodes of LLD are associated with increased likelihood of AD and non-AD dementia, but possibly via different pathways moderated by age at first depression onset. Results may help clinicians identify individuals with LLD at higher risk of developing AD and non-AD dementia and design interventions that reduce this risk.

1238,"Confirmation of the neurophysiologically predicted therapeutic effects of trazodone on its target symptoms depression, anxiety and insomnia by postmarketing clinical studies with a controlled-release formulation in depressed outpatients","Early human pharmaco-EEG and subsequent sleep laboratory studies identified trazodone, a 5-HT(2) antagonist and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SARI), as an antidepressant with therapeutic effects on its target symptoms depressed mood, anxiety and insomnia. On the occasion of the introduction of a controlled-release (CR) formulation (Trittico 150 mg retard, marketed in Austria by CSC Pharmaceuticals Handels GmbH, Vienna, Austria) in Austria in July 2000, a multi-center, open, clinical post-marketing study on the therapeutic effects, safety and target symptoms of trazodone CR in depression was carried out at 80 offices of Austrian neuropsychiatrists. 549 outpatients (63% females) of all age groups suffering from five different subtypes of depression were enrolled in the study. After a 2-week fixed dose-titration regimen up to 150 mg and a 4-week adjustment period to the optimum dose, 66% of the patients remained on 150 mg, 20% increased the dose and 11% decreased it. Only 3.7% discontinued treatment. Rating by the neuropsychiatrists based on the Clinical Global Impression showed very much to much improvement in 78.3% of the patients, and no change or a deterioration in only 3.6%. In the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) a statistically significant improvement from a baseline score of 21 to a score of 14 after 2 weeks was found, and a normalization to a score of 8 after 6 weeks. Therapeutic effects were similar in the five groups suffering from different subtypes of depression and in patients with and without comedication. Self-rating by the patients based on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) also showed a significant improvement in the 2nd and 6th week of therapy. Evaluation of the target symptoms of trazodone by ranking the most improved symptoms identified insomnia as the most improved psychopathological item in all three scales. While in the observer ratings also suicidal tendencies and weight loss were found much improved, in the self-rated Zung SDS sadness and loss of drive came second and third in the improvement ranking, in the self-rated Zung SAS anxiety and the feeling of falling apart. Tolerability was very good. In the 2nd week only 16.9% and in the 6th week only 7.6% of the patients reported side effects, mostly characterized by tiredness and rarely by nausea and vertigo. The present clinical study is in agreement with previous studies identifying trazodone as a safe and effective antidepressant, specifically regarding its target symptoms insomnia, depression and anxiety.

1239,Perceived Value of a Program to Promote Surgical Resident Well-being,"Objective: The demands of surgical residency are intense and threaten not only trainees' physical wellness, but also risk depression, burnout, and suicide. Our residency program implemented a multifaceted Balance in Life program that is designed to improve residents' well-being. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the program utilization and perceived value by residents.; Design, Setting, Participants: Residents (n = 56, 76% response rate) were invited to participate in a voluntary survey from December 2013 to February 2014 regarding utilization, barriers to use, and perceived value of 6 program components (refrigerator, After Hours Guide, psychological counseling sessions, Resident Mentorship Program, Class Representative System, and social events). They were also asked questions about psychological well-being, burnout, grit, and sleep and exercise habits before and after implementation of the program.; Results: The most valued components of the program were the refrigerator (mean = 4.61) and the psychological counseling sessions (mean = 3.58), followed by social events (mean = 3.48), the Resident Mentorship Program (mean = 2.79), the Class Representative System (mean = 2.62), and the After Hours Guide (mean = 2.10). When residents were asked how they would allocate $100 among the different programs, the majority was allocated to the refrigerator ($54.31), social events ($26.43), and counseling sessions ($24.06). There was no change in psychological well-being or burnout after the program. Residents had higher levels of grit (Î² = 0.26, p < 0.01) and exercised (Î² = 1.02, p < 0.001) and slept (Î² = 1.17, p < 0.0001) more after the program was implemented.; Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a multifaceted program to improve the well-being of trainees is feasible, highly valued, and positively perceived by the residents.

However the rates of these conditions in the New Zealand population are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the rates of sleep disorders, depression and anxiety, and identify correlations between satisfactions with life among university students in Auckland.; Method: Auckland Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ) was administered to undergraduate students from six schools of The University of Auckland. The different types of sleep disorders were calculated for the students who reported a significant sleep problem lasting more than 1 month. The rate of depression, anxiety and substance use as well as the satisfaction with life scale scores were also calculated for the whole cohort.; Results: A total of 1933 students were invited to participate and 66.8% completed the questionnaire. The median age was 20 years (range 16-38) and women represented 63.9% of the total group. A total of 39.4% of the students surveyed reported having significant sleep symptoms lasting longer than 1 month. The most prevalent causes for sleep symptoms were depression and anxiety. Delayed sleep phase disorder was found in 24.9% of students and parasomnias were reported by 12.4%. Depression and anxiety were present in 17.3% and 19.7% of the total group respectively, and 7.3% of students had thoughts of being better off dead"" or self-harm. A total of 15.5% students were found to have a CAGE score greater than or equal to 2 and 9.3% reported using recreational drugs in the last 3 months. Moderate negative correlations between SWLS scores and depression and anxiety were found (r=-0.45 and r=-0.37 respectively).; Conclusion: A large number of university students are suffering from significant sleep symptoms. Mood disorders substance use and circadian rhythm disorders can greatly contribute to sleep difficulties in this population group. The study also showed that harmful alcohol and drug use was common among this population group and is associated with clinically significant depression and anxiety.

This study aims to explore the frequencies of NSSI as well as the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, and sleep problems among 889 Palestinian adolescents and young adults. The participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI, PTSS, depression, anxiety symptoms, and sleep difficulties. The results found that 13.8% of the total sample are frequently engaging in some form of NSSI behavior. Moreover, 43.1% exhibited severe symptoms of PTSD, and almost one-third of the sample reported severe symptoms of depression (30.1%); more than two-thirds of the sample (68.4%) experience sleep difficulties. Those who engage in NSSI were found to be at higher risk for sleep problems, depression, and PTSS. Avoidance/numbing, as well as hyperarousal symptoms clusters of PTSS, were significantly associated with NSSI above and beyond depressive symptoms. These results suggest that NSSI is frequently a sequelae of prolonged exposure to trauma and violence, and highlight the importance of routine assessment of this behavior. It is crucial to be familiar with the association between PTSS, sleep difficulties, and NSSI in a clinical setting to implement programs focusing on preventing these domains.

1245,The effect of sleep disturbances and internet addiction on suicidal ideation among adolescents in the presence of depressive symptoms,"Maladaptive use of internet and sleep problems is a significant health concern among adolescents. We aimed to understand better how sleep problems are related to suicidal ideation taking into account the presence of depression and internet addiction. 631 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 randomly recruited from different middle and high schools to complete self-report questionnaires assessing sleep disturbances, addictive use of the internet, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. 22.9% of the sample reported on suicidal ideation during the month before the study, 42% of the sample suffer from sleep disturbances, 30.2% reported on the addictive use of the internet, and 26.5% exhibited severe symptoms of depression. Adolescents with suicidal ideation had higher rates of sleep disturbances, addictive use of internet and depressive symptoms. A confirmatory path analysis suggests that the effect of sleep disturbances on suicidal ideation moderated by the impact of internet addiction and mediated by the sleep effects on depressive symptoms. These results emphasize the importance to address the above risk behaviors in prevention curriculums programs.

1246,Safety in long-term EEG/video monitoring,"The goal of epilepsy monitoring is to capture several seizures, utilizing continuous electroencephalography (EEG)/video for later analysis. Various provocative techniques, such as withdrawing antiepileptic drugs or sleep deprivation are used to precipitate seizures. Patients run a higher risk of injuries due to having an increase in seizure frequency and/or intensity or a change in seizure type. Evaluating the potential for, and preventing injuries is an important part of risk management. However, very little information has been published regarding safety issues in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). Several types of safety issues have been identified during monitoring: uncontrolled behavior (ictal and post-ictal aggression, self injurious behavior, psychosis); seizure related injuries (falls, status epilepticus); problems related to electrodes (pulling out scalp and surgically implanted electrodes); and specific concerns regarding children in the EMU. Use of restraints and sitters in selected patients, appropriate medication for psychosis, shock absorbing carpet and child-proofing"" rooms for the young are among the preventative actions discussed. Central to risk management is the education of the staff in the assessment of each patient's potential for injury and use the appropriate interventions. Consideration should be given to balancing the need to avert harm with an unrestricted environment.;""Safety*, Videotape Recording*, Electroencephalography/*adverse effects, Epilepsy/*diagnosis, Child, Electroencephalography/methods, Electroencephalography/nursing, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Monitoring, Physiologic, Risk Factors[Formatter not found: ResolvePDF] ","Sanders, P T; Cysyk, B J & Bare, M A",0,1246
1247,Nightmares as predictors of suicide: an extension study including war veterans,"Nightmares are intensive dreams with negative emotional tone. Frequent nightmares can pose a serious clinical problem and in 2001, Tanskanen et al. found that nightmares increase the risk of suicide. However, the dataset used by these authors included war veterans in whom nightmare frequency - and possibly also suicide risk - is elevated. Therefore, re-examination of the association between nightmares and suicide in these data is warranted. We investigated the relationship between nightmares and suicide both in the general population and war veterans in Finnish National FINRISK Study from the years 1972 to 2012, a dataset overlapping with the one used in the study by Tanskanen et al. Our data comprise 71,068 participants of whom 3139 are war veterans. Participants were followed from their survey participation until the end of 2014 or death. Suicides (Nâ€‰=â€‰398) were identified from the National Causes of Death Register. Frequent nightmares increase the risk of suicide: The result of Tanskanen et al. holds even when war experiences are controlled for. Actually nightmares are not significantly associated with suicides among war veterans. These results support the role of nightmares as an independent risk factor for suicide instead of just being proxy for history of traumatic experiences.; Warfare*, Dreams/*psychology, Suicide/*psychology, Veterans/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, Risk Factors","Sandman, Nils; Valli, Katja; Kronholm, Erkki; Vartiainen, Erkki; Laatikainen, Tiina & Paunio, Tiina",1,1247
1248,Sensitivity of the individual items of the Hamilton depression rating scale to response and its consequences for the assessment of efficacy,"The Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D(17)) has been the gold standard in depression trials since its introduction in 1960 by Max Hamilton. However, several authors have shown that the HAM-D(17) is multi-dimensional and that subscales of the HAM-D(17) outperform the total scale. In the current study, we assess the sensitivity of the individual HAM-D(17) items in differentiating responders from non-responders over the typical treatment period used in clinical efficacy trials. Based on data from randomised, placebo-controlled trials with paroxetine, a graphical analysis and a statistical analysis were performed to identify the items that are most sensitive to the rate and extent of response irrespective of treatment. From these analyses, two subscales consisting of seven items each were derived and compared to the Bech and Maier and Philip subscales using a linear mixed-effects modelling approach for repeated measures. The evaluation of two clinical trials revealed endpoint sensitivity comparable to the existing subscales. Using a bootstrap technique, we show that the subscales consistently yield higher statistical power compared to the HAM-D(17), although no subscale consistently outperforms the others. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that not all items of the HAM-D(17) scale are equally sensitive to detect responding patients in a clinical trial. A HAM-D(7) subscale with higher sensitivity to drug effect is proposed consisting of the HAM-D(6) and the suicide item. This response-based subscale increases signal-to-noise ratio and could reduce failure rate in efficacy trials with antidepressant drugs.;Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/*statistics & numerical data, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Double-Blind Method, Endpoint Determination, False Negative Reactions, Humans, Linear Models, Longitudinal Studies, Paroxetine/therapeutic use, Placebos, Psychometrics, Psychomotor Agitation/psychology, Research Design/standards, Sensitivity and Specificity, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology, Suicide/psychology, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome","Santen, Gijs; Gomeni, Roberto; Danhof, Meindert & Della Pasqua, Oscar",0,1248

1250,Koro Syndrome: A Case Report,"Reports a case of a koro-like syndrome in a 49-year-old Moroccan male. When he presented to the mental health centre, he complained of pain in his penis and spontaneous shrinking towards the abdomen with a persistent sensation of strain, forcing him to adopt certain postures to alleviate the discomfort. He also described headache, depressive mood and apathy, anorexia, insomnia at night and somnolence and clinophilia during the day. There were no hallucinations or other delusional beliefs. He had no suicidal thoughts. With intramuscular neuroleptic treatment his pain and concerns about penis retraction subsided except for a sensation of strain, which disappeared during sleep. We emphasized the importance of follow-up treatment and he kept regular appointments and continued treatment even during holidays in Morocco. As he continued to appear depressed, however, with persistent clinophilia, social isolation and headache, we added a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressant citalopram at 30-60 mg daily. This was started after seven months of neuroleptic treatment when both follow-up and medication compliance were assured and a good therapeutic relationship firmly established. With this added treatment his headaches improved, but he continued to appear depressed and reported low mood, which he related to his family's rejection. There were no other clear depressive symptoms such as suicidal thoughts, circadian influence, insomnia or anorexia that might point to an endogenous disorder, nor evidence of alcohol abuse.

1251,Psychosis in a methadone-substituted patient during interferon-alpha treatment of hepatitis C,"Interferon-alpha (IFN-Î±) is the only effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B and C. Over â…”s of methadone-substituted patients suffer from chronic hepatitis C but a history of psychiatric disorders or drug addiction is still seen as a contraindication for IFN-Î± because of a possible increased risk of severe psychiatric side effects such as depression, suicide attempts or psychotic episodes. This study reports on the case of a 33-year-old patient with chronic hepatitis C and a positive psychiatric history (drug abuse, borderline personality, and 4 suicide attempts). After 4 mo of therapy with IFN-Î±, he developed a psychosis with persecution mania, complex thought disorder, disturbance of sexual identity, sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, and increased irritability with suicidal thoughts. Symptoms did not disappear after discontinuation of interferon treatment. To the authors' knowledge, there are no other reports of persistent psychosis with a possible association with interferon treatment. Development of psychosis and other psychiatric side-effects may be an indication of possible neuromodulatory effects of IFN-Î± with long-term treatment. Ideas for safer treatment in methadone patients with psychiatric comorbidity and chronic hepatitis C are needed.

1252,HIV-infected mental health patients: Characteristics and comparison with HIV-infected patients from the general population and non-infected mental health patients,"Objectives: HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing mental health symptoms, which negatively influence the treatment of the HIV-infection. Mental health problems in HIV-infected patients may affect public health. Psychopathology, including depression and substance abuse, can increase hazardous sexual behaviour and, with it, the chance of spreading HIV. Therefore, it is important to develop an optimal treatment plan for HIV-infected patients with mental health problems. The majority of HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands (almost 60%) are homosexual men. The main objectives of this study were to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with HIV who seek treatment for their mental health symptoms in the Netherlands. Secondly, we tested whether HIV infected and non-infected homosexual patients with a lifetime depressive disorder differed on several mental health symptoms. Methods: We compared a cohort of 196 patients who visited the outpatient clinic for HIV and Mental Health with HIV-infected patients in the general population in Amsterdam (ATHE-study) and with non-HIV infected mental health patients (NESDA-study). DSM-IV diagnoses were determined, and several self-report questionnaires were used to assess mental health symptoms. Results: Depressive disorders were the most commonly occurring diagnoses in the cohort and frequent drug use was common. HIV-infected homosexual men with a depressive disorder showed no difference in depressive symptoms or sleep disturbance, compared with non-infected depressive men. However, HIV-positive patients did express more symptoms like fear, anger and guilt. Although they showed significantly more suicidal ideation, suicide attempts were not more prevalent among HIV-infected patients. Finally, the HIV-infected depressive patients displayed a considerably higher level of drug use than the HIV-negative group. Conclusion: Habitual drug use is a risk factor for spreading HIV. It is also more often diagnosed in HIV-infected homosexual men with a lifetime depression or dysthymic disorder than in the non-infected population. Untreated mental health problems, such as depressive symptoms and use of drugs can have serious repercussions. Therefore, general practitioners and internists should be trained to recognize mental health problems in HIV-infected patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1253,Hepatitis C treatment in patients with drug addiction: clinical management of interferon-alpha-associated psychiatric side effects,"60-90% of patients with intravenous drug abuse are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) plus ribavirin is often complicated by psychiatric adverse events, significantly affecting patients adherence. Depression, anxiety, fatigue and irritability as typical IFN-alpha associated side effects occur in 30-80% during antiviral treatment of hepatitis C. Patients with drug addiction were shown to have an increased risk to discontinue HCV-treatment early in the first three treatment months, where most neuropsychiatric side effects appear. Especially vegetative side effects in the first few weeks (flu-like syndrome"") can be misunderstood as withdrawal symptoms followed by a relapse in drug or alcohol abuse. As a consequence methadone substitution treatment was found to be the best therapeutic setting. In addition side effect management should be intensified during first three months of HCV-treatment. Most data for the management of specific IFN-alpha associated side effects are available for depressive syndromes. Antidepressants (especially serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors) such as citalopram were shown to significantly reduce IFN-alpha associated depressive symptoms. A pre-emptive treatment with antidepressants should be considered at least for patients with additional psychiatric risk factors before interferon-based therapy is started. Because data from prospective controlled trials are lacking management of other side effects such as sleep disturbances irritability psychotic syndromes mania suicidal thoughts and delirious syndromes should follow general psychiatric treatment recommendations. Overall the psychiatric adverse event profile of interferon-based therapy for HCV-infected patients with drug addiction is considerable and requires active management and knowledge about psychiatric medical therapy.;""Accession Number: 19630716.

1254,Self-poisoning suicide deaths in people with bipolar disorder: characterizing a subgroup and identifying treatment patterns,"Objective: To characterize self-poisoning suicide deaths in BD compared to other suicide decedents.; Methods: Extracted coroner data from all suicide deaths (nÂ =Â 3319) in Toronto, Canada from 1998 to 2012. Analyses of demographics, clinical history, recent stressors, and suicide details were conducted in 5 subgroups of suicide decedents: BD self-poisoning, BD other methods, non-BD self-poisoning, non-BD other methods, and unipolar depression self-poisoning. Toxicology results for lethal and present substances were also compared between BD and non-BD self-poisoning subgroups as well as between BD and unipolar depression self-poisoning subgroups.; Results: Among BD suicide decedents, self-poisoning was significantly associated with female sex, past suicide attempts, and comorbid substance abuse. In both the BD and non-BD self-poisoning groups, opioids were the most common class of lethal medication. For both groups, benzodiazepines and antidepressants were the most common medications present at time of death, and in 23% of the BD group, an antidepressant was present without a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. Only 31% of the BD group had any mood stabilizer present, with carbamazepine being most common. No antidepressant, mood stabilizer, or antipsychotic was present in 15.5% of the BD group. Relative to unipolar depression self-poisoning group, the BD self-poisoning group evidenced higher proportion of previous suicide attempt(s) and psychiatry/ER visits in the previous week.; Conclusion: People with BD who die by suicide via self-poisoning comprise a distinct but understudied group.

1255,Efficacy and safety of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics for chronic insomnia in patients with bipolar disorder,"Background: Insomnia in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) can cause distress, daytime dysfunction, cognitive impairment, worsening of hypomanic/manic symptoms and increased suicide risk. Physicians often prescribe hypnotics for BD patients with insomnia although no hypnotic has a specific FDA indication for this use. In this study, the patterns of use, efficacy and safety of five nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (NBZHs) were assessed in a large group of outpatients with BD. Method: A chart review was performed for all older adolescents and adult BD outpatients in a private outpatient clinic. Clinical data was collected for any patient who had ever been prescribed a NBZH for insomnia and included successful current use, past unsuccessful treatments, side effects, duration of use, concurrent psychiatric medications, and absence or presence of untoward events often associated with chronic use of hypnotics. Results: A significant number of BD patients take NBZHs as needed or on a daily basis. Four NBZHs had adequate success rates; ramelteon was limited in efficacy. Some patients experienced satisfactory results from a NBZH after unsuccessful trials with one or more other NBZHs. About half of the current NBZH users are taking them on a daily long-term basis, and none of these patients have experienced unacceptable untoward events. About three quarters of the chronic NBZH users are taking antimanic medications concurrently, and less than half of the chronic users are taking antidepressants. Limitations: The results may not be generalizable to other BD populations. A control group was not included in the design. Chronic users of NBZHs were not asked to discontinue their NBZH in order to confirm indication for long-term use. Conclusions: Most NBZHs can be effective and safe agents for selected BD outpatients with episodic or chronic insomnia. Failure to respond to one or more NBZH does not preclude a satisfactory response to a different NBZH. Some BD patients who take maintenance antimanic agents also require NBZH treatment. Overactivation from antidepressant treatment does not contribute to chronic NBZH use in most BD patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1256,"Pregabalin for anxiety in patients with schizophrenia - A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study","Introduction: Anxiety is frequent in patients with schizophrenia and poses a major impact on patients perceived quality of life, daily functioning and risk of suicide. Pregabalin has shown effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and has been suggested for the treatment of anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. As evidence is sparse regarding treatment of anxiety in this patient group, we aimed to investigate the use of pregabalin for anxiety in patients with schizophrenia.; Methods: A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study was used. Patients were randomized to either placebo or pregabalin (â‰¤600mg/d) as add-on treatment. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat based with change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale after 4 and 8weeks of treatment as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were change in psychopathology, quality-of-life, cognitive functioning and sleep. The study used centralized raters to increase accuracy and minimize baseline inflation.; Results: A total of 54 patients were included with 46 completing the study. Pregabalin reduced the HAM-A6 score significantly compared to placebo and with a medium effect size 0.72 (p=0.01). No significant between-group difference was found for the overall HAM-A14. Most common side-effects were weight gain, dizziness, sedation and increased duration of sleep.; Conclusions: Although no effect was found on overall HAM-A14, pregabalin might be effective in the treatment of psychic anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with a medium effect size.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

1257,New insights into the mechanisms of antidepressant therapy,"Depressive disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric diseases in the Western world with prevalence numbers between 9% and 18%. They are characterized by depressed mood, a diminished interest in pleasurable activities, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, decrease in appetite and libido, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Among other findings, reduced activity of monoaminergic neurotransmission has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Consistent with this hypothesis, most antidepressive drugs exert their action by elevating the concentration of monoamines in the synaptic cleft. However, it is not the enhancement of monoaminergic signaling per se, but rather long-term, adaptive changes that may underlie the therapeutic effect. These include functional and structural changes that are discussed later. In addition, in the last years, evidence has emerged that remissions induced in patients using lithium or electroconvulsive therapy are accompanied by structural changes in neuronal networks thereby affecting synaptic plasticity in various regions of the brain.; Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology, Animals, Biogenic Monoamines/metabolism, Brain/metabolism, Brain/physiopathology, Depressive Disorder/metabolism, Depressive Disorder/physiopathology, Depressive Disorder/therapy, Electroconvulsive Therapy, Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism, Neuronal Plasticity","Schloss, Patrick & Henn, Fritz A.",0,1257

She endorsed sleep-deprived energy enhancement, unfulfilled goal-oriented productivity, hyper-talkativeness, hyper-sexuality and increased nicotine use. Concurrent depressive symptoms included hopelessness, worthlessness, poor concentration, lack of appetite, and ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts that she may kill herself or her child. She exhibited pressured speech, affective lability, expansiveness, distractibility, and tangential, grandiose, delusional self-referential content. Transient thoughts of self-harm and harm to her child were not associated with intent. Her family history was significant for a deceased mother who had bipolar I disorder. The patient was hospitalized for 5Â days and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type I, current episode manic with psychotic features with a mixed-feature specifier.

Duloxetine is one of three medications currently FDA approved for use in FMS management. Duloxetine is a mixed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that functions by increasing central nervous system levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. This review is a primer on use of duloxetine in FMS management and includes information on pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, a review of the three duloxetine FMS treatment trials currently in publication, a discussion of the safety and tolerability of duloxetine, and patient-focused perspectives on duloxetine use in FMS management. Duloxetine has proven efficacy in managing pain and mood symptoms in adult FMS patients with and without major depressive disorder. However, due to side effects, duloxetine must be used with caution in patients with fatigue, insomnia, gastrointestinal complaints, headache, cardiovascular disease, bleeding-risk, and in those 24 years of age and younger due to risk of suicidality. Duloxetine use should be avoided in patients with liver disease or alcoholics.

However, empirical studies on nightmare content in larger samples are scarce.; Methods: The current study elicited 1,216 of the most recent nightmares including childhood nightmares of a population-based sample.; Results: The findings show that nightmares encompass a diversity of different topics, being chased, physical aggression, including death/injury of close persons. Infrequent themes like being the aggressor and suicide are of special interest as they might be related to waking-life psychopathology.; Conclusions: The variety of nightmare topics clearly indicate that current definitions of nightmare content are too narrow.

Other psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the following rating scales: impact of event scale (IES) Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) and for anxiety (HAM-A) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Effects of PIMSMA and PTSD level of psychological distress were analyzed using ANOVA and for change over time for continuous variables repeated measured multivariate analyses was performed and for categorical variables nonparametric-related sample McNemar. Logistic regression for variable associated with PTSD was performed.; Results: Out of 213 eligible injured survivors evacuated to our ER 129 were retrieved 3-9 months after the incident and 53 were available for assessment 2 years later. Multivariate analyses for being PTSD vs non-PTSD at the first evaluation being hospitalized OR = 5.6 (95 percent CI 1.1-27.6) and treated OR = 24.5 (95 percent CI 2.8-200) were the only predictors with no effect (p = 0.9) for PIMSMA vs other supportive intervention. Predictor for PTSD at the second evaluation were IES severity score at first evaluation OR = 1.1 (95 percent CI 1.04-1.2).; Conclusion: The PIMSMA approach is as good as the nonspecific supportive treatment performed routinely in the ED with all survivors of traumatic events of any origin.

1262,Alcohol-use disorders,"Alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse or harmful use cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Alcohol-use disorders are associated with depressive episodes, severe anxiety, insomnia, suicide, and abuse of other drugs. Continued heavy alcohol use also shortens the onset of heart disease, stroke, cancers, and liver cirrhosis, by affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune systems. Heavy drinking can also cause mild anterograde amnesias, temporary cognitive deficits, sleep problems, and peripheral neuropathy; cause gastrointestinal problems; decrease bone density and production of blood cells; and cause fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol-use disorders complicate assessment and treatment of other medical and psychiatric problems. Standard criteria for alcohol dependence-the more severe disorder-can be used to reliably identify people for whom drinking causes major physiological consequences and persistent impairment of quality of life and ability to function. Clinicians should routinely screen for alcohol disorders, using clinical interviews, questionnaires, blood tests, or a combination of these methods. Causes include environmental factors and specific genes that affect the risk of alcohol-use disorders, including genes for enzymes that metabolise alcohol, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase; those associated with disinhibition; and those that confer a low sensitivity to alcohol. Treatment can include motivational interviewing to help people to evaluate their situations, brief interventions to facilitate more healthy behaviours, detoxification to address withdrawal symptoms, cognitive-behavioural therapies to avoid relapses, and judicious use of drugs to diminish cravings or discourage relapses.;Alcoholism*/complications, Alcoholism*/epidemiology, Alcoholism*/physiopathology, Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium/*physiopathology, Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium/*rehabilitation, Brain/*drug effects, Ethanol/*metabolism, Ethanol/*pharmacology, Ethanol/adverse effects, Female, Humans, International Classification of Diseases, Male, Surveys and Questionnaires","Schuckit, Marc A",0,1262

Subjects in the varenicline arm had a significantly higher 7-day point prevalence of SLT abstinence at 12 weeks (48% vs. 33%; RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.22-1.72, p < .0001, I2 = 0%; RD = 13%, 95% CI = 4%-23%, p = .008) but not at 26 weeks (49% vs. 39%; RR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.93-2.03, p = .11, I2 = 51%). There were no statistically significant differences in the incidences of adverse events between the 2 arms but interpretation is limited by high heterogeneity.; Conclusion: This pooled analysis suggests that varenicline is effective in achieving a 7-day point prevalence of SLT abstinence at 12 weeks but showed that this effect was not sustained at 26 weeks.; Â© The Author 2015.

1264,Can an Integrated Science Approach to Precision Medicine Research Improve Lithium Treatment in Bipolar Disorders?,"Clinical practice guidelines identify lithium as a first line treatment for mood stabilization and reduction of suicidality in bipolar disorders (BD); however, most individuals show sub-optimal response. Identifying biomarkers for lithium response could enable personalization of treatment and refine criteria for stratification of BD cases into treatment-relevant subgroups. Existing systematic reviews identify potential biomarkers of lithium response, but none directly address the conceptual issues that need to be addressed to enhance translation of research into precision prescribing of lithium. For example, although clinical syndrome subtyping of BD has not led to customized individual treatments, we emphasize the importance of assessing clinical response phenotypes in biomarker research. Also, we highlight the need to give greater consideration to the quality of prospective longitudinal monitoring of illness activity and the differentiation of non-response from partial or non-adherence with medication. It is unlikely that there is a single biomarker for lithium response or tolerability, so this review argues that more research should be directed toward the exploration of biosignatures. Importantly, we emphasize that an integrative science approach may improve the likelihood of discovering the optimal combination of clinical factors and multimodal biomarkers (e.g., blood omics, neuroimaging, and actigraphy derived-markers). This strategy could uncover a valid lithium response phenotype and facilitate development of a composite prediction algorithm. Lastly, this narrative review discusses how these strategies could improve eligibility criteria for lithium treatment in BD, and highlights barriers to translation to clinical practice including the often-overlooked issue of the cost-effectiveness of introducing biomarker tests in psychiatry.; biomarkers, bipolar disorders, lithium, mood stabilizers, personalized, phenotype, prediction, response","Scott, Jan; Etain, Bruno & Bellivier, Frank",0,1264

Six subjects had indeterminate HIV-1 antibody results and were excluded from the study. The remaining 194 subjects of whom 101 (52.1%) knew about their sero-status and were consecutively recruited, whereas, 93 (47.9%) did not know about their sero-status and were recruited by a systematic random sampling method (1-in-3). They were then interviewed about neuropsychiatric disorders using BPRS, MADRS, AUDIT and MINI Mental State Test, including the risk factors related to HIV infection. After ELISA tests' results, the two groups were combined and then categorised into HIV positive (n=115) and HIV negative (n=79) subjects.; Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence, neuropsychiatric disorders, increased CD4 cell counts and risk factors associated with HIV infection.; Results: The findings were that the overall point prevalence of the HIV infection was 59.3% (115/194). Comparative analyses between seropositive and seronegative HIV/AIDS subjects showed: over two thirds (71.3%) of the HIV positive subjects suffered from psychiatric disorders, more than those with HIV negative 44.3% (OR=3.12, 95% CI=1.64-5.95, P=0.0002), and subjects aged 35 years and less were mostly HIV seronegatives (n=77.2%, OR=2.34, 95% CI=1.18-4.75, P=0.014). The overall prevalence of alcohol use/misuse was 41 (21.1%), with higher prevalence rate among HIV positive subjects, 28 (24.3%) than those who were HIV negative, 13 (16.5%). The commonest psychiatric symptoms/signs (P<0.05) were emotional withdrawal, depressed mood, suspiciousness, apparent sadness, reduced sleep and suicidal thoughts (especially among women).; Conclusion: There is very high point prevalence of HIV/AIDS and psychiatric disorders, including a moderate prevalence rate of alcohol use/misuse in this less affluent community that warranted intervention.;Alcoholism/*epidemiology, HIV Infections/*epidemiology, Mental Disorders/*epidemiology, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/epidemiology, Adolescent, Adult, Alcoholism/complications, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, HIV Infections/complications, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders/complications, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Zimbabwe/epidemiology","Sebit, M B; Tombe, M; Siziya, S; Balus, S; Nkomo, S D A & Maramba, P",0,1265
1266,Psychological aspects in brain tumor patients: A prospective study,"Objective: Very few studies have utilized specific criteria to assess mental disorders in brain tumor patients, and from them, they are mainly descriptive. The purpose of this study is to examine mental disorders in relation to tumor characteristics and patients' psychosocial factors using DSM-IV (depression, sleep and mood) criteria, among brain tumor patients.; Materials and Methods: From March 2009 to July 2011, 98 patients who surgically treated with intracranial neoplasm were included in this prospective study. The mean age of the patient group was 42.2 years with a range of 18-60 years with a male to female ratio of 1.2. The most common tumor type was glioblastoma multiform (30.3%), followed by meningioma (16.8%) and anaplastic glioma (12.3%).; Results: In our study, the prevalence of mild depression was about 30% for males and 38% for females before surgery; however at 3 months after surgery, this amount decreased to the amount of 25.6% and 26% for male and female patients respectively. Before tumor operation, the prevalence of major depression was 10.4% for males and 19.7% for females. At 3 months after operation the prevalence of major depression was 12.8% for males, and 6.7% for females. Aggression or suicide attempts were not seen related to depression. Before operative intervention, severe anxiousness as well as severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms was present in 14.7% of males while at 3 months after operation, prevalence of severe anxiousness and severe OCD symptoms decreased to 4% and 9.3% respectively. In females, 28.7% of the subjects had reported to have severe anxiousness and 25.6% severe OCD symptoms. Three months after surgery, these amounts were 17.6% and 38.7% respectively.; Conclusion: Depressive symptoms as well as anxious and OCD psychopathology were shown to be prevalent signs among patients with brain tumor. Diagnosis of the previous mentioned symptoms were totally based on DSM-IV criteria and these disorders and the percentiles don't seem to be related to each other. Due to high variability of tumor stages, statistical analysis of whether the mentioned psychiatric symptoms get worsen at the later stages of the tumor genesis was not feasible. Although not measured directly, mentioned psychiatric symptoms seem to get worsen at the later stages of the brain tumor. The associated factors are tumor location, patient's premorbid psychiatric status, cognitive symptoms and adaptive or maladaptive response to stress.; ","Seddighi, Afsoun; Seddighi, Amir Saied; Nikouei, Amir; Ashrafi, Farzad & Nohesara, Shabnam",1,1266
1267,¦ He always slaps me on my ears': The health consequences of intimate partner violence among a group of patrilineal women in Ghana,"Intimate partner violence has implications for womenâ€™s health globally. Patrilineal women have been shown to have increased risk of experiencing intimate partner violence, yet, the health consequences of intimate partner violence in patrilineal women have not been thoroughly explored or documented. This study used qualitative in-depth interviews to explore the health effects of intimate partner violence among 15 ever-partnered Ghanaian patrilineal women. Participants attributed violence to several factors including gendered domestic relations, cultural and marital rites and alcohol use, among other factors. Abused women reported health problems such as feelings of worthlessness, sleeplessness, suicidal ideation, eye injuries, bodily weakness, hypertension, genital sores and the premature termination of pregnancy. Policy makers should pay particular attention to intimate partner violence-related health consequences in designing health interventions for abused women.

1269,Deep Brain Stimulation in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: Effect on Psychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life,"Background and Study Aims: â€ƒTo determine the effect on psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of both subthalamic nuclei (STN) after 1 year of follow-up.; Material and Method: â€ƒWe conducted a prospective 1-year follow-up study with a baseline assessment before and 6 and 12 months after surgery. The following were used as assessment instruments: the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (MES), the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale (MAS), the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Oviedo Sleep Questionnaire (OSQ), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the dose of levodopa, and the active contact stereotactic coordinates.; Results: We recorded a clinical improvement between baseline with medication use (ON medication) and the results obtained at 6 and 12 months with medication use and stimulation (ON stimulation, ON medication) in MES and OSQ (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) and in SF-36 (pâ€‰<â€‰0.005). No changes were observed in MAS and SSI. There was a clinical improvement between baseline with ON medication and the results obtained at 12 months with ON stimulation, ON medication in Y-BOCS (pâ€‰<â€‰0.04). Also, there was a 53.3% reduction in levodopa at 6 months and a 54.7% reduction at 12 months after surgery (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). There was an improvement between baseline with OFF medication and the results obtained at 6 and 12 months OFF medication, ON stimulation (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) in UPDRS-III.

1270,Chronic sleep disturbances and borderline personality disorder symptoms,"Objective: Few studies have examined the experience of chronic sleep disturbances in those with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and further establishing this association may be pertinent to enhancing current treatments, given the relevance of sleep to emotion regulation and stress management. Method: Data were analyzed (N = 5,692) from Part II of the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) sample (Kessler & Merikangas, 2004), which assessed personality disorders and sleep problems. Rates of chronic sleep disturbances (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and waking earlier than desired), as well as the consequences of poor sleep, were examined. Indices for BPD diagnosis and symptoms were used in logistic and linear regression analyses to predict sleep and associated problems after accounting for chronic health problems, Axis I comorbidity, suicidal ideation over the last year, and key sociodemographic variables. Results: BPD was significantly associated with all 3 chronic sleep problems assessed, as well as with the consequences of poor sleep. The magnitude of the association between BPD and sleep problems was comparable to that for Axis I disorders traditionally associated with sleep problems. BPD symptoms interacted with chronic sleep problems to predict elevated social/emotional, cognitive, and self-care impairment. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are consistently associated with BPD symptoms, as are the daytime consequences of poor sleep. There may also be a synergistic effect where BPD symptoms are aggravated by poor sleep and lead to higher levels of functional impairment. Sleep in patients with BPD should be routinely assessed, and ameliorating chronic sleep problems may enhance treatment by improving emotion regulation and implementation of therapeutic skills.

1271,What dreams may come: Emotional cascades and nightmares in borderline personality disorder,"People diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have been found to have a number of sleep problems, including frequent and distressing nightmares. The experience of nightmares is likely to worsen emotion dysregulation and decrease coping abilities the subsequent day, making it an important issue for clinicians to address. One recent theoretical model of BPD psychopathology, the Emotional Cascade Model (ECM), may shed light on this phenomenon by characterizing nightmares as the experience of emotional cascades that occur during sleep. A model is presented in which these cascades may carry over from a stressful day and lead to elevated cognitive activity during sleep, as well as nightmare-like phenomena. To test this model we used experience sampling from 47 participants exhibiting dysregulated behaviors--16 of them diagnosed with BPD. Negative emotion, rumination, and number of nightmares were assessed daily across two consecutive weeks. Analyses indicated that the BPD group experienced more frequent nightmares, that BPD diagnosis interacted with baseline trait rumination to prospectively predict number of nightmares reported during monitoring, and daily experience of emotional cascades predicted subsequent number of nightly nightmares. These findings held after controlling for key covariates, including sleep quality and diagnoses of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Important clinical interventions consistent with the ECM conceptualization of nightmares are proposed, including the potential for management of daily rumination and negative emotion, imagery rescripting for recurrent or anxiously anticipated nightmares, and potential prescription of prazosin (an alpha1-adrenergic antagonist) for the reduction of nightmares in this group.

1272,Overcoming the fear of lethal injury: evaluating suicidal behavior in the military through the lens of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide,"Suicide rates have been increasing in military personnel since the start of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and it is vital that efforts be made to advance suicide risk assessment techniques and treatment for members of the military who may be experiencing suicidal symptoms. One potential way to advance the understanding of suicide in the military is through the use of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide. This theory proposes that three necessary factors are needed to complete suicide: feelings that one does not belong with other people, feelings that one is a burden on others or society, and an acquired capability to overcome the fear and pain associated with suicide. This review analyzes the various ways that military service may influence suicidal behavior and integrates these findings into an overall framework with relevant practical implications. Findings suggest that although there are many important factors in military suicide, the acquired capability may be the most impacted by military experience because combat exposure and training may cause habituation to fear of painful experiences, including suicide. Future research directions, ways to enhance risk assessment, and treatment implications are also discussed.; Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

1273,"Associations between chronotype, sleep quality, suicidality, and depressive symptoms in patients with major depression and healthy controls","Research interest concerning associations between sleep characteristics and suicidality in psychopathology has been growing. However, possible linkages of suicidality to sleep characteristics in terms of sleep quality and chronotypes among depressive patients have not been well documented. In the current study, the authors investigated the possible effects of sleep quality and chronotype on the severity of depressive symptoms and suicide risk in patients with depressive disorder and healthy controls. The study was conducted on 80 patients clinically diagnosed with major depression and 80 healthy subjects who were demographically matched with the patient group. All participants completed a questionnaire package containing self-report measures, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), and Suicide Ideation Scale (SIS), and subjects were interviewed with the suicidality section of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results are as follows: (a) logistic regression analyses revealed that poor sleep quality and depression symptom severity significantly predicted onset of major depression; (b) morningness-type circadian rhythm may play as a significant relief factor after onset of major depression; (c) sleep variables of chronotype and sleep quality did not significantly predict suicide ideation after controlling for depressive symptoms in the major depression group; and (d) suicide ideation and poor sleep quality were antecedents of depression symptom severity in patients with major depression, and in healthy controls. Findings are discussed under the theoretical assumptions concerning possible relations between chronotype, sleep quality, depression, and suicidality.

1274,Attempted suicide: Varieties of pre-suicidal and post-suicidal states,"Considers attempted suicide along psychological, psychiatric, and epidemiological lines. 221 attempted suicide cases were classified on a clinical psychiatric basis, according to 1 of 3 groups--serious, ambivalent, and gesture--based on components of the presuicidal state: aim, motivation, communication, projective and introjective identification, mood shift, pattern of insomnia, degree of pain threshold, symbolism of suicidal act, and relief reaction (postsuicidal state). Epidemiological characteristics of the 3 groups were considered. The serious group increased with age and resembled a Canadian suicide population. Actuarial profiles of the MMPI were used to assess the type of suicide attempt and risk. Suicide attempts were rooted in a complexity of factors, described by MMPI scales 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. Higher T score of the Mf(5) scale indicated a serious suicide attempt. These profiles, compared with a nonsuicidal control group, were significantly different. Accuracy in identification of serious attempts was also significant. Results indicate that suicidal potential and type of attempt are correlated along psychological and psychiatric dimensions and can be objectively tested with the MMPI.

We also examined whether sleep disturbances and duration mediated the relationship between last media use time and mood disturbances. Methods: This cross-sectional, school-based, online survey was administered by the Sleep Center at Samsung Medical Center and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) in 2011. A total of 26,395 participants (12,593 male and 13,802 female) were recruited from 150 middle and high schools representative of nationwide adolescents from 15 administrative districts in Korea. The sleep habits of participants on weekdays and weekends were evaluated using a questionnaire. Sleep disturbances, depression, and suicidality were assessed using the Korean versions of the Global Sleep Assessment Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Beck 19-item Scale for Suicide Ideation. We also collected last media use time, from which we subtracted actual bedtime. Results: Late electronic media use was significantly associated with increased mood disturbances including depression and suicidality directly, but not indirectly via sleep duration or disturbances. Conclusion: Our results suggest that adolescents might benefit from the restricted use of electronic media after bedtime in terms of their mood and sleep. Moreover, education regarding media use at night might be helpful in preventing youth suicide.

1276,Agitated depression in bipolar disorder," It has been suggested that agitated depression (AD) is a common, severe feature in bipolar disorder. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of AD and investigate whether presence of AD was associated with episodic and lifetime clinical features in a large well-characterised bipolar disorder sample.Method: The prevalence of agitation, based on semi-structured interview and medical case-notes, in the most severe depressive episode was estimated in 2925 individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder recruited into the UK Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Predictors of agitation were ascertained using symptoms within the same episode and lifetime clinical features using multivariate models.Results: 32.3% (n=946) experienced agitation during the worst depressive episode. Within the same episode, significant predictors of presence of agitation were: insomnia (OR 2.119, p<.001), poor concentration (OR 1.966, p=.027), decreased libido (OR 1.960, p<.001), suicidal ideation (OR 1.861, p<.001), slowed activity (OR 1.504, p=.001), and poor appetite (OR 1.297, p=.029). Over the lifetime illness course, co-morbid panic disorder (OR 2.000, p<.001), suicide attempt (OR 1.399, p=.007), and dysphoric mania (OR 1.354, p=.017) were significantly associated with AD.Conclusions: Agitation accompanied bipolar depression in at least one-third of cases in our sample and was associated with concurrent somatic depressive symptoms, which are also common features of mixed manic states. Furthermore, AD in our sample was associated with lifetime experience of mixed mania, in addition to severe lifetime illness course including comorbid panic disorder and suicidal behaviour. Our results have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of agitated features in bipolar depression.","Serra F; Gordon-Smith K; Perry A; Fraser C; Di Florio A; Craddock N; Jones I; Jones L,",1,1276
1277,Depressive syndrome in major psychoses: a study on 1351 subjects,"The aim of this study was to investigate depressive symptomatology across distinct major psychiatric disorders. A total of 1351 subjects affected by major depressive disorder (MDD = 389), bipolar disorder (BP = 511), delusional disorder (DD = 93) and schizophrenia (SKZ = 358) were included in our study. Subjects were assessed using the Operational Criteria for Psychotic Illness checklist (OPCRIT). The most frequently represented depressive symptoms in MDD were Loss of energy/tiredness, Loss of pleasure, Poor concentration, and Sleep disorders. Compared with MDD, BP had higher occurrences of Agitated activity, Excessive sleep, and Increased appetite and/or Weight gain, as well as lower Loss of pleasure. In our sample, 32.3% and 26.8% of DD and SKZ, respectively, had quite consistent depressive symptomatology, with at least four or more depressive symptoms. The most common depressive symptoms were Sleep disorders, Poor concentration and Loss of energy/Tiredness, followed by Psychomotor symptoms in SKZ only. Excessive self-reproach, Suicidal ideation, and Appetite and/or Weight changes were more specific to mood disorders. Finally, compared with SKZ, DD suffered from more depressive symptoms and had more severe depressive symptomatology.

Victims responded that bullying and undermining is carried out by those senior or at least close in the hierarchy. Of the 278 consultants who answered the question on 'frequency of occurrence', 50% stated that bullying and undermining occurs on half, or more, of all encounters with perpetrators and two-thirds reported that it had lasted more than 3â€…years. The reported impact on professional and personal life spans a wide spectrum from suicidal ideation, depression and sleep disturbance, and a loss of confidence. Over half reported problems that could compromise patient care. When victims were asked if the problem was being addressed, 73% of those that responded stated that it was not.; Conclusions: Significant numbers of consultants in O&G in the UK are victims of bullying and undermining behaviour that puts their own health and patient care at risk.

1279,The effect of targeted and tailored patient depression engagement interventions on patient“physician discussion of suicidal thoughts: A randomized control trial,"Background: Despite improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of depression, primary care provider (PCP) discussion regarding suicidal thoughts among patients with depressive symptoms remains low. Objective: To determine whether a targeted depression public service announcement (PSA) video or an individually tailored interactive multimedia computer program (IMCP) leads to increased primary care provider (PCP) discussion of suicidal thoughts in patients with elevated risk for clinical depression when compared to an attention control. Design: Randomized control trial at five different healthcare systems in Northern California; two academic, two Veterans Affairs (VA), and one group-model health maintenance organization (HMO). Participants: Eight-hundred sixty-seven participants, with mean age 51.7; 43.9 % women, 43.4 % from a racial/ethnic minority group. Intervention: The PSA was targeted to gender and socio-economic status, and designed to encourage patients to seek depression care or request information regarding depression. The IMCP was an individually tailored interactive health message designed to activate patients to discuss possible depressive symptoms. The attention control was a sleep hygiene video. Main Measures: Clinician reported discussion of suicidal thoughts. Analyses were stratified by depressive symptom level (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ- 9] score < 9 [mild or lower] versus â‰¥ 10 [at least moderate]). Key Results: Among patients with a PHQ-9 score â‰¥ 10, PCP discussion of suicidal thoughts was significantly higher in the IMCP group than in the control group (adjusted odds ratio = 2.33, 95 % confidence interval = 1.5, 5.10, p = 0.03). There were no significant effects of either intervention on PCP discussion of suicidal thoughts among patients with a PHQ-9 score < 9. Conclusions: Exposure of patients with at least moderate depressive symptoms to an individually tailored intervention designed to increase patient engagement in depression care led to increased PCP discussion of suicidal thoughts.

Polysomnography (PSG) sleep studies in child and adolescent psychiatric populations, a particularly at risk group, has considerable value but has been more elusive requiring further investigation. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of PSG sleep studies and psychiatrist evaluations of 106 adolescents aged 7-16 admitted to an involuntary adolescent psychiatric inpatient facility. Results: Less than 5% of cases had mild/no sleep problems. Hyperarousal hallmarked this population, and severity of sleep disturbances trends with the severity of psychopathology. Inpatients with multiple psychiatric disorders had greater frequencies of insomnia, decreased sleep efficiency, and arousals from SWS (p < 0.05). Inpatient's with self-harm behavior more frequently had elevated sleep onset latency (SOL), reduced efficiency, reduced SWS (p < 0.05), increased REM, and reduced REM latency compared to inpatients with dysthymia and/or depression. Limitations: Lacking an a priori hypothesis, this study was explorative and uncontrolled for factors such as medications. This notwithstanding however, analysis indicates the majority of inpatients were taking cocktails that â€œshouldâ€ alleviate sleep symptoms suggesting greater associations may prevail in unmedicated populations. Conclusions: This study attests to the potential clinical utility of PSG sleep studies in the management of adolescent psychiatric disorders and contributes to the body of evidence reputing the intimate connection between sleep problems and the development and perpetuation of psychopathology with public health implications.

1281,"The relationship between lifetime suicide attempts, serum lipid levels, and metabolic syndrome in patients with bipolar disorders","Objectives: To assess the relationship between lifetime suicide attempts (SAs), serum lipid values, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with bipolar disorders (BPD). Methods: Eighty patients with BPD took part in the study (M = 40.60 years). After psychiatric diagnosis, demographic data, SAs, and serum lipids were measured and MetS was calculated. Results: 70% reported at least one suicide attempt. 52.5% suffered from MetS. Suicide attempters had higher cholesterol values. SAs were associated with a family history of suicide, current mood state, and lower educational level. SAs were unrelated to MetS. Conclusions: In patients with BPD, against expectations, the occurrence of SAs was associated with higher cholesterol values. Serum lipid values are not suitable as a biological trait marker to predict SAs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1282,Adjunctive sleep medications and depression outcome in the treatment of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor resistant depression in adolescents study,"Objective: In the Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescents, study participants who received medication for sleep had a lower response rate. This report sought to clarify this finding. Method: Depressed adolescents who had not responded to a previous adequate serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) trial were randomly assigned to another SSRI, venlafaxine, another SSRI + cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), or venlafaxine + CBT. Augmentation with sleep medication was permitted as clinically indicated. Results: Youth who received trazodone were six times less likely to respond than those with no sleep medication (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05-0.50, p = 0.001) and were three times more likely to experience self-harm (OR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.1-7.9, p = 0.03), even after adjusting for baseline differences associated with trazodone use. None (0/13) of those cotreated with trazodone and either paroxetine or fluoxetine responded. In contrast, those treated with other sleep medications had similar rates of response (60.0% vs. 50.4%, Ï‡Â² = 0.85, p = 0.36) and of self-harm events (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.1-2.6, p = 0.53) as those who received no sleep medication. Conclusions: These findings should be interpreted cautiously because these sleep agents were not assigned randomly, but at clinician discretion. Nevertheless, they suggest that the use of trazodone for the management of sleep difficulties in adolescent depression should be re-evaluated and that future research on the management of sleep disturbance in adolescent depression is needed. The very low response rate of participants cotreated with trazodone and either fluoxetine or paroxetine could be due to inhibition of CYP 2D6 by these antidepressants.

1283,Considerations in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder during and after pregnancy,"There are conflicting data on the course of bipolar disorder during pregnancy but childbirth is generally considered a time of high risk for the onset or exacerbation of mood and psychotic episodes in women with bipolar disorder. Despite the increasing use of psychotropic drugs in women with psychiatric disorders, there is a paucity of information in the pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder during and after pregnancy. Optimal drug treatment requires an understanding of the illness course prior to, during, and after pregnancy; bipolar disorder type and dominant polarity, psychiatric comorbidity, physical health status, prior response to psychotropic drugs, effectiveness of medications in the acute and preventative treatment of mood episodes, side effect profile including teratogenicity, and finally family history of psychiatric illness. For women who discontinue psychotropic drugs abruptly upon finding out about the pregnancy, the withdrawal symptoms of medications should be distinguished from the symptoms of the disorder. Compatibility of drugs with breastfeeding is another important consideration. Antidepressants should be avoided as much as possible due to their association with manic switches, rapid cycling, and suicidality. An important aspect of pharmacotherapy in women with a personal or family history of bipolar I disorder or postpartum psychosis should be the management of insomnia that can either be an early symptom of, or a trigger for postpartum manic/mixed or psychotic episodes. Whereas polypharmacy may be unavoidable, every effort should be made to keep the overall number of medications and dosages to a minimum.;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/complications, Bipolar Disorder/physiopathology, Breast Feeding, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/complications, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/therapy, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology","Sharma, Verinder",0,1283
1284,Complicated grief and related bereavement issues for DSM-5,"Bereavement is a severe stressor that typically incites painful and debilitating symptoms of acute grief that commonly progresses to restoration of a satisfactory, if changed, life. Normally, grief does not need clinical intervention. However, sometimes acute grief can gain a foothold and become a chronic debilitating condition called complicated grief. Moreover, the stress caused by bereavement, like other stressors, can increase the likelihood of onset or worsening of other physical or mental disorders. Hence, some bereaved people need to be diagnosed and treated. A clinician evaluating a bereaved person is at risk for both over-and under-diagnosis, either pathologizing a normal condition or neglecting to treat an impairing disorder. The authors of DSM IV focused primarily on the problem of over-diagnosis, and omitted complicated grief because of insufficient evidence. We revisit bereavement considerations in light of new research findings. This article focuses primarily on a discussion of possible inclusion of a new diagnosis and dimensional assessment of complicated grief. We also discuss modifications in the bereavement V code and refinement of bereavement exclusions in major depression and other disorders.; Â© 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.Bereavement*, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, Grief*, Adjustment Disorders/*diagnosis, Adjustment Disorders/psychology, Chronic Disease, Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Risk Factors","Shear, M Katherine; Simon, Naomi; Wall, Melanie; Zisook, Sidney; Neimeyer, Robert; Duan, Naihua; Reynolds, Charles; Lebowitz, Barry; Sung, Sharon; Ghesquiere, Angela; Gorscak, Bonnie; Clayton, Paula; Ito, Masaya; Nakajima, Satomi; Konishi, Takako; Melhem, Nadine; Meert, Kathleen; Schiff, Miriam; O'Connor, Mary-Frances; First, Michael; Sareen, Jitender; Bolton, James; Skritskaya, Natalia; Mancini, Anthony D & Keshaviah, Aparna",0,1284
1285,Hypersomnia Associated with Isotretinoin in a Patient with Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder and Acne Vulgaris,"A case is presented in which an acute shift in sleep-disturbance extremes was reported by a patient shortly after the initiation of isotretinoin therapy. Mr. A, a 17-year-old Caucasian male with a history of recurrent major depressive disorder and acne vulgaris, was admitted to an in-patient acute care psychiatric hospital 3 months after isotretinoin therapy was initiated by a dermatologist. Mr. A reported that after 3 days of isotretinoin therapy his mood sharply declined and all of the previously reported depressive symptoms exacerbated with 1 notable exception. Unexpectedly, Mr. A reported that instead of experiencing severe sleep initiation and maintenance insomnia as he had before, he was now sleeping 14 to 15 hours per day. Upon Mr. A's admission to the in-patient psychiatric unit, the isotretinoin was discontinued, and the patient was placed under observation for safety due to his reports of suicidal ideation. After 3 days, the patient's depressive symptoms had drastically improved, and suicidal ideations had remitted. In addition, there was no longer evidence of hypersomnia, and the patient was able to function in scheduled activities. The purpose of this report is 2-fold. The first purpose of this report is to bring forth further awareness of the potential risk of using isotretinoin in patients with a positive history of clinically significant depression. Second, this report is intended to call attention to the possible effects of isotretinoin on sleep. At this time, knowledge of the effects of isotretinoin on sleep is quite limited.

With reference to the previous year, 32.7% of the students reported at least one form of DSH, 13.7% of the respondents had suicide thoughts, 4.9% devised specific suicidal plans, and 4.7% had actually attempted suicide. Adolescent girls had significantly higher rates of DSH and suicidal behavior than did adolescent boys. Having remarried parents was related to an increased likelihood of DSH and suicide. While high levels of family functioning, overall positive youth development, and academic and school performance predicted low rates of DSH and suicidal behavior, cognitive and behavioral competencies were unexpectedly found to be positively associated with DSH and suicidal behavior.

1287,Inpatient medical“surgical suicidal behavior: A 12-year case“control study,"Objective: To describe a medical center's 12-year experience with medically or surgically hospitalized suicide attempters, with the goal of extending the limited literature on this sentinel event. Patients and Methods: Eight Mayo Clinic Rochester patients' self-inflicting injuries serious enough to trigger mandatory reporting while hospitalized on a medical/surgical unit from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 were matched with four same-sex and same-age controls, admitted to the same unit within 2 months. Cases were identified from Sentinel Event Tracking System and Minnesota Adverse Events Statute records. Data were analyzed with conditional logistic regression. Results: Eight of 777,404 medical/surgical inpatients admitted during 12 years attempted suicide, with significantly more non-Caucasian patients among cases than controls (P = .020). Of 8 attempts, 1 was fatal. More cases than controls had undergone inpatient psychiatric evaluation prior to attempt (P = .020), and elevated risk of attempt was significantly associated with increased number of prior attempts (0.049). Near their attempts, each attempter had an identifiable stressor including inadequately controlled pain in 3, agitation and anxiety in 2 each, and acute delirium, insomnia and psychosocial difficulties in 1 each. Conclusion: First, this study's findings underscore the rarity of reported inpatient medical/surgical suicidal behavior. In this sample, suicide attempters were distinct from nonattempters by the increased likelihood of prior suicide attempts as well as inpatient psychiatric consultations before their attempts. When patients have these characteristics, medical teams should take particular notice and initiate heightened watchfulness for suicidal behavior.

There is little evidence available on the impact of these on the mental health of older Aboriginal Australians. This study enrolled 336 Aboriginal Australian participants over 60 years from 5 major urban and regional areas in NSW, utilizing a structured interview on social determinants, and life-time history of physical and mental conditions; current psychosocial determinants and mental health. Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to examine the link between these determinants and current depressive scores and suicidality. There was a high rate of life-time depression (33.3%), current late-life depression (18.1%), and suicidal ideation (11.1%). Risk factors strongly associated with late-life depression included sleep disturbances, a history of suicidal behaviour, suicidal ideation in late-life and living in a regional location.

This article describes the (a) process of implementing behavioral health screening at a university health center and (b) results of universal screening for depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol misuse, tobacco use, and sleep problems. We discuss the decision points involved in screening, including what to screen for, whom to screen, how to implement the screening measure, and how to deal with patients who screen positive. During the Spring and Fall 2010 academic semesters, 4,126 screening questionnaires were completed by students (62 % female) accessing a university health center. Each semester, 9-13 % of students screened positive for depression, 2.5-3 % for suicidal ideation, and 33-38 % for alcohol misuse, while 10 % wanted help with smoking cessation and 12-13 % with sleep problems. The results suggest that behavioral health screening in a university health center can help identify students with behavioral health concerns to increase access to care.

1291,The concept of post-traumatic mood disorder and its implications for adolescent suicidal behavior,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric disorder which is frequently comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD). It has been suggested that some or all individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD and MDD have a separate psychobiological condition that can be termed ''post-traumatic mood disorder'' (PTMD). The idea was based on the fact that a significant number of studies suggested that patients suffering from comorbid PTSD and MDD differed clinically and biologically from individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Individuals with comorbid PTSD and MDD are characterized by greater severity of symptoms and the higher level of impairment in social and occupational functioning compared to individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Neurobiological evidence supporting the concept of PTMD includes the findings from neuroendocrine challenge, cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging, sleep and other studies. It has been demonstrated that child abuse increases the risk for PTSD, MDD, and suicidal behavior in adolescents and adults. Many victims of childhood abuse develop comorbid PTSD and depression, i.e., they develop PTMD. PTMD is associated with suicidal behavior. The link between childhood abuse, suicidal behavior in adolescents and PTMD indicates that it is important to develop interventions to prevent PTMD in victims of child abuse; to develop measures to prevent suicidal behavior in adolescents with PTMD; and to study psychobiology of PTMD in order to develop treatments for PTMD. Priorities for intervening to reduce adolescent suicidal behavior lie with interventions focused upon the improved recognition, treatment and management of adolescents with psychiatric disorders including PTMD.;Child Abuse*, Depressive Disorder, Major*/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major*/epidemiology, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic*/diagnosis, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic*/epidemiology, Suicide*, Adolescent, Adult, Child, Comorbidity, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Humans, Risk Factors","Sher, L",0,1291

Approximately 30 armed conflicts are currently occurring around the globe, involving more than 25 countries. There are millions of war veterans around the world, many of whom are suffering from the psychological and/or physical wounds of war. Suicidal behavior is a major problem among war veterans. Many war veterans suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression or both disorders. Suicidal behavior among war veterans may frequently be related to depression and/or PTSD. The risk of suicide attempts among the PTSD population is six-times greater than in the general population and even higher among treatment-seeking war veterans with PTSD. The percentage of veterans who die from combat-related injuries is decreasing over time, suggesting that there is now a larger proportion of veterans living with the effects of their injuries.

1293,The concept of post-traumatic mood disorder,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently comorbid with depression. A number of studies have been conducted to compare individuals suffering from comorbid PTSD and depression with individuals suffering from PTSD alone or depression alone. Comorbidity of PTSD and depression is associated with more severe symptoms as well as higher levels of disability compared to individuals with PTSD alone. A severity of overall symptoms is three to fivefold greater in subjects with comorbid PTSD and depression compared to those with PTSD alone. The comorbid group is five times more likely to manifest functional impairment compared to those diagnosed with PTSD alone. Patients with comorbid PTSD and depression have higher depression, impulsivity, and hostility scores and are significantly more likely to make a suicide attempt compared to subjects with depression alone. Depressed subjects with comorbid PTSD tend towards earlier age of first hospitalization and a higher number of hospitalizations compared to depressed individuals without comorbid PTSD. Lower affinity of alpha-2 adrenoreceptors and higher plasma tyrosine availability to the brain are associated with comorbid PTSD and depression, but not with PTSD alone. Individuals with comorbid PTSD and depression do not exhibit the classic rapid eye movement sleep architectural modifications associated with depression, despite the fact that several other psychophysiological indices of dysphoria are detectable in their sleep. In fenfluramine challenge studies, depressed patients with comorbid PTSD have lower plasma cortisol compared to depressed patients without comorbid PTSD. Cortisol levels increase with age and the number of previous major depressive episodes is a predictor of the cortisol response to fenfluramine administration in depressed patients without PTSD, but not in depressed patients with comorbid PTSD. Depressed subjects with comorbid PTSD have higher cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid levels compared with depressed subjects without comorbid PTSD. Thus, studies suggest that patients suffering from comorbid PTSD and depression differ clinically and biologically from individuals with PTSD alone or depression alone. It is possible that some or all individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD and depression have a separate psychobiological condition that can be termed post-traumatic mood disorder"". Future clinical and neurobiological studies may not only advance our understanding of the role of environmental and genetic factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of stress-related disorders but also be useful in refining conceptions of stress-related disorders themselves and possible approaches to the treatment of these conditions.;""Accession Number: 15922089.

1294,A model of suicidal behavior in war veterans with posttraumatic mood disorder,"Many wars have been fought during the history of civilization. About 30 armed conflicts are occurring now around the globe involving more than 25 countries. Many war veterans have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) including suicidal ideation and behavior. PTSD is frequently comorbid with MDD. I have previously proposed that some or all individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD and MDD have a separate psychobiological condition that can be termed posttraumatic mood disorder"" (PTMD). This idea was based on the fact that a significant number of studies suggested that patients suffering from comorbid PTSD and MDD differed clinically and biologically from individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Individuals with comorbid PTSD and MDD are characterized by greater severity of symptoms increased suicidality and the higher level of impairment in social and occupational functioning compared to individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Neurobiological evidence supporting the concept of PTMD includes the findings from neuroendocrine challenge cerebrospinal fluid neuroimaging sleep and other studies. In this paper I propose a model of suicidal behavior in war veterans with PTMD. The model consists of the following components: (1) genetic factors; (2) prenatal development; (3) biological and psychosocial influences from birth to mobilization/deployment; (4) mobilization/pre-deployment stress; (5) combat stress traumatic brain injury and physical injury; (6) post-deployment stress; (7) biological and psychosocial influences after the deployment; (8) trigger (precipitant) of a suicidal act; and (9) suicidal act. The first four components determine vulnerability to combat stress. The first seven components determine predisposition to suicidal behavior a key element that differentiates PTMD patients who are at high risk from those at lower risk. Suicidal behavior in PTMD can be attributed to the coincidence of a trigger with a predisposition for suicidal behavior. Suicide prevention in war veterans with PTMD should focus on (1) improvement in recognition of PTMD; (2) treating symptoms of PTMD; (3) preventing a relapse when the patient is in remission; (4) treating suicidal ideation; (5) treating comorbid psychiatric conditions including alcohol and drug abuse; (6) treating medical and neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury; and (7) social support. It is extremely important to understand PTMD to optimize assessment and treatment for people with PTMD and to identify processes that facilitate recovery from exposure to traumatic events.

1295,Preventing suicide in post-traumatic stress disorder,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and severe psychiatric disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. PTSD is characterized by the presence of three distinct, but co-occurring, symptom clusters. Symptoms of reexperience involve spontaneous, often non-suppressible intrusions of the traumatic memory in the form of images or nightmares that are accompanied by intense physiological distress. Considerable evidence suggests that PTSD is associated with suicidal behavior. 'Suicidal act' refers to the occurrence of suicide attempts, which can be defined as self-directed injurious acts with at least some intent to end one's own life. Comorbid conditions such as depression and/or substance abuse increase suicidality in individuals with PTSD. It is critical to prevent suicide in PTSD. Prevention of suicidal behavior in PTSD includes (i) pharmacological and psychological treatment of PTSD (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of PTSD and PTSD comorbid with depression); (ii) treatment of comorbid conditions; (iii) treatment of suicidal ideation in persons with PTSD because suicidal ideation is a risk factor for completed suicide, and it is therefore a logical focus for intervention; (iv) social support; and (v) reduction in availability of lethal means, for example, firearms.

Sleep complaints such as insomnia, hypersomnia, nightmares, and sleep panic attacks are frequent in suicidal adolescents and adults. Sleep studies have reported various polysomnographic findings in suicidal patients with depression, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. Sleep difficulties should be considered in prevention and intervention efforts for patients at risk for suicide. Prevention efforts should target good sleep hygiene and early detection and treatment of problematic sleep patterns in order to decrease risk for suicide. Further studies are needed to investigate possible mechanisms of sleep disturbances in suicidal behavior.

Morbidity is also higher among smokers, who are more prone to bronchitis, emphysema, sinusitis, peptic ulcers, and influenza. Abuse of drugs, both prescribed and unprescribed, is linked directly to drug dependency and death, often suicide. Misuse of prescribed drugs is a major concern in the elderly.

1299,Clobazam for intractable pediatric epilepsy,"We report our experience with add-on clobazam therapy over a 5-year period in 63 children with refractory epilepsy. The mean duration of epilepsy was 6.7 years. Children were followed for 15 to 64 months. Of 63 children, 57 were developmentally delayed, and 54 had a symptomatic/cryptogenic epilepsy. Forty-one percent became either seizure free or had a greater than 90% reduction in seizure frequency. Seizure frequency was reduced 50% to 90% in another 24%. The average daily dose of clobazam was 0.8 mg/kg. Thirty-five percent had the medication withdrawn for persistent or unacceptable side effects or the development of tolerance (seven patients). Side effects included severe aggressive outbursts, hyperactivity, insomnia, and depression with suicidal ideation. Clobazam is a useful add-on medication for 65% of children with epilepsy.

1300,Aggression in children treated with clobazam for epilepsy,"Reports on 63 Canadian children treated with clobazam (CLB) for refractory epilepsy; after 5 yrs of treatment, 7 children developed severe behavior disorders characterized by aggressive agitation, self-injurious behavior, insomnia, and incessant motor activity occurring between 10 and 55 days after initiation of drug therapy. The affected children were relatively young, mean age 6.4 yrs, and developmentally disabled. The disorder occurred with a short latency after initiation of therapy and at a relatively low dosage of CLB. Serum levels of other coadministered antiepileptic drugs were unchanged by the administration of CLB. The behavioral deterioration required the discontinuation of CLB, after which Ss returned to their previous behavior within 3 wks. After more than 3 yrs of follow-up, all children continued to require multiple antiepileptic drugs, but none had a recurrence of this aggressive agitation.

1301,Benzodiazepine therapy in psychiatric outpatients is associated with deliberate self-poisoning events at emergency departments”A population-based nested case“control study,"Rationale: Deliberate self-poisoning (DSP), the most common form of deliberate self-harm, is closely associated with suicide. Identifying risk factors of DSP is necessary for implementing prevention strategies. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between benzodiazepine (BZD) treatment in psychiatric outpatients and DSP cases at emergency departments (EDs). Methods: We performed a retrospective nested caseâ€“control study of psychiatric patients receiving BZD therapy to evaluate the relationship between BZD use and the diagnosis of DSP at EDs using data from the nationwide Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Results: Regression analysis yielded an odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) indicating that the use of BZDs in psychiatric outpatients was significantly associated with DSP cases at EDs (OR = 4.46, 95 % CI = 3.59â€“5.53). Having a history of DSP, sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, depression, or bipolar disorder was associated with a DSP diagnosis at EDs (OR = 13.27, 95 % CI = 8.28â€“ 21.29; OR = 5.04, 95 % CI = 4.25â€“5.98; OR = 3.95, 95 % CI = 3.32â€“4.70; OR = 7.80, 95 % CI = 5.28â€“11.52; OR = 15.20, 95 % CI = 12.22â€“18.91; and OR = 18.48, 95 % CI = 10.13â€“ 33.7, respectively). After adjusting for potential confounders, BZD use remained significantly associated with a subsequent DSP diagnosis (adjusted OR = 2.47, 95 % CI = 1.93â€“3.17). Patients taking higher average cumulative BZD doses were at greater risk of DSP. Conclusion: Vigilant evaluation of the psychiatric status of patients prescribed with BZD therapy is critical for the prevention of DSP events at EDs.

1302,Predicting Suicidal Ideation in College Students with Mental Health Screening Questionnaires,"Objective: The present study aimed to identify risk factors for future SI and to predict individual-level risk for future or persistent SI among college students.; Methods: Mental health check-up data collected over 3 years were retrospectively analyzed. Students were categorized as suicidal ideators and non-ideators at baseline. Logistic regression analyses were performed separately for each group, and the predicted probability for each student was calculated.; Results: Students likely to exhibit future SI had higher levels of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, and significant risk factors for future SI included depression, current SI, social phobia, alcohol problems, being female, low self-esteem, and number of close relationships and concerns. Logistic regression models that included current suicide ideators revealed acceptable area under the curve (AUC) values (0.7-0.8) in both the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision recall (PR) curves for predicting future SI. Predictive models with current suicide non-ideators revealed an acceptable level of AUCs only for ROC curves.; Conclusion: Several factors such as low self-esteem and a focus on short-term rather than long-term outcomes may enhance the prediction of future SI. Because a certain range of SI clearly necessitates clinical attention, further studies differentiating significant from other types of SI are necessary.; Logistic models, Risk factors, Students, Suicidal ideation","Shim, Geumsook & Jeong, Bumseok",1,1302

The subjects (n = 171) were inpatients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, manic, between 2003 and 2010 and were classified into three groups: â€œmaniaâ€ (n = 67), â€œmania with probable mixed featuresâ€ (n = 79), and â€œmania with definite mixed featuresâ€ (n = 25). Diagnoses were in accordance with the Cincinnati criteria, which include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision characteristics for a major depressive episode, except for agitation and insomnia. The charts of subjects were retrospectively reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics prior to the index episode, clinical data regarding the index episode, and treatment courses over a 12-month follow-up period. Subjects in the mania with definite mixed features were more likely to be young at admission, to be female, to have a familial affective loading, and to have a history of suicidality relative to the mania. The results of the present study suggest the need for regular assessment of symptoms associated with both polarities during an episode in routine practice.

1304,The combined effect of subjective body image and body mass index (distorted body weight perception) on suicidal ideation,"Objectives: Mental health disorders and suicide are an important and growing public health concern in Korea. Evidence has shown that both globally and in Korea, obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing some psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we examined the association between distorted body weight perception (BWP) and suicidal ideation.; Methods: Data were obtained from the 2007-2012 Korea National Health and Nutritional Evaluation Survey (KNHANES), an annual cross-sectional nationwide survey that included 14 276 men and 19 428 women. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between nine BWP categories, which combined body image (BI) and body mass index (BMI) categories, and suicidal ideation. Moreover, the fitness of our models was verified using the Akaike information criterion.; Results: Consistent with previous studies, suicidal ideation was associated with marital status, household income, education level, and perceived health status in both genders. Only women were significantly more likely to have distorted BWP; there was no relationship among men. In category B1 (low BMI and normal BI), women (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 3.42) were more likely to express suicidal ideation than women in category B2 (normal BMI and normal BI) were. Women in overweight BWP category C2 (normal BMI and fat BI) also had an increased OR for suicidal ideation (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.48 to 3.42). Those in normal BWP categories were not likely to have suicidal ideation. Among women in the underweight BWP categories, only the OR for those in category A2 (normal BMI and thin BI) was significant (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.59).; Conclusions: Distorted BWP should be considered an important factor in the prevention of suicide and for the improvement of mental health among Korean adults, especially Korean women with distorted BWPs.; Body Mass Index*, Body Image/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Body Weight, Cross-Sectional Studies, Demography, Female, Health Status, Humans, Income, Interviews as Topic, Logistic Models, Male, Marital Status, Mental Health, Middle Aged, Nutrition Surveys, Obesity/psychology, Odds Ratio, Sex Factors, Social Class, Socioeconomic Factors, Suicidal Ideation, Young Adult, Body image, Body mass index, Obesity, Suicidal ideation, Suicide, Weight perception","Shin, Jaeyong; Choi, Young; Han, Kyu-Tae; Cheon, Sung-Youn; Kim, Jae-Hyun; Lee, Sang Gyu & Park, Eun-Cheol",0,1304
1305,Psychiatric Consultations at an Emergency Department in a Metropolitan University Hospital in Northern Japan,"Many patients with mental disorders visit emergency departments (EDs). However, the majority of these patients do not receive psychiatric assessment. In the present study, we investigated the detailed proportion of patients with mental disorders visiting an urban ED in the largest northern city in Japan. A retrospective chart review study was performed at a University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2015. The reasons for psychiatric consultations made by ED staff, and the primary psychiatric diagnoses were investigated. Among all living patients, 20% of them received consultations. The most common reason for consultation was suicide attempt followed by agitation or insomnia. Of all diagnoses, organic mental disorder was the most frequent and the mean age was significantly higher than the other diagnostic groups. Our study indicated that the frequency of psychiatric consultation was high. This indicates the high demand for mental health services at the ED. A thorough psychiatric assessment can provide adequate psychiatric services to acute patients; thereby possibly preventing suicide attempters from later actually dying by suicide.;  Psychiatric assessment, Psychiatric consultation, Psychiatric emergency, Suicide, Emergency department","Shiraishi, Masaki; Ishii, Takao; Kigawa, Yoshiyasu; Tayama, Masaya; Inoue, Keisuke; Narita, Kenji; Tateno, Masaru & Kawanishi, Chiaki",0,1305
1306,A case of psychotic depression treated with fluvoxamine monotherapy,"In this study, the authors describe the case of a 30-year old woman who in February 2008 began to experience obsessive thinking centered around the thought that she was harmful to her husband. She also had suicidal ideation. Four months later, her symptoms dramatically worsened, and she was brought to an outpatient clinic, suffering from depressed mood, guilt, suicidal ideation, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of interest, psychomotor retardation, anxiety and paranoid symptoms. Also, the content of her delusional ideas had mood-congruent psychotic features. She was started on the antidepressant fluvoxamine and the hypnotic brotizolam. Her mental and somatic condition gradually stabilized, and the frequency and degree of her paranoid symptoms decreased. Three months later, her mood and level of interest had returned to normal, and she was not experiencing mental or somatic anxiety. She found it easier to perform her daily activities, such as cooking and cleaning, and was once again enjoying her life. The authors report that fluvoxamine monotherapy was effective in a Japanese female patient with psychotic depression. However, further studies using large numbers of patients are needed before it can be concluded that fluvoxamine monotherapy is effective in patients with psychotic depression.

1307,The mediating role of sleep disturbances in the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder and self-injurious behavior,"Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with self-injurious behavior, it is currently unclear what mechanisms may account for this relationship. Sleep disturbances may be relevant as they are common among those with PTSD and are associated with emotion regulation difficulties, which may increase vulnerability to self-injurious behavior. As such, we investigated the relationship between PTSD and self-injurious behaviors, and the mediating roles of nightmares and insomnia. Hypotheses were tested cross-sectionally in a sample of psychology clinic outpatients (N = 255). Participants completed a structured clinical interview assessing PTSD and self-report questionnaires measuring insomnia, nightmares, and self-injurious behaviors (i.e., Have you ever cut, burned, or scratched yourself on purpose?). PTSD was associated with self-injurious behavior after covarying for depression, and nightmare severity mediated the relationship between PTSD and self-injurious behavior. Findings are consistent with research indicating that sleep disturbances, specifically nightmares, are important predictors of poor outcomes among those with PTSD, and extend this research to suggest their role in self-injurious behaviors as well.

1308,Suicidality in the juvenile justice environment,"This article provides an overview of the prevalence, risk factors, and screening instruments for suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviors in the juvenile delinquent population. Factors specific to the juvenile justice environment and their interactions with suicidality in adolescents are examined. Methods: A search of the MEDLINE and SearchMedica Psychiatry databases was conducted for articles published since 1980 in the areas of suicide and suicidal behavior in the juvenile offender population as well as the general adolescent population. Results: Several studies reported an increased rate of suicide and suicidal behavior in juvenile delinquents as compared to the general adolescent population. Risk factors can be grouped in four major categories-Demographic factors-female gender, race (Native American >Hispanic>White>Black); Psychiatric illness-mood disorders, substance abuse, conduct disorder, history of suicidal behavior; Psychological factors-impulsivity, history of sexual abuse; Environmental factors-housing with adults, room confinement, locked sleeping rooms, short term facility. Conclusion: The environment (juvenile detention) is but one of several factors that might explain the increased rate of suicides in juvenile facilities. A continuum of universal screening at intake, adequate psychiatric treatment including medication management and therapy, appropriate facility level changes, adequate housing, staff training and restricted use of confinement are likely to be very helpful.

1310,Relationship between traumatic brain injury history and recent suicidal ideation in Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans,"This study evaluated whether a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) was associated with increased risk for recent suicidal ideation (SI) after accounting for demographics, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep quality. In terms of increased risk, we hypothesized that a history of lifetime TBI would be associated with increased recent SI when compared with no history of TBI; multiple injuries were also evaluated. The sample included Iraq and Afghanistan war-era veterans (n = 838) who served in the United States military since 9/2001 and completed a structured TBI interview. Approximately 50% reported a lifetime history of at least 1 TBI, and 17.9% met criteria for current major depressive disorder (MDD). SI over the past week per the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation was the primary outcome. Demographics, current MDD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) per Structured Clinical Interview of DSMâ€“IV Axis I Disorders, sleep quality per Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and TBI history per structured interview were included in all statistical models. Current depression and poor sleep quality were consistently associated with recent SI. A history of any TBI history across the life span was not associated with increased recent SI (OR = 1.35, 95% CI [0.83, 2.19]). However, a history of multiple TBIs compared with no history of TBI was associated with increased recent SI (OR = 1.76, 95% CI [1.01, 3.06]). Results support the assertion than an accumulation of injuries amplifies risk. Severity of injury and deployment injuries were not significant factors. Among those with a history of 1 TBI, sleep, and depression, which may also be injury sequelae, may be salient treatment targets.

1312,Preliminary investigation of lithium for mood disorder symptoms in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,"Objective: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, than the general child population. Although children with ASD may experience irritability (aggression, self-injury, and tantrums), a portion also experience symptoms that are typical of a mood disorder, such as euphoria/elevated mood, mania, hypersexuality, paranoia, or decreased need for sleep. Despite lithium's established efficacy in controlling mood disorder symptoms in the neurotypical population, lithium has been rarely studied in children with ASD. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 30 children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria who were prescribed lithium in order to assess target symptoms, safety, and tolerability. Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) ratings were performed by two board-certified child psychiatrists with expertise in ASD. CGI-I scores were dichotomized into improved"" (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) or ""not improved"" (CGI-I score â‰¥3). Results: Forty-three percent of patients who received lithium were rated as ""improved"" on the CGI-I. Seventy-one percent of patients who had two or more pretreatment mood disorder symptoms were rated as ""improved."" The presence of mania (p = 0.033) or euphoria/elevated mood (p = 0.041) were the pretreatment symptoms significantly associated with an ""improved"" rating. The mean lithium blood level was 0.70mEq/L (SD = 0.26) and the average length of lithium treatment was 29.7 days (SD = 23.9). Forty-seven percent of patients were reported to have at least one side effect most commonly vomiting (13%) tremor (10%) fatigue (10%) irritability (7%) and enuresis (7%). Conclusions: This preliminary assessment of lithium in children and adolescents with ASD suggests that lithium may be a medication of interest for those who exhibit two or more mood disorder symptoms particularly mania or euphoria/elevated mood. A relatively high side effect rate merits caution and these results are limited by the retrospective uncontrolled study design. Future study of lithium in a prospective trial with treatment-sensitive outcome measures may be indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA all rights reserved).

1313,The Appropriate Use of Opioids in the Treatment of Refractory Restless Legs Syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distinct disorder, differing from chronic pain in many ways. Refractory RLS is characterized by unresponsiveness to dopamine agonists or alpha-2-delta ligands due to inadequate efficacy, augmentation, or adverse effects. This may result in severely impaired quality of life, profound insomnia, and suicidal depression. Opioid therapy is a mainstay in the management of these patients. This article summarizes the basic science and clinical evidence in support of their use, including the positive result of a large controlled multicenter study of 306 subjects, and outlines an approach to their use in clinical practice. Treatable explanations for RLS refractoriness, such as low iron stores, and other therapeutic options, such as combination therapy, should be considered before prescribing opioids. The agents most commonly used are oxycodone and methadone, but tramadol, codeine, morphine, and hydrocodone can also be considered. Controlled-release medication should be used for evening dosage and short-acting drugs, if needed, during the day. Effective doses are considerably lower than used for chronic pain (oxycodone 10-30 mg daily; methadone 5-20 mg daily) and the risk of opioid use disorder is relatively low. However, sensible precautions should be undertaken, including assessing opioid risk with standard questionnaires, using an opioid contract, using urine drug screens, consulting state prescription drug monitoring programs, and frequent reevaluation of effectiveness and side effects. Opioid use in selected patients with refractory RLS may be life-transforming with favorable risk-benefit ratio.; Copyright Â© 2017 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

1314,Evidence for the propositions of the interpersonal theory of suicide among a military sample,"Objective: Although the interpersonal theory of suicide may explain the elevated suicide risk among military service members, past explorations have been equivocal. This study aimed to investigate the propositions of the interpersonal theory in a sample of U.S. Army recruiters. Method: Participants (N = 3,428) completed self-report measures assessing the interpersonal theoryâ€™s constructs (i.e., thwarted belongingness (TB), perceived burdensomeness (PB), acquired capability for suicide), current suicidal ideation, agitation, and insomnia. History of depression was obtained from medical records. Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the interaction between TB and PB was associated with current suicidal ideation, controlling for depression, agitation, and insomnia. This effect was especially notable among those with high capability for suicide. Conclusion: Findings provide support for the interpersonal theory in a large, diverse military sample. It may be advantageous to assess and therapeutically address TB and PB among at-risk service members.

1315,A review of acute treatments for bipolar depression,"Bipolar patients generally spend much more time in the depressed phase of their illness than the manic phase, and there are many more bipolar type II and bipolar spectrum disorder patients than there are bipolar type I. Additionally, there is a significant risk of suicide in bipolar patients when depressed. The treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder is therefore a matter of some priority. Here, we review current evidence supporting the use of five groups of treatments: anti-depressants; lithium; anti-convulsants (valproate, and carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin); anti-psychotics; and other treatments (electroconvulsive therapy, benzodiazepines, sleep-deprivation, and dopamine agonists). From this review, it is apparent that the literature regarding the treatment of bipolar depression is significantly limited in several key areas. Nonetheless, from the evidence currently available, the treatments with the best evidence for efficacy are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and lamotrigine. There is also some evidence in favour of bupropion and moclobemide. Although lithium and olanzapine monotherapies can also be beneficial, they appear less efficacious than antidepressants. One of the major concerns about treatment with antidepressants has been the risk of precipitating a switch into mania. However, recent studies suggest that, if a mood stabilizer and antidepressant are given concurrently, then the risk of switching is minimized. There is also recent evidence for an independent antidepressant action for at least one atypical antipsychotic. Therefore, the conclusion from this review, in contrast to previous suggestions, is that a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and either an SSRI or lamotrigine may provide a useful first-line treatment for depressed bipolar disorder patients. Further research is clearly required to examine this approach and compare it with other possible treatment options.;Bipolar Disorder/*therapy, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use, Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy, Dopamine Agonists/therapeutic use, Electroconvulsive Therapy, Humans, Lithium Compounds/therapeutic use, Sleep Deprivation","Silverstone, Peter H & Silverstone, Trevor",0,1315
1316,"Longitudinal study of bad dreams in preschool-aged children: prevalence, demographic correlates, risk and protective factors","Study Objectives: To (1) clarify the epidemiology of bad dreams in children and investigate risk and protective factors related to (2) the child's sleep, (3) parental sleep-enabling practices, and (4) the child's temperament.; Design: Longitudinal with 6 time points from 5 months to 6 years.; Setting: Subjects' homes.; Participants: Representative sample of 987 children in the Province of Quebec.; Interventions: None.; Measurements and Results: Longitudinal logistic regression analysis models with primary endpoints of presence or absence of parent-rated bad dreams at 29 months, 41 months, 50 months, 5 years, and 6 years and predictor variables of demographic characteristics, parent ratings of child's sleep characteristics, parental sleep-enabling practices (e.g., cosleeping), and child's psychological characteristics at 5 and 17 months (anxiousness, temperament). Mothers' ratings indicated lower than expected prevalence of frequent bad dreams (1.3% to 3.9%). Demographic correlates of bad dreams were high family income, absence of siblings at 29 months, and a non-immigrant mother. The best predictor at 41 and 50 months was the presence of bad dreams the preceding year, whereas at 5 and 6 years, it was their earlier presence at 29 months. Early protective factors were parental practices favoring emotional nurturance after night awakenings (29 and 41 months); early risk factors were sleep-onset emotional nurturance (29 months), difficult temperament (5 months), and anxiousness (17 months).; Conclusions: Bad dreams in preschoolers are less prevalent than thought but, when present, are trait-like in nature and associated with personality characteristics measured as early as 5 months.

1317,Depressive disorders in children and adolescents,"Depressive disorders in children and adolescents are valid clinical entities which can be identified using adult diagnostic criteria. Recent research has resulted in significant progress in the areas of diagnosis, epidemiology, family pathology, pharmacokinetics and psychopharmacology. Many rating instruments have been developed to screen, diagnose and measure changes of depression in children and adolescents. The prevalence of depressive disorders in prepubertal children is about 2% and in adolescents about 5%. Depressive episodes are usually of long duration, with high rates of relapse. These relapses are usually associated with school, family and social failure. Follow-up studies of depressed adolescents indicated that about half of the patients continue to suffer from mood disturbances and psycho-social adaptational problems. In North America suicidal behaviour in adolescents has increased 300% in the past 30 years. However, its relationship to depression is more complex than in adults. There is a significant excess of affective illness and alcoholism in the families of depressed adolescents. Similarly, there is a high rate of impairment among children of parents with affective disorders. During depressive episodes, prepubertal children show abnormalities of growth hormone and cortisol secretion. However, DST findings are contradictory. Polysomnographic findings in childhood depression appear unremarkable. In adolescent depression these findings are similar to those in depressed adults. Biological manifestations of depressive disorders may be significantly affected by developmental and hormonal changes. Antidepressants have been effective in the therapy of several disorders in childhood. These include enuresis, school phobias, attention deficit, conduct disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Open drug studies suggest that antidepressants are useful in depressed children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Adolescent, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Child, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Factors","Simeon, J G",0,1317
1318,Psychiatrists awake! Suicide risk assessments are all about a good night's sleep,"Discusses the importance of providing a reasonable standard or care in assessing patient suicide risk. Generally, psychiatrists are only found liable for a patient's suicide when they have failed to assess the patient's risk of suicide adequately, failed to manage the suicidal patient appropriately, and failed to implement an appropriate treatment plan. It is suggested that clinical risk management provides a reasonable perspective on the treatment of the patient at suicidal risk, combining professional expertise and knowledge of the patient with a working understanding of the legal issues governing psychiatric practice. Risk-benefit analysis is described as an example of a clinical risk management technique. The unique circumstances associated with service provision in managed care settings are discussed. In these settings, the heightened risk of patient suicide arises from premature discharge. Treatment guidelines are presented that may help preempt a lawsuit in cases where a patient commits suicide.

1319,Subjective and objective sleep and self-harm behaviors in young children: A general population study,"Significant association between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation and/or attempts is reported in adults and adolescents. However, there is paucity of studies exploring the association between sleep and self-harm behaviors (SHB) in young children and are limited to only subjective sleep measures. We examined the association between SHB and both subjective and objective sleep in a population-based sample of 5-12 yr old. Parents of every student in 3 local school (K-5) districts (n = 7312) was sent a screening questionnaire. Randomly selected children from this sample underwent a comprehensive history, physical examination, a 9-h overnight polysomnogram and completed several questionnaires. Among the final sample (n = 693), 27 children had SHB with adjusted prevalence of 3%. There was no difference in age, gender, obesity, or socioeconomic status in subjects with or without SHB. Significantly more children with SHB had subjective sleep difficulty and depression. Difficulty maintaining sleep and frequent nightmares were associated with SHB independent of depression or demographics. Polysomnographic %REM-sleep was significantly higher in the SHB group after adjusting for demographics and depression. These data indicate that parent reported sleep disturbances are independently associated with SHB. It is possible that higher REM-sleep is a non-invasive biomarker for risk of self-harm behaviors in young children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

1320,Skin picking and sleep disturbances: relationship to anxiety and need for research,"Pathological excoriation (PE) or skin picking is seen in nearly 2% of patients attending dermatology clinics and is often associated with anxiety, stress and frequent help-seeking behaviors. While anxiety and stress are thought to cause poor sleep in the general population, not all anxious people, even those with disabling anxiety disorders, necessarily suffer from insomnia or other sleep problems. The relationship between anxiety symptoms and poor sleep, therefore, remains unclear and sleep quality in PE is unknown. We examined the sleep quality and levels of anxiety in dermatological patients with PE. Dermatological patients with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) PE and healthy controls (n = 10) were assessed on standardized and validated measures of subjective sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)], anxiety (Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory; modified Zung Anxiety Scale), stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and work and social disability [Sheehan Disability Inventory subscale (SDI-4)]. Patients with dermatological complaints as a group reported poorer sleep quality, higher scores on Spielberger State and Zung anxiety, perceived stress, and SDI-4. Among both groups of dermatological patients, only the PE group had significantly poor sleep, high anxiety, and perceived stress compared to healthy controls. In the dermatological patients with PE, PSQI-global scores were significantly positively correlated to Spielberger State and Zung Anxiety scores. Dermatological patients with PE are more anxious and have poorer subjective sleep compared to dermatological patients without PE and healthy. Future research is needed to elucidate these relationship factors and to develop new behavioral and drug treatments for the management of PE.; Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.Anxiety Disorders/*psychology, Self-Injurious Behavior/*psychology, Skin/*injuries, Sleep Wake Disorders/*psychology, Adult, Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis, Attitude to Health, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Personality Inventory, Self-Injurious Behavior/diagnosis, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology, Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis, Stress, Psychological/complications","Singareddy, Ravi; Moin, Ali; Spurlock, Lisa; Merritt-Davis, Orlena & Uhde, Thomas W",0,1320

The data were collected from 1,500 Indian school students enrolled in sixth to eleventh grades drawn from rural, urban, and metro settings. They completed an anonymous Adolescent Lifestyle Survey. The study documents the multiple concerns related to inappropriate dietary practices (fast food consumption, cold drinks, low fruit and vegetable intake), irregular sleeping habits, less religiosity, mild activity pattern, unhealthy daily routine and pursuance of different forms of risk behaviours. The study also showed an association of life style with several contextual variables (i.e., residential context, developmental stage and gender). The results suggest need for urgent attention to deal with the emerging concerns of risks and promoting factors of health through relevant policy-oriented reformulation, coordinated efforts among stakeholders, and initiating culturally appropriate lifestyle interventions among adolescents.

1322,"Suicidal ideation in depressed postpartum women: Associations with childhood trauma, sleep disturbance and anxiety","Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in postpartum women. Identifying modifiable factors related to suicide risk in mothers after delivery is a public health priority. Our study aim was to examine associations between suicidal ideation (SI) and plausible risk factors (experience of abuse in childhood or as an adult, sleep disturbance, and anxiety symptoms) in depressed postpartum women. Methods: This secondary analysis included 628 depressed mothers at 4-6 weeks postpartum. Diagnosis was confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. We examined SI from responses to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-EPDS item 10; depression levels on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Atypical Depression Symptoms (SIGH-ADS); plus sleep disturbance and anxiety levels with subscales from the EPDS and SIGH-ADS items on sleep and anxiety symptoms. Results: Of the depressed mothers, 496 (79%) â€˜neverâ€™ had thoughts of self-harm; 98 (15.6%) â€˜hardly everâ€™; and 34 (5.4%) â€˜sometimesâ€™ or â€˜quite oftenâ€™. Logistic regression models indicated that having frequent thoughts of self-harm was related to childhood physical abuse (odds ratio-OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00, 2.81); in mothers without childhood physical abuse, having frequent self-harm thoughts was related to sleep disturbance (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.29) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.23). Discussion: Because women with postpartum depression can present with frequent thoughts of self-harm and a high level of clinical complexity, conducting a detailed safety assessment, that includes evaluation of childhood abuse history and current symptoms of sleep disturbance and anxiety, is a key component in the management of depressed mothers.

1323,Persistent nightmares are associated with repeat suicide attempt: A prospective study,"The aim of this prospective study was to determine if sleep disturbances and nightmares are associated with increased risk of repeat suicide attempt. Patients (n = 165) aged 18-68 years who were admitted to medical or psychiatric wards after a suicide attempt completed an initial interview; 98 of these took part in a 2-month follow-up interview. The Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and two self-report instruments, the Uppsala Sleep Inventory and the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) Self-Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes, were administered both at baseline and follow-up. Data concerning repeat suicide attempts within 2 years were obtained from hospital records. Analyses were performed using Student's t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression. In total 42 patients (26%) made at least one repeat suicide attempt within 2 years. While neither difficulties initiating/maintaining sleep nor early morning awakening at baseline predicted repeat attempt, having frequent nightmares did (OR = 3.15). The risk was further heightened when nightmares were reported at both baseline and 2-month follow-up (OR = 5.20). These associations remained after adjusting for sex, axis-I DSM-IV diagnoses, and self-reported depression and anxiety symptom intensity. Our findings suggest that nightmares might constitute a marker for increased risk of suicidal behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1324,Nightmares and sleep disturbances in relation to suicidality in suicide attempters,"Study Objectives: To study the prevalence of specific sleep disturbances in suicide attempters and to examine the association between specific sleep disturbances and suicidality. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional study in suicide attempters during the period October 1, 2001, to June 30, 2004. Participants: One hundred sixty-five patients aged 18 to 68 years who were admitted to medical units or psychiatric wards at Sahlgrenska University Hospital after a suicide attempt. Interventions: N/A Measurements: The face-to-face interview included Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-IV and the Suicide Assessment Scale. Two self-report instruments were employed, the Uppsala Sleep Inventory and Comprehensive Psychopathological Self-rating Scale for Affective Syndromes. The latter assessed symptom burden. Using multiple logistic regression analyses, we examined associations between sleep complaints and suicidality. Results: Eighty-nine percent of subjects reported some kind of sleep disturbance. The most common complaint was difficulties initiating sleep (73%). Other complaints included difficulties maintaining sleep (69%), nightmares (66%) and early morning awakening (58%). Nightmares were associated with a 5-fold increase in risk for high suicidality. This relationship remained after adjustment for psychiatric diagnosis and psychiatric symptom intensity. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are common among suicide attempters. Nightmares are associated with suicidality. Our findings suggest that questions concerning sleep disturbance and nightmares should be addressed in the clinical assessment of suicidal patients.

1325,The treatment of bipolar patients with elevated impulsivity and suicide risk,"Presents a case report of 22-year-old man with bipolar II disorder, who was referred for follow-up at the mood disorders clinic of a tertiary care center. He was first seen by a psychiatrist at age 20 when he had a 6-week episode of decreased need for sleep; increased energy; difficulty concentrating; and impulsive spending, including purchasing a new house. This patient's case highlights the potential high lethality of suicidal ideation and planning in individuals with bipolar II disorder and elevated impulsivity. Several studies have reported that patients with bipolar disorder score higher on impulsivity measures than healthy controls. Elevated impulsivity may increase the risk of suicidality in patients with bipolar disorder. Although there are limited data on the treatment of highly impulsive patients, there is evidence that lithium may reduce both impulsivity and suicidality in patients with bipolar disorder. Clinicians treating patients with bipolar disorder should be vigilant during assessment and followup for elevated impulsivity as part of a thorough suicide risk assessment and should consider lithium maintenance as a potential strategy.

Methods: Cognitive assessments, questionnaires and semiâ€structured interviews were used to gather data on intellectual disability, verbal and physical aggression, destructive behaviour and selfâ€injury and on characteristics known to be associated with aggression. Results: Aggression in SMS was more prevalent (87%), but not more severe than aggression in contrast groups. Aggressive behaviour was more frequently associated with environmental contingencies (e.g. attention, escape and access to tangibles) than selfâ€injury and destructive behaviours. Severity of challenging behaviours was associated with high impulsivity. Conclusion: Aggression is seen in the majority of people with SMS. Results suggest that behavioural disinhibition and operant social reinforcement are associated with the manifestation of aggression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1327,Antidepressant response trajectories and associated clinical prognostic factors among older adults,"Importance: More than 50% of older adults with late-life major depressive disorder fail to respond to initial treatment with first-line pharmacological therapy. Objectives: To assess typical patterns of response to an open-label trial of extended-release venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine XR) for late-life depression and to evaluate which clinical factors are associated with the identified longitudinal response patterns. Design, Setting, and Participants: Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to data from a 12-week open-label pharmacological trial conducted in specialty care as part of the Incomplete Response in Late Life: Getting to Remission Study. Clinical prognostic factors, including domain-specific cognitive performance and individual depression symptoms, were examined in relation to response trajectories. Participants included 453 adults aged 60 years or older with current major depressive disorder. The study was conducted between August 2009 and August 2014. Intervention: Open-label venlafaxine XR (titrated up to 300 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Subgroups exhibiting similar response patterns were derived from repeated measures of overall depression severity obtained using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Results: Among the 453 study participants, 3 subgroups with differing baseline depression severity clearly responded to treatment: one group with the lowest baseline severity had a rapid response (n = 69 [15.23%]), and distinct responses were also apparent among groups starting at moderate (n = 108 [23.84%]) and higher (n = 25 [5.52%]) baseline symptom levels. Three subgroups had nonresponding trajectories: 2 with high baseline symptom levels (totaling 35.98%: high, nonresponse 1, n = 110 [24.28%]; high, nonresponse 2, n = 53 [11.70%]) and 1 with moderate baseline symptom levels (n = 88 [19.43%]). Several factors were independently associated with having a nonresponsive trajectory, including greater baseline depression severity, longer episode duration, less subjective sleep loss, more guilt, and more work/activity impairment (P < .05). Higher delayed memory (list recognition) performance was independently associated with having a rapid response (adjusted odds ratio = 2.22; 95%CI, 1.18-4.20). Conclusions and Relevance: Based on the observed trajectory patterns, patients who have late-life depression with high baseline depression severity are unlikely to respond after 12 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine XR. However, high baseline depression severity alone may be neither a necessary nor sufficient predictor of treatment nonresponse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

1329,Dependence on the Brazilian diet pill: A case report,"Presents a case report of a 29-year-old woman, originally from Mexico, living in a domestic violence shelter with an extensive history of emotional and physical trauma, presented with feelings of hopelessness, inability to sleep, and dependence on diet pills. She had a longstanding history of depressive symptoms and paranoia complicated by threatening auditory and visual hallucinations. One month prior to presentation, she took an unknown amount of acetaminophen and ibuprofen and superficially cut her wrist in a suicidal gesture. The patientâ€™s hallucinations were thought to be related to either a primary psychotic disorder, flashbacks due to posttraumatic stress disorder, or psychotic depression. She subsequently showed improvement in her symptoms on a regimen of fluoxetine and aripiprazole. Three months later, she was able to successfully discontinue diet pill use. With the increasing use of nonprescription diet pills in the United States, this case highlights the importance of incorporating screening for their use into evaluations by primary care providers, psychiatrists, and addiction specialists. These products may cause dependence, exacerbate existing psychiatric symptoms, and complicate the management of psychiatric disorders. When appropriate, clinicians should consider analyzing weight loss pills for undeclared compounds, especially if the patient demonstrates dependence or experiences otherwise unexplained symptoms.

The primary purpose of the present investigation was to study the safety and toxicity of higher doses of amantadine in subjects who previously failed or were intolerant to interferon. The secondary aim was to test the efficacy of higher dose of amantadine against hepatitis C.; Methods: An open-labeled prospective study was conducted starting with amantadine 200 mg daily and increasing to 500 mg daily while monitoring for safety, toxicity, and efficacy. An amantadine blood level exceeding 1,600 ng/ml was considered toxic requiring dose reduction. The patient's symptoms, laboratory tests, and quality of life were monitored.; Results: One hundred patients enrolled in the study. Normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for each dose was as follows: 200 mg (35%), 300 mg (49%), 400 mg (53%), and 500 mg (56%). The incidence of toxic amantadine plasma levels increased with dose, i.e., 200 mg (0%), 300 mg (6%), 400 mg (27%), and 500 mg (49%). The frequency and severity of arthralgias and fatigue improved at all dosages administered. No changes in the occurrence or severity of headache, insomnia, or depression were reported. Serious adverse events included myocardial infarction and suicide attempt. Other side effects included impotence, confusion, alopecia, and hoarseness.; Conclusions: Amantadine given at a dose of 300 mg daily is safe, and significantly lowers ALT blood levels more than 200 mg daily.

Some of the symptoms of depression include depressed mood, significant change in weight or appetite, changes in sleep patterns, a decrease in concentration and energy, and possible suicide. However, depression is a treatable illness, especially with the newer class of antidepressant agents, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). One side effect of SSRI use includes hyponatremia, which is becoming an increasingly serious complication that may have harmful clinical ramifications.

1332,The Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health): Applying Implementation Science Frameworks to the Process of Adapting an Evidence-Based Parenting Program for Prevention of Pediatric Obesity and Excess Weight Gain in Primary Care,"Implementation experts have recently argued for a process of scaling out"" evidence-based interventions programs and practices (EBPs) to improve reach to new populations and new service delivery systems. A process of planned adaptation is typically required to integrate EBPs into new service delivery systems and address the needs of targeted populations while simultaneously maintaining fidelity to core components. This process-oriented paper describes the application of an implementation science framework and coding system to the adaptation of the Family Check-Up (FCU) for a new clinical target and service delivery system-prevention of obesity and excess weight game in primary care. The original FCU has demonstrated both short- and long-term effects on obesity with underserved families across a wide age range. The advantage of adapting such a program is the existing empirical evidence that the intervention improves the primary mediator of effects on the new target outcome. We offer a guide for determining the levels of evidence to undertake the adaptation of an existing EBP for a new clinical target. In this paper adaptation included shifting the frame of the intervention from one of risk reduction to health promotion; adding health-specific assessments in the areas of nutrition physical activity sleep and media parenting behaviors; family interaction tasks related to goals for health and health behaviors; and coordinating with community resources for physical health. We discuss the multi-year process of adaptation that began by engaging the FCU developer community stakeholders and families which was then followed by a pilot feasibility study and continues in an ongoing randomized effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. The adapted program is called the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health). We apply a comprehensive coding system for the adaptation of EBPs to our process and also provide a side-by-side comparison of behavior change techniques for obesity prevention and management used in the original FCU and in the FCU4Health. These provide a rigorous means of classification as well as a common language that can be used when adapting other EBPs for context content population or clinical target.

1333,"The nexus of sleep psychology, psychiatry, and neurology in health","This edition highlights a variety, but by no means exhaustive range of common sleep disorders that often require targeted, specialized treatment, even when they occur within the context of contributing medical and psychiatric disorders. It also emphasizes the broad mental and physical health implications of deficient sleep that may not rise to the level of a specific sleep disorder, but which should be attended to by healthcare professionals with the same import as facilitating tobacco cessation or decreasing problem drinking behaviour. Clinicians treating patients with chronic medical and psychiatric disease need to flexibly and sometimes simultaneously conceptualize sleep as a behaviour, a disorder, and a symptom of another disorder. As a symptom, emergent sleep disruption is often prodromal, signalling pending relapse of major depression or the onset of mania. Severe insomnia can also be a marker of disease severity, heightening risk for suicidal behaviour. Insomnia too can be evidence of partial remission, predisposing to future relapse if untreated. Conceptualizing and intervening on these dimensions of sleep in the clinical context can be challenging, but has great potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes.

1334,Suicidal Ideation in Outpatients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: An Exploratory Study of the Role of Sleep Onset Insomnia and Pain Intensity,"Objectives: Sleep disturbance, depression, and heightened risk of suicide are among the most clinically significant sequelae of chronic pain. While sleep disturbance is associated with suicidality in patients with major depression and is a significant independent predictor of completed suicide in psychiatric patients, it is not known whether sleep disturbance is associated with suicidal behavior in chronic pain. This exploratory study evaluates the importance of insomnia in discriminating suicidal ideation in chronic pain relative to depression severity and other pain-related factors. Methods: Fifty-one outpatients with non-cancer chronic pain were recruited. Subjects completed a pain and sleep survey, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Multidimensional Pain Inventory. Subjects were classified as suicidal ideators"" or ""non-ideators"" based on their responses to BDI-Item 9 (Suicide). Bivariate analyses and multivariate discriminant function analyses were conducted. Results: Twenty-four percent reported suicidal ideation (without intent). Suicidal ideators endorsed higher levels of: sleep onset insomnia pain intensity medication usage pain-related interference affective distress and depressive symptoms (P < 0.03). These 6 variables were entered into stepwise discriminant function analyses. Two variables predicted group membership: Sleep Onset Insomnia Severity and Pain Intensity respectively. The discriminant function correctly classified 84.3% of the cases (P < 0.0001). Discussion: Chronic pain patients who self-reported severe and frequent initial insomnia with concomitant daytime dysfunction and high pain intensity were more likely to report passive suicidal ideation independent from the effects of depression severity. Future research aimed at determining whether sleep disturbance is a modifiable risk factor for suicidal ideation in chronic pain is warranted.

1335,Is extended clonazepam cotherapy of fluoxetine effective for outpatients with major depression?,"Clonazepam cotherapy of fluoxetine was previously demonstrated to accelerate efficacy over the first 3 wks of treatment. A new 18-wk double-blind study attempted to replicate these findings to determine whether superiority would extend to 3 mo and assess risks of extension. 50 outpatient volunteers (aged 18-65 yrs) with moderate-marked depression received fluoxetine (20 mg) doubled at 6 wks if needed; half took clonazepam (0.5 mg) and half took an identical placebo, 1 or 2 tablets adjusted during the 1st 2 wks, until a 3-wk taper at 3 mo. No serious adverse events and no special problems with sedation or discontinuation were noted. Cotherapy was superior to fluoxetine monotherapy at Day 7 for Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) but not otherwise. Cotherapy was effective in reducing insomnia but not anxiety or core symptoms (low mood, suicidality, reduced interest). The only significant benefit of extending treatment was a more rapid response to increased fluoxetine at 6 wks manifested in a mean HAM-D of 9.0 and CGI-I responder rate of 76% after 8 wks compared to 16 wks for monotherapy. The small sample size limited power and rendered conclusions tentative.

1336,Mortality in a cohort of chronically fatigued patients,"Background: Comprehensive studies of mortality among patients with chronic fatigue (CF) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have not been published, but several sources suggest that CFS is associated with an elevated risk for suicide.; Method: Data on 1201 chronically fatigued patients followed in a university-affiliated tertiary-care clinic for up to 14 years were submitted to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Death Index (NDI) to evaluate all-cause and suicide-caused death rates against standardized mortality rates (SMRs). We used Life Table Analysis to examine the influence of sex and diagnoses of CFS and depression.; Results: All-cause mortality in chronically fatigued patients was no higher than expected, but suicide-caused death rates were more than eight times higher than in the US general population. The significant elevation in the SMR of suicide was restricted to those who did not meet criteria for CFS [SMR(CF)=14.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-29.3 versus SMR(CFS)=3.6, 95% CI 0.4-12.9]. Among chronically fatigued patients who did not meet CFS criteria, those with a lifetime history of major depression (MD) had higher suicide-caused death rates than among their non-depressed counterparts (SMR(MD)=19.1, 95% CI 7.0-41.5 versus SMR(NMD)=5.6, 95% CI 0.1-31.4), although the difference was not significant.; Conclusions: CFS does not appear to be associated with increased all-cause mortality or suicide rates.

1337,"The Relationship between Suicidal Responses and Traumatic Brain Injury and Severe Insomnia in Active Duty, Veteran, and Civilian Populations","This study examined how a positive traumatic brain injury (TBI) screening and insomnia severity relate to suicidal outcomes across active duty, veteran, and civilian samples. Data were used from 3,993 participants from 19 studies. We conducted a series of analyses by group to identify which significantly differed on the variables of interest. TBI and insomnia each had independent relationships with outcomes over and above the impact of the other factor. Veterans presented as clinically worse across the outcomes. However, the relationship between insomnia and suicidal responses was stronger for active duty military compared to veterans. Continued research on TBIs and insomnia severity across groups will improve quality of care for those at risk of suicide.; insomnia, military, suicide, traumatic brain injury, veteran","Soberay, Kelly A.; Hanson, Jetta E.; Dwyer, Megan; Plant, E.

1338,Self-injurious behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder enrolled in the Study to Explore Early Development,"We assessed potential factors associated with current"" or ""ever"" self-injurious behaviors reported in the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised among children with autism spectrum disorder (nâ€‰=â€‰692) from the Study to Explore Early Development. Data on factors examined were obtained from questionnaires standardized clinical instruments and birth certificates. We employed a log-binomial regression to assess these associations. Although most associations were quite similar for currently and ever exhibiting self-injurious behaviors a few differences were noted. We documented previously unreported associations of current self-injurious behaviors with maternal age and cesarean delivery and ever self-injurious behaviors with maternal age child sex gestational age and maternal race. We also confirmed previously reported associations with adaptive skills somatic conditions (sleep gastrointestinal and sensory abnormalities) and other behavioral problems. These findings are informative for clinical practice and future research.; ""autism, autism spectrum disorder, challenging behaviors, developmental disabilities, self-injurious behaviors","Soke, Gnakub Norbert; Rosenberg, Steven A.; Rosenberg, Cordelia Robinson; Vasa, Roma A.; Lee, Li-Ching & DiGuiseppi, Carolyn",1,1338
1339,Sleep quality is associated with vasopressin methylation in pregnant and postpartum women with a history of psychosocial stress,"The relationship between disturbed sleep and stress is well-documented. Sleep disorders and stress are highly prevalent during the perinatal period, and both are known to contribute to a number of adverse maternal and foetal outcomes. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a hormone and a neuropeptide that is involved in stress response, social bonding and circadian regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Whether the AVP system is involved in regulation of stress response and sleep quality in the context of the perinatal mental health is currently unknown. The objective of the present study was to assess the relationship between levels of cumulative and ongoing psychosocial risk, levels of disordered sleep and AVP methylation in a community sample of pregnant and postpartum women.Methods: A sample of 316 participants completed a battery of questionnaires during the second trimester of pregnancy (PN2, 12-14 weeks gestation), third trimester (PN3, 32-34 weeks gestation), and at 7-9 weeks postpartum (PP). Disordered sleep was measured using the Sleep Symptom Checklist at PN2, PN3 and PP; cumulative psychosocial risk was assessed with the Antenatal Risk Questionnaire (ANRQ) at PN2; salivary D was collected at the follow-up (FU, 2.9 years postpartum); and % methylation were calculated for AVP and for two of the three AVP receptor genes (AVPR1a and AVPR1b). Women were separated into high (HighPR) and low (LowPR) psychosocial risk groups, based on their scores on the ANRQ.Results: Women in the HighPR group had significantly worse sleep disturbances during PN2 (p < .001) and PN3 (p < .001), but not at PP (p = .146) than women in the LowPR group. In HighPR participants only, methylation of AVP at intron 1 negatively correlated with sleep disturbances at PN2 (rs=-.390, p = .001), PN3 (rs=-.384, p = .002) and at PP (rs= -.269, p = .032). There was no association between sleep disturbances and AVPR1a or AVPR1b methylation, or between sleep disturbances and any of the AVP methylation for the LowPR group. Lastly, cumulative psychosocial stress was a moderator for the relationship between AVP intron 1 methylation and disordered sleep at PN2 (p < .001, adjusted R2 = .105), PN2 (p < .001, adjusted R2 = .088) and PP (p = .003, adjusted R2 = .064).Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative psychosocial stress exacerbates sleep disorders in pregnant women, and that salivary D methylation patterns of the AVP gene may be seen as a marker of biological predisposition to stress and sleep reactivity during the perinatal period. Further research is needed to establish causal links between AVP methylation, sleep and stress","Solomonova E; Lee YEA; Robins S; King L; Feeley N; Gold I; Hayton B; Libman E; Nagy C; Turecki G; Zelkowitz P, ",1,1339
1340,"Neurocognitive Game between Risk Factors, Sleep and Suicidal Behaviour","Introduction: Sleep and lifestyles interact to allow the appropriate development of cerebral structures, and prevention of mood disorders. But just a hand of articles identified a precise relationship between these two above, and the probability to develop a suicidal behaviour.; Objective: The aim of this study is to explore how the suicidal behaviour is associated in simultaneous with sleep components, psychological stress, depression, anxiety, well-being, addiction, and global health of participants; and if it is also influenced by the sociodemographic profile of each subject.; Methods: The present study was led by a questionnaire incorporating McNair test, and an incorporated score to evaluate suicide tendencies. The questionnaire also included socio-demographic items and other questions to exhibit a profile of suicide tendency for each individual.; Results: Our results showed that the stress levels and well-being are comparable according to gender. Specifically the results showed that lack of sleep combined with a low score to McNair test strongly affects the suicidal tendency, while score of memory and attention decreased.; Conclusions: The suicidal behaviour is closely linked with sleep parameters which decreased accordingly, and the family's history of medication and suicidal behaviour.; mood disorders, sleep, sleep disorders, suicide, young adult","Sosso, Etindele & Armel, Faustin",1,1340
1341,Neuropsychiatric adverse events of bupropion treatment: A brief update,"The clinical use of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation has raised some concern in clinicians and public opinion. Clinical and post-marketing surveillance studies indicate a favourable side effect profile, but spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to medical authorities indicate adverse neuropsychiatric events to be more frequent than previously thought. Except for the risk of seizures, adverse neuropsychiatric events have not been examined systematically. Insomnia has been reported quite frequently. In the placebo-controlled trials, depression scores were unaffected by bupropion treatment. Suspected adverse events reported to medical authorities in the UK or Germany indicate depression to be the most common psychiatric disorder associated with bupropion treatment. Switch to mania or hypomania is very rare, as are psychosis or organic mental disorders. Suicide attempts associated with bupropion use have been reported as possible adverse events. This topic warrants further attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1342,Differentiating Single and Multiple Suicide Attempters: What Nightmares Can Tell Us That Other Predictors Cannot,"Study Objectives: Although nightmares have been associated with suicidal behavior beyond well-known risk factors, the association between nightmares and multiple suicide attempts remains largely unexplored. This study addressed this gap in the literature by examining whether nightmares differentiated between individuals who reported single versus multiple suicide attempts. The individual contributions of nightmare frequency, distress/severity, and chronicity were also investigated to determine which variable contributed the most variance.; Methods: Participants (n = 225) were recruited as part of a larger data collection through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing venue. Participants reported attempting suicide once (n = 107 individuals), multiple times (n = 118), or never (n = 791). Nightmare frequency, distress, and chronicity were assessed with the Disturbing Dreams and Nightmares Severity Index.; Results: Nightmare frequency differentiated multiple from single suicide attempters, even after controlling for symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, nightmare severity/distress, nightmare chronicity, and age (P = .019). Comparison participants, those not reporting suicide attempts, reported a significantly lower level of nightmare frequency than those reporting single or multiple suicide attempts.; Conclusions: Inconsistent with past research, this study showed that nightmare frequency, and not nightmare chronicity or severity/distress, differentiated between single and multiple suicide attempters. This outcome suggests that the number of nightmares experienced may be more pertinent in predicting repeat suicide attempts than their duration or perceived severity. Study limitations include a cross-sectional design, a convenience sampling approach, a lack of control for previous treatment or length of time since last attempt, and a retrospective nightmare measure.; Â© 2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.PTSD, depression, insomnia, multiple suicide attempters, nightmare chronicity, nightmare frequency, nightmare severity, nightmares, psychopathology, sleep and psychiatric conditions","Speed, Katrina J.; Drapeau, Christopher W. & Nadorff, Michael R.",0,1342
1343,Post deployment care for returning combat veterans,"Since September 11, 2001, 2.4 million military personnel have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. To date, roughly 1.44 million have separated from the military and approximately 772,000 of these veterans have used VA health care. Combat deployments impact the physical, psychological, and social health of veterans. Given that many veterans are receiving care from non-VA providers, it is important that all community health care workers be familiar with the unique health care needs of this patient population, which include injuries associated with blast exposures (including mild traumatic brain injury), as well as a variety of mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Other important health concerns are chronic musculoskeletal pain, medically unexplained symptoms, sequelae of environmental exposures, depression, suicide, substance abuse, sleep disturbances, and impairments in family, occupational and social functioning. Elevated rates of hypertension and tobacco use remind us that deployment may result not only in immediate impacts on health, but also increase risk for chronic disease, contributing to a growing public health burden. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these health concerns and offers practical management guidelines for primary care providers. In light of relationships between physical, psychological and psychosocial concerns in this population, we recommend an interdisciplinary approach to care directed toward mitigating the long-term health impacts of combat.

1344,Doxepin: Misuse and abuse,"Presents a case report of a 55-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder type I of unknown duration, as well as alcohol and cocaine use disorder, continuous use, who was admitted to a VA medical ward for rhabdomyolysis felt to be related to his cocaine use. Past history was significant for over 100 psychiatric hospitalizations, 2 prior lethal suicide attempts, and HIV. His prescribed psychotropics included lithium 900 mg daily and doxepin 200 mg at bedtime. On the morning of admission, after inhaling an unknown amount of crack cocaine, he contemplated overdosing. Being concerned by these thoughts, the patient voluntarily presented to the emergency department (ED). In the ED, he endorsed visual hallucinations of seeing the world spinning in his head and felt he had an ability to predict the future. He also endorsed reduced sleep for the past 2 months despite stating his self-titrated increased doses of doxepin were helping him sleep. Initial interview was notable for racing and tangential thoughts, grandiosity, distractibility, sexual preoccupation, and delusions. On the fourth day of hospitalization, creatinine kinase trended down to 2050 U/L, and he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric ward for vague suicidal ideation. The patient was found to be positive for cocaine during these admissions as well. Despite the noted abuse potential of tertiary tricyclic antidepressants, the continued misuse of these medications is potentially a more common problem than is represented in literature on the topic.

1345,Seasonal affective disorder: report from India (latitude 26 degrees 45'N),"Background: A number of studies have established the entity of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and delineated the presence of atypical depressive features of carbohydrate craving, hyperphagia and hypersomnia. Most literature has emanated from research carried out in temperate climates, and only few reports are available from tropical countries, especially India.; Methods: Consecutive patients with recurrent mood disorder (who had at least 2 episodes of depression in the past) comprised the study sample. The diagnosis of mood disorder was made according to DSM-III-R criteria. The sample was divided into two groups - seasonal and non-seasonal according to the DSM-III-R criteria of seasonal pattern. The depressed patients were rated on SADD and HDRS, and manic patients on BRMRS.; Results: Eighteen of 93 patients fulfilled the criteria of seasonal pattern; 7 of these seasonal patients, and 25 of the non-seasonal patients were currently in depressive phase. Males dominated the sample in both the groups. The seasonal and non-seasonal groups as regards symptomatology, differed only on a few items - decreased libido on SADD, and suicidal ideation and helplessness on HDRS. Atypical vegetative features were not seen in any of the seasonal patients.; Conclusions: SAD is seen at lower latitudes also, although atypical vegetative features are not a prominent part of the symptomatology.; Limitations: The study sampled was obtained from a very select population, and thus does not indicate the prevalence of SAD in India. Secondly, the small sample size precludes any categorical comments of the symptomatology. Moreover, winter and summer depressives were considered as one group.; Clinical Relevance: Emphasising the presence of SAD in a tropical country where there is relatively less variation in daylight periods, this report forms a base for future studies. It also raises the question of the role of variations in daylight in the aetiology SAD.;Seasonal Affective Disorder/*epidemiology, Seasonal Affective Disorder/*psychology, Adult, Aged, Female, Geography, Humans, India/epidemiology, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Recurrence, Seasonal Affective Disorder/diagnosis, Severity of Illness Index","Srivastava, S & Sharma, M",1,1345
1346,Mindfulness-based touch therapy and mindfulness practice in persons with moderate depression,"The goal of the study was to explore the effects of mindfulness-based touch therapy, a passive body-therapy intervention, in combination with the practice of mindfulness as an active meditative discipline, in patients with moderate recurring or episodic depression. The method under study is seen as a possible adjunct to psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy. The degree of depression before and after the therapy phase was determined according to Hamiltonâ€™s scale. The outcome was a highly significant improvement in depressive illness, with a general alleviation of depressed mood, reduction in feelings of guilt, in suicidal thoughts and in sleep maintenance insomnia; increase in motivation in carrying out everyday activities; reduction in feelings of anxiety at both psychological and somatic levels and easing of general somatic symptoms. The results show that the method under study can serve persons suffering from depression as an adjunct to conventional therapeutic measures.

1347,Specific mood symptoms confer risk for subsequent suicidal ideation in bipolar disorder with and without suicide attempt history: Multiwave data from STEP-BD,"Background: Little is known about specific mood symptoms that may confer risk for suicidal ideation (SI) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). We evaluated prospectively whether particular symptoms of depression and mania precede the onset or worsening of SI, among adults with or without a history of a suicide attempt. Methods: We examined prospective data from a large (N = 2,741) cohort of patients participating in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEPâ€BD). We evaluated history of suicide attempts at baseline, and symptoms of depression and mania at baseline and followâ€up visits. Hierarchical linear modeling tested whether specific mood symptoms predicted subsequent levels of SI, and whether the strength of the associations differed based on suicide attempt history, after accounting for the influence of other mood symptoms and current SI. Results: Beyond overall current depression and mania symptom severity, baseline SI, and illness characteristics, several mood symptoms, including guilt, reduced selfâ€esteem, psychomotor retardation and agitation, increases in appetite, and distractibility predicted more severe levels of subsequent SI. Problems with concentration, distraction, sleep loss and decreased need for sleep predicted subsequent SI more strongly among individuals with a suicide attempt history. Conclusions: Several specific mood symptoms may confer risk for the onset or worsening of SI among treatmentâ€seeking patients with BD. Individuals with a previous suicide attempt may be at greater risk in part due to greater reactivity to certain mood symptoms in the form of SI. However, overall, effect sizes were small, suggesting the need to identify additional proximal predictors of SI.

1348,PTSD From a Suicide Attempt: Phenomenological and Diagnostic Considerations,"Objective: A suicide attempt is at least somewhat life-threatening by definition and is, for some, traumatic. Thus, it is possible that some individuals may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from a suicide attempt.; Method: In this article, we consider whether one's suicide attempt could fulfill Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for a PTSD Criterion A event and contribute to the development of attendant PTSD symptoms (e.g., flashbacks, avoidance, shame/guilt, nightmares); discuss theoretical models of PTSD as they relate to suicide attempts; reflect on factors that might influence rates of suicide attempt-related PTSD; highlight methodological limitations that have hampered our understanding of suicide attempt-related PTSD; and posit areas for future scientific and clinical inquiry.; Results: Strikingly, the degree to which a suicide attempt leads to PTSD is unknown.; Conclusions: We conclude with a call for research to systematically assess for suicide attempts alongside other potentially traumatic experiences (e.g., combat exposure, rape) that are included in standardized PTSD assessments.; ","Stanley, Ian H.; Boffa, Joseph W. & Joiner, Thomas E.",0,1348
1349,Differences in psychiatric symptoms and barriers to mental health care between volunteer and career firefighters,"Firefighters are at increased risk for mental health problems. However, little is known about differences in psychiatric symptoms between volunteer and career firefighters. This study aimed to (1) describe differences in psychiatric symptoms and barriers to mental health care between U.S. firefighters in volunteer-only and career-only departments; and (2) determine if greater self-reported structural barriers to mental health care (e.g., cost, availability of resources) explain the differences in psychiatric symptom levels. Overall, 525 current U.S. firefighters participated. Analyses of covariance and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate group differences between volunteer (n = 204) and career (n = 321) firefighters, adjusting for demographic and occupational characteristics. Volunteer firefighters reported significantly elevated levels of depression, posttraumatic stress, and suicidal symptoms compared to career firefighters. Career firefighters reported relatively elevated levels of problematic alcohol use. Volunteer firefighters additionally reported greater structural barriers to mental health care (e.g., cost, availability of resources), and these barriers accounted for the differences in mental health variables between volunteer and career firefighters. Findings suggest that volunteer firefighters report elevated psychiatric symptoms compared to career firefighters and greater structural barriers to mental health treatment may explain this link. Increased efforts are needed to develop firefighter-specific interventions and bolster mental health service utilization.

1350,Comorbid sleep disorders and suicide risk among children and adolescents with bipolar disorder,"Children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for suicide. Sleep disturbances are common among youth with bipolar disorder and are also independently implicated in suicide risk; thus, comorbid sleep disorders may amplify suicide risk in this clinical population. This study examined the effects of comorbid sleep disorders on suicide risk among youth with bipolar disorder. We conducted secondary analyses of baseline data from the Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM) study, a randomized controlled trial of individuals aged 6â€“15 years (mean Â± SD = 10.2 Â± 2.7 years) with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (N = 379). Sleep disorders (i.e., nightmare, sleep terror, and sleepwalking disorders) and suicide risk were assessed via the WASH-U-KSADS and the CDRS-R, respectively. We constructed uncontrolled logistic regression models as well as models controlling for trauma history, a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) diagnosis, and depression symptoms. Participants with a current comorbid nightmare disorder versus those without were nearly twice as likely to screen positive for suicide risk in an uncontrolled model and models controlling for trauma history, a GAD diagnosis, and depression symptoms. Neither a current comorbid sleep terror disorder nor a sleepwalking disorder was significantly associated with suicide risk. This pattern of findings remained consistent for both current and lifetime sleep disorder diagnoses. Youth with bipolar I disorder and a comorbid nightmare disorder appear to be at heightened suicide risk. Implications for assessment and treatment are discussed.

1351,Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD): A confirmatory factor analysis with 1442 psychiatric inpatients,"Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) is a newly proposed diagnostic entity that characterizes rapid onset suicidal intent. This study aims to confirm the factor structure of ASAD among psychiatric inpatients, and to determine the clinical utility of ASAD in predicting suicide attempt status. Overall, 1442 psychiatric inpatients completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms theorized to comprise the ASAD construct. Utilizing these data, a confirmatory factor analysis with a one-factor solution was performed. Regression analyses were employed to determine if the ASAD construct predicted past suicide attempts, and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were employed to determine if ASAD symptoms differed by the presence and number of past suicide attempts. The one-factor solution indicated good fit: Ï‡Â²(77) = 309.1, p < 0.001, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.96, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.97, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05. Controlling for depressive disorders and current symptoms, the ASAD construct significantly predicted the presence of a past suicide attempt. Moreover, ASAD differentiated in the expected directions between individuals with a history of multiple suicide attempts, individuals with a single suicide attempt, and individuals with no history of a suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) appears to be a unified construct that predicts suicidal behavior and is distinct from an already-defined mood disorder.

1352,"The popularity of benzodiazepines, their advantages, and inadequate pharmacological alternatives","Comments on an article by Mark Olfson et al. (see record [rid]2015-09338-009[/rid]). Olfson et al. reported higher rates of long-term benzodiazepine use among older adults in the United States and and stated alarmingly that most physicians do not view continuous use of benzodiazepines by older adults as a public health problem. Commentator argues that it would be useful to reconsider a number of negative notions about benzodiazepines that have not received unequivocal empirical support. Olfson et al. discussed the limitations of alternative hypnotic agents, such as zolpidem, but they hardly mentioned problems with commonly prescribed antidepressants. Problems include hyponatremia, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, osteoporosis with the risk for fractures, and sexual dysfunction. These adverse effects, in addition to the potential for drug interactions with certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and discontinuation problems, have led to a suggestion that benzodiazepines are much safer than antidepressants in the long-term treatment of anxiety disorders. There is no doubt that benzodiazepines need to be prescribed carefully, just like any other medication. However, the relatively high rate of benzodiazepine use in older adults needs better understanding instead of outright vilification.

1353,Specificity of Symptoms of Depression in Alzheimer Disease A Longitudinal Analysis: A Longitudinal Analysis,"Objective: Authors examined the temporal stability of symptoms of major and minor depression and apathy in dementia. Methods: A consecutive sample of 65 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and depression at baseline evaluation received a follow-up psychiatric assessment that included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression an average of 17 months later. Results: Half of the sample had no depression at follow-up, and showed a significant improvement in sadness, guilt, suicidal ideation, disruption in sleep, loss of interest, loss of energy, thoughts of death, social withdrawal, psychomotor changes, changes in appetite/weight, and symptoms of anxiety. No significant changes were found on scores of irritability or apathy. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the specificity of depressive symptoms in AD and suggests that apathy and depression are different behavioral domains.

1354,Predicting Suicide Ideation in the Military: The Independent Role of Aggression,"The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between aggression and suicide ideation when controlling for other externalizing (i.e., alcohol misuse and risk-taking) and internalizing (i.e., depression and sleep problems) risk factors in an active duty, military sample. Preexisting data from a longitudinal study were analyzed to assess the wellness of service members across the deployment cycle. Participants were 944 active duty service members (95% male, 48% between 18 and 24Â years old) who completed surveys upon initial return from deployment and approximately 3 months later. After controlling for other externalizing (alcohol misuse, risk-taking) and internalizing (depression, sleep problems) risk factors, service members reporting aggression were significantly more likely to report suicide ideation than those reporting no aggression (ORÂ =Â 3.19; OR 95% CI: 1.16-8.80). The independent nature of the relationship between anger and suicidality suggests aggression may be an important indicator of suicidality for service members.

1356,Translating research for professional development and effective clinical practice with older adults,"This paper offers a commentary on the articles in the special series on cognitive behavior therapy with older adults (Carmin, 2012-this issue), noting the commonalities found across discussions of diagnostic interviewing and cognitive-behavioral assessment and treatment for late-life insomnia, depression and suicide risk, PTSD, and OCD. These case studies demonstrate best practices in the application of cognitive-behavioral strategies for assessment and intervention with a diverse range of older adults. Clinicians can improve the effectiveness of their work with aging clients by expanding their skills in assessment and managing interprofessional relationships in integrated health-care settings. Reflected by the papers in this series, ongoing professional development and research attention are both essential as clinicians from the mental health disciplines increase provision of CBT with older adults. Treatments for specific disorders and problems will also benefit from the growing literature on successful aging, and the application of positive psychology in our future collaborations with older adults and their care partners.

1357,"Does the outcome of a first pregnancy predict depression, suicidal ideation, or lower self-esteem? Data from the National Comorbidity Survey","This study examines the risk of depression, suicidal ideation, and lower self-esteem following an abortion versus a delivery, with and without adjusting for important correlates. Using the National Comorbidity Survey, we tested how first pregnancy outcome (abortion vs. delivery) related to subsequent major depression, suicidal ideation, and self-esteem. Models controlling for risk factors, such as background and economic factors, prepregnancy violence experience, and prepregnancy mental health, as well as a model with all risk factors, were examined. When no risk factors were entered in the model, women who had abortions were more likely to have subsequent depression, OR=1.53, 95% CI [1.05-2.22], and suicidal ideation, OR=2.02, 95% CI [1.40-2.92], but they were not more likely to have lower self-esteem, B=-.02. When all risk factors were entered, pregnancy outcome was not significantly related to later depression, OR=0.87, 95% CI [0.54-1.37], and suicidal ideation, OR=1.19, 95% CI [0.70-2.02]. Predictors of mental health following abortion and delivery included prepregnancy depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual violence. Policies and practices implemented in response to the claim that abortion hurts women are not supported by our findings. Efforts to support women's mental health should focus on known risk factors, such as gender-based violence and prior mental health problems, rather than abortion history.; Â© 2011 American Orthopsychiatric Association.Self Concept*, Suicidal Ideation*, Abortion, Induced/*psychology, Depression/*psychology, Pregnancy Outcome/*psychology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Mental Health, Odds Ratio, Pregnancy, Risk Factors","Steinberg, Julia R; Becker, Davida & Henderson, Jillian T",0,1357
1358,Cumulative childhood maltreatment and its dose-response relation with adult symptomatology: Findings in a sample of adult survivors of sexual abuse,"In the present study, we examined the role of cumulative childhood maltreatment experiences for several health related outcomes in adulthood, including symptoms of psychological distress as well as perceived social support and hardiness. The sample comprised adult survivors of sexual abuse (N = 278, 95.3% women, mean age at first abusive incident = 6.4 years). One-way ANOVAs revealed a statistically significant dose-response relation between cumulative childhood maltreatment scores and self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, depression, eating disorders, dissociation, insomnia, nightmare related distress, physical pain, emotional pain, relational problems, self-harm behaviors as well as on a measure of symptom complexity. Cumulative childhood maltreatment was also associated with lower levels of work functioning. An inverse dose-response relation was found for perceived social support and hardiness. Using a Bonferroni corrected alpha level, cumulative childhood maltreatment remained significantly associated with all outcome measures with the exception of eating disorder symptoms after controlling for abuse-related independent variables in hierarchical regression analyses. Results add to previous literature by showing that dose-response relation between cumulative childhood adversities and adult symptom outcomes could also be identified in a sample characterized by high exposure to adversities, and lends support to the notion put forth by previous authors that cumulative childhood adversities seem to be related to the severity of adult health outcomes in a rule-governed way.

Electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews in February 2018. Eligible reviews reported associations between time on screens (screentime; any type) and any health/well-being outcome in CYP. Quality of reviews was assessed and strength of evidence across reviews evaluated.; Results: 13 reviews were identified (1 high quality, 9 medium and 3 low quality). 6 addressed body composition; 3 diet/energy intake; 7 mental health; 4 cardiovascular risk; 4 for fitness; 3 for sleep; 1 pain; 1 asthma. We found moderately strong evidence for associations between screentime and greater obesity/adiposity and higher depressive symptoms; moderate evidence for an association between screentime and higher energy intake, less healthy diet quality and poorer quality of life. There was weak evidence for associations of screentime with behaviour problems, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, poorer self-esteem, poorer well-being and poorer psychosocial health, metabolic syndrome, poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, poorer cognitive development and lower educational attainments and poor sleep outcomes. There was no or insufficient evidence for an association of screentime with eating disorders or suicidal ideation, individual cardiovascular risk factors, asthma prevalence or pain. Evidence for threshold effects was weak. We found weak evidence that small amounts of daily screen use is not harmful and may have some benefits.; Conclusions: There is evidence that higher levels of screentime is associated with a variety of health harms for CYP, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life.

1361,Psychopharmacology in pediatric critical care,"Psychopharmacologic treatment in pediatric critical care requires a careful child or adolescent psychiatric evaluation, including a thorough review of the history of present illness or injury, any current or pre-existing psychiatric disorder, past history, and laboratory studies. Although there is limited evidence to guide psychopharmacologic practice in this setting, psychopharmacologic treatment is increasing in critical care, with known indications for treatment, benefits, and risks; initial dosing guidelines; and best practices. Treatment is guided by the knowledge bases in pediatric physiology, psycho-pharmacology, and treatment of critically ill adults. Pharmacologic considerations include pharmacokinetic and pharmcodynamic aspects of specific drugs and drug classes, in particular elimination half-life, developmental considerations, drug interactions, and adverse effects. Evaluation and management of pain is a key initial step, as pain may mimic psychiatric symptoms and its effective treatment can ameliorate them. Patient comfort and safety are primary objectives for children who are acutely ill and who will survive and for those who will not. Judicious use of psychopharmacolgic agents in pediatric critical care using the limited but growing evidence base and a clinical best practices collaborative approach can reduce anxiety,sadness, disorientation, and agitation; improve analgesia; and save lives of children who are suicidal or delirious. In addition to pain, other disorders or indications for psychopharmacologic treatment are affective disorders;PTSD; post-suicide attempt patients; disruptive behavior disorders (especially ADHD); and adjustment, developmental, and substance use disorders. Treating children who are critically ill with psychotropic drugs is an integral component of comprehensive pediatric critical care in relieving pain and delirium; reducing inattention or agitation or aggressive behavior;relieving acute stress, anxiety, or depression; and improving sleep and nutrition. In palliative care, psychopharmacology is integrated with psychologicapproaches to enhance children's comfort at the end of life. Defining how best to prevent the adverse consequences of suffering and stress in pediatric critical care is a goal for protocols and for new psychopharmacologic research [23,153].;Critical Illness*, Critical Care/*methods, Depression/*drug therapy, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*drug therapy, Biotransformation, Child, Family/psychology, Humans, Pain/diagnosis, Pain Measurement, Palliative Care/methods, Psychotropic Drugs/pharmacokinetics, Referral and Consultation","Stoddard, Frederick J; Usher, Craigan T & Abrams, Annah N",0,1361
1362,A primary care perspective on management of acute and long-term depression,"Major depressive disorder causing social and physical dysfunction and risk of suicide is frequently seen in family practice, often presenting with somatic symptoms, sleep problems, or anxiety. Correct diagnosis allows prompt treatment with decreased morbidity and mortality. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) selective reuptake inhibitors have a more benign side effect profile and are much safer in overdose than older drugs. Patient education is essential regarding (1) the medical nature of this disorder, (2) its effective treatment with pharmacotherapy, and (3) the need to continue full-dose maintenance therapy for 6-9 mo after complete remission of the depressive episode to prevent relapse. Recognition of the recurrent nature of this illness is mandatory, and chronic (lifetime) full-dose prophylactic therapy is often necessary.

1363,Behavioral and neurophysiological signatures of benzodiazepine-related driving impairments,"Impaired driving due to drug use is a growing problem worldwide; estimates show that 18â€“23.5% of fatal accidents, and up to 34% of injury accidents may be caused by drivers under the influence of drugs (Drummer et al., 2003; Walsh et al., 2004; NHTSA, 2010). Furthermore, at any given time, up to 16% of drivers may be using drugs that can impair oneâ€™s driving abilities (NHTSA, 2009). Currently, drug recognition experts (DREs; law enforcement officers with specialized training to identify drugged driving), have the most difficult time with identifying drivers potentially impaired on central nervous system (CNS) depressants (Smith et al., 2002). The fact that the use of benzodiazepines, a type of CNS depressant, is also associated with the greatest likelihood of causing accidents (Dassanayake et al., 2011), further emphasizes the need to improve research tools in this area which can facilitate the refinement of, or additions to, current assessments of impaired driving. Our laboratories collaborated to evaluate both the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of a benzodiazepine, alprazolam, in a driving simulation (miniSimTM). This drive was combined with a neurocognitive assessment utilizing time synched neurophysiology (electroencephalography, ECG). While the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines are well characterized (Rapoport et al., 2009), we hypothesized that, with the addition of real-time neurophysiology and the utilization of simulation and neurocognitive assessment, we could find objective assessments of drug impairment that could improve the detection capabilities of DREs. Our analyses revealed that (1) specific driving conditions were significantly more difficult for benzodiazepine impaired drivers and (2) the neurocognitive tasksâ€™ metrics were able to classify 'impaired' vs. 'unimpaired' with up to 80% accuracy based on lane position deviation and lane departures. While this work requires replication in larger studies, our results not only identified criteria that could potentially improve the identification of benzodiazepine intoxication by DREs, but also demonstrated the promise for future studies using this approach to improve upon current, real-world assessments of impaired driving.

1367,A population study of the association between sleep disturbance and suicidal behaviour in people with mental illness,"Limited representative research has considered the relationship between sleep disturbance and suicidal behaviour among people with mental illness. We investigated the relationship between sleep disturbance and suicidal behaviour across Part II interview of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCSR). The associations between sleep disturbance and suicidal behaviour (thoughts, plans and attempts) were investigated using logistic and multinomial logistic regressions and stratified across six mental disorder groups (depression, anxiety, substance use disorders (SUD), eating disorders (ED), bipolar disorders (BD) and early life disorders). From 5701 participants (mean age 43.4 years 58% women), people with any mental disorder experiencing sleep disturbance were at increased odds of suicidal thoughts (odds ratio (OR): 2.5; 95% CI: 1.7, 3.6) and suicidal plans and attempts (OR: 5.7; 95% CI: 2.7, 11.9) adjusting for age, sex and income. People with BD (OR: 8.9; 95 CI: 2.1, 38.1), early life disorders (OR 6.98, 95% ci 2.48, 19.67), depression (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.14, 3.11), anxiety (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.28, 2.85) and SUD (2.60, 95% CI 1.23, 5.49) but not ED, were at increased odds of suicidal thoughts in the presence of sleep disturbance. Adjusting for anti-depressant intake attenuated the effect sizes by up to 20% but the associations remained significant. In conclusion, sleep disturbance is a potential risk factor for suicidal behaviours in people with mental illness. Monitoring and management of sleep disturbance in clinical practice might be an important strategy to mitigate suicidal behaviours in people with mental illness.

1368,Risk profiles of personality traits for suicidality among mood disorder patients and community controls,"Objective: To examine the associations between personality traits and suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in mood disorder patients and community controls. Method: We recruited 365 bipolar, 296 major depressive disorder patients, and 315 community controls to assess their lifetime suicidality. Participants filled out self-reported personality questionnaires to collect data of personality traits, including novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), extraversion (E), and neuroticism (N). We used logistic regression models adjusted for diagnoses to analyze combinational effects of personality traits on the risk of suicide. Additionally, radar charts display personality profiles for suicidal behaviours by groups. Results: All personality traits were associated with the risk of suicidality with various effect size, except for E that showed protective effect. High N or HA had prominent and independent risk effects on SI and SA. Combinations of high N and low E, or high HA and NS were the risk personality profiles for suicidality. Higher N scores further distinguished SA from SI in mood disorder patients. Conclusion: Introvert personality traits showed independent risk effects on suicidality regardless of diagnosis status. Among high-risk individuals with suicidal thoughts, higher neuroticism tendency is further associated with increased risk of suicide attempt.

1369,Bipolar disorder in Asia: Illness course and contributing factors,"Background: Epidemiological studies analysing the course of Bipolar Disorder (BD) are relatively rare in the Asian context, contributing to the uncertainty regarding the prevalent course patterns and factors influencing such patterns. The current review identifies the regional characteristics of BD course patterns and the associated factors. Methods: A review of the existing literature was done using â€˜PubMedâ€™ and â€˜Cochraneâ€™ databases which yielded 145 studies including those from all 48 Asian countries. Relevant discussions from the Western literature were incorporated. Results: Regional and cross-national studies reveal a mania-predominant course in BD in Asian countries. Prolonged depressive episodes and comorbid anxiety disorders worsen the course of BD-II. Certain risk factors such as the young age of onset and greater episode frequency are useful predictors of bipolar diatheses. Substance use disorder comorbidity is more prevalent in males whereas depression and suicidal behaviours are more frequent in females with BD. Comorbid anxiety and personality disorders also encumber the illness course. Logistic reasons and ignorance of side-effects were specifically associated with poor adherence. An â€˜eveningnessâ€™ chronotype and poor sleep quality were associated with frequent recurrences. Seasonal patterns vary among men and women, especially for depressive episodes. Limitations: The effects of treatment and childhood BD course features were not discussed. Conclusions: There are region-specific characteristics in bipolar illness course and factors influencing such course patterns compared to the rest of the World. Future research from Asia shall attempt to study the neurobiological underpinnings of such characteristics and plan appropriate strategies to address the same.

1371,Gender differences in factors associated with suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms among middle-aged workers in Japan,"The purpose of this study was to assess middle-aged Japanese workers for possible gender differences in the risk factors associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. 5,878 workers (40-60 yr of age) (3,631 males and 2,247 females) were recruited from randomly selected companies in northern Japan. Demographic and lifestyle factors, suicidal ideation rate, and the data for the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies for Depression scale (CES-D) were obtained from the self-report questionnaires. After adjusting for possible confounding variables, marital status, absent of stress reduction technique and low job compatibility were significant independent risk factors for suicidal ideation among males. In females, marital status, feeling of insufficient sleep and absence of stress reduction techniques were significant independent risk factors after adjusting for all variables. Under the same adjustments, temporary employment also showed a protective effect against female suicidal ideation. In conclusion, our results suggest that factors related to suicidal ideation differed by gender. Different approaches for each gender might be useful in the development of suicide prevention programs. However, interpretation of work-related effects, such as temporary employment, interpersonal conflict and transportation industry, was hampered by lack of data concerning personal income, working hours and organizational commitment.

Individuals were classified into no insomnia (NI), single episode insomnia (SEI), and persistent insomnia (PI; â‰¥ insomnia at 2+ time points) groups based on number of times insomnia was indicated. Mixed effects modeling indicated that depression scores increased significantly faster in the PI group compared to the NI (P < 0.001) and SEI (P = 0.02) groups. Additionally, the PI group had significantly increased odds of depression as compared to NI or SEI (OR 2.44, P = 0.001) groups, with 18.7% meeting criteria for depression compared to the NI (5.3%) and SEI (11.6%) groups at end point. The PI group also had significantly increased odds of suicidal ideation as compared to NI or SEI (OR 1.86, P = 0.002) groups. Conclusions: Persistent insomnia significantly increases the rate in which depression occurs over time in non-depressed individuals, which ultimately leads to higher risk for depression. Additionally, having persistent insomnia also increased the risk of suicidal ideation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1373,Validation of the Korean Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale,"Objective: The present study aimed to validate a Korean version of the self-report Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS).; Methods: 553 South Korean undergraduate students (aged 18-34 years, 74.8% females) completed questionnaires. Participants completed Korean versions of the self-report Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), and a measure of suicide-related symptom history.; Results: Results indicated that the DSI-SS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Î±=0.93) and strong convergent validity with the BDI (r=0.57, p<0.01), ISI (r=0.27, p<0.01), and BSS (r=0.70, p<0.01). DSI-SS scores also significantly differentiated between those reporting a history of suicide attempts compared to non-suicide attempters [t (38.80)=-3.28, p<0.05].; Conclusion: Given the brevity of this measure, and evidence for its validity, the Korean version of the DSI-SS may be particularly promising for clinical and empirical use as a screening tool among South Korean undergraduates.; Korea, Risk assessment, Suicidal ideation, Suicide attempted, Validation studies","Suh, Sooyeon; Ryu, Hyera; Chu, Carol; Hom, Melanie; Rogers, Megan L. & Joiner, Thomas",0,1373
1374,Predictors of acute stress disorder severity,"Background: The DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress disorder (ASD) describes a posttraumatic reaction that occurs two to twenty-eight days following a trauma and involves symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, hyper-arousal and dissociation. A better understanding of ASD and its pathogenesis could lead to improved post-trauma health care interventions. The aim of this study was to determine prospectively whether a combination of clinical, cognitive and demographic variables were predictive of ASD severity in an acutely traumatized sample. Methods: We assessed demographic (e.g. age, gender, education), clinical (e.g. sleep quality, trait anxiety, previous psychiatric diagnoses), and cognitive (e.g. negative cognitions following trauma) variables in a sample of 125 adult motor vehicle accident survivors (age: 32.2679.99; gender: 56.6% male) approximately 10 days after the accident. Univariate analyes and stepwise linear regression were performed to identify variables predictive of ASD severity. Results: Although a number of factors were individually associated with ASD severity, in a regression model only 3 factors, trait anxiety, suicide risk and post-traumatic cognitions, emerged as predictive of the severity of the disorder. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study and use of self-report measures are important to bear in mind. Conclusions: Higher levels of trait anxiety, risk for suicide and negative appraisals of the traumatic event were predictive of ASD severity. As these factors may help to identify those who may be at risk of more severe responses after a traumatic event, and who may benefit from secondary prevention strategies, they should be assessed for in acute trauma survivors.

1375,Association of Primary Care Consultation Patterns With Early Signs and Symptoms of Psychosis,"Importance: Primary care is an important part of the care pathway for patients with psychosis; therefore, primary care physicians need to be able to accurately identify those at clinical high risk of psychosis. The difficulty of this task is increased because clinical high-risk symptoms are frequently nonspecific to psychosis.; Objective: To determine whether the consultation patterns for a prespecified set of symptoms can be used to identify primary care patients who later developed a psychotic illness.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study used primary care consultation data collected from 530 primary care practices in 13 UK regions from January 1, 2000, through September 30, 2009. Participants included 11â€¯690 adults with a diagnosis of psychosis and 81â€¯793 control participants who did not have a diagnosis of psychosis individually matched by age group, sex, and primary care practice. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2015, through June 2, 2017.; Exposures: Prespecified symptoms selected from literature included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms, bizarre behavior, blunted affect, problems associated with cannabis, depressive symptoms, role functioning problems, social isolation, symptoms of mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder-like symptoms, disordered personal hygiene, sleep disturbance, problems associated with cigarette smoking, and suicidal behavior (including self-harm).; Main Outcomes and Measures: Case (diagnosis of psychosis) or control (no diagnosis of psychosis) status. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association between symptoms and case-control status in the 5 years before diagnosis. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated using the Bayes theorem for symptoms stratified by age group and sex. Repeated-measures Poisson regression was used to investigate symptom consultation rate.; Results: Of the total sample of 93â€¯483 participants, 57.4% were female and 40.0% were older than 60 years (mean [SD] age, 51.34 [21.75] years). Twelve symptoms were associated with a later psychotic diagnosis (all prespecified symptoms except disordered personal hygiene). The strongest association was with suicidal behavior (odds ratio [OR], 19.06; 95% CI, 16.55-21.95). Positive predictive values were heterogeneous across age and sex. The highest PPVs were for suicidal behavior (33.0% in men 24 years or younger [95% CI, 24.2%-43.2%] and 19.6% in women aged 25-34 years [95% CI, 13.7%-27.2%]). Pairs of symptoms were associated with an increase in PPV. Consultation rates were higher in cases and increased 3 months before diagnosis.; Conclusions and Relevance: Most of the preselected nonspecific symptoms were associated with a later psychotic diagnosis, particularly among young men consulting for suicidal behavior, especially if consulting with increasing frequency. These symptoms should alert physicians to patients who may benefit from a further assessment of psychotic symptoms.; ","Sullivan, Sarah A.; Hamilton, William; Tilling, Kate; Redaniel, Theresa; Moran, Paul & Lewis, Glyn",1,1375
1376,Sleep disturbances and suicide”new battles for veterans of uS Wars in afghanistan and iraq: A retrospective review,"In this article, we systematically reviewed 116 veteransâ€™ medical records to explore the mitigating factors in sleep disturbance, polytrauma clinical triad (PCT), and suicide. We discovered that a particular nonaction (i.e., no standardized completion of sleep-disturbance screenings) had strong implications for resulting suicides among veterans with reported sleep disturbances, PCT, and suicidal ideations. This study provides strong propositions for the further study of this veteran cohortâ€”Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New Dawn (OND)â€”with regard to the impact of sleep disturbance on PCT and its relationship with suicide symptoms, ideation, and completion. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of sleep disturbances on complex relationships among the three primary diagnosesâ€”posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and chronic painâ€”that establish the PCT cluster. We identified that those diagnosed with sleep disturbances had increased suicidal ideations and rates of completed suicides. We analyzed these factors in veterans returning from the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We hypothesized that (a) clinicians were not completing sleep-disturbance screenings as a standard practice for the OEF/OIF/OND veterans diagnosed with PCT who reported sleep disturbance concerns within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; (b) if no sleep-disturbance screening instruments were used by clinicians, veterans would be at a greater risk of suicide completion.

1377,The Sri Lankan Twin Registry: 2012 update,"The Sri Lankan Twin Registry (SLTR), established in 1997, is a unique resource for twin and genetic research in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). It comprises of a volunteer cohort of 14,120 twins (7,060 pairs) and 119 sets of triplets, and a population-based cohort of 19,040 (9,520 pairs) twins and 89 sets of triplets. Several studies have been conducted using this registry, including the Colombo Twin and Singleton Study (CoTaSS 1; 4,387 twins, 2,311 singletons), which have explored the prevalence and heritability of a range of psychiatric disorders as well as gene-environmental interplay. Currently, a follow-up study (CoTaSS 2) of the same cohort is underway, looking at the prevalence and interrelationship of key cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers (e.g., metabolic syndrome). A significant feature of CoTaSS 2 is the establishment of a biobank. Current SLTR work is extending beyond mental health and the interface between mental and physical health to new horizons, extending collaborations with the wider global twin research community. Ethics and governance have been given special emphasis in the initiative. Capacity building and public engagement are two crucial components. Establishment of a state-of-the-art genetic laboratory was a major accomplishment. SLTR is a classic showcase of successful North-South partnership in building a progressive research infrastructure in a LMIC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

1378,"Insomnia symptom, mental disorder and suicide: A casecontrol study in chinese rural youths","Insomnia has been reported as a risk factor of suicidal behaviors, but few studies have examined the association among insomnia, mental disorder and suicide, especially among Chinese populations. In this study, we examined the effect of insomnia symptoms on completed suicide in a large sample of suicides and their controls in Chinese rural youths. Subjects were 388 consecutively recruited suicides and 416 community living controls aged 15-34 years in the rural areas of three provinces in China. Established psychological autopsy method was used for data collection. Insomnia symptoms were assessed with sleep questions in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) about insomnia, including difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) and early morning awakening (EMA). The results showed that DIS (OR = 12.01, P < 0.001), DMS (OR = 12.82, P < 0.001) or EMA (OR = 12.08, P < 0.001) was significantly associated with increased risk of suicide even after mental disorder was controlled for. Our study showed that insomnia can be an independent risk factor for suicide. Mental disorders mediated the association between insomnia and suicide. Insomnia should be assessed and treated for individuals at risk of suicide. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

1379,Association Between Zolpidem and Suicide: A Nationwide Population-Based Case-Control Study,"Objective: To evaluate the association between zolpidem and the risk of suicide.; Patients and Methods: In this nationwide case-control study, the case group comprised 2199 people who committed suicide or were hospitalized due to suicide attempt between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2011. To create a control group, we randomly selected 10 people matched to each case according to age, sex, urbanization, and occupation. We measured the risk of suicide/suicide attempt in association with zolpidem exposure by using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and assessed the dose-response effect of zolpidem.; Results: After adjustment for potential confounders such as the comorbidities of schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, insomnia, substance use, and other mental disorders, the Charlson comorbidity index, and use of benzodiazepine or antidepressants, zolpidem exposure was found to be significantly associated with the risk of suicide/suicide attempt with an OR of 2.08 (95% CIs, 1.83-2.36). The risk increased with the level of zolpidem use. The ORs (95% CIs) for cumulative defined daily doses of less than 90, 90 to 179, and 180 mg or more were 1.90 (1.65-2.18), 2.07 (1.59-2.67), and 2.81 (2.33-3.38), respectively (for trend, P<.001). Subgroup analyses showed that the exposure to zolpidem consistently increased the OR in different age groups, sex, urbanization level, occupation, mental disorders, and Charlson comorbidity index levels and in groups of people with or without the presence of insomnia.; Conclusion: This study demonstrated a significant association between using zolpidem and suicide or suicide attempt in people with or without comorbid psychiatric illnesses (all P<.05).; Copyright Â© 2016 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

1380,"The Impact of Sleep Timing, Sleep Duration, and Sleep Quality on Depressive Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation amongst Japanese Freshmen: The EQUSITE Study","Aim. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of bedtime, wake time, sleep duration, sleep-onset latency, and sleep quality on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation amongst Japanese freshmen. Methods. This cross-sectional data was derived from the baseline survey of the Enhancement of Q-University Students Intelligence (EQUSITE) study conducted from May to June, 2010. A total of 2,631 participants were recruited and completed the following self-reported questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the original Health Support Questionnaires developed by the EQUSITE study research team. Results. Of 1,992 participants eligible for analysis, 25.5% (n = 507) reported depressive symptoms (CES-D total score â‰¥ 16), and 5.8% (n = 115) reported suicidal ideation. The present study showed that late bedtime (later than 01:30), sleep-onset latency (â‰¥30 minutes), and poor sleep quality showed a marginally significant association with depressive symptoms. Poor sleep quality was seen to predict suicidal ideation even after adjusting for depressive symptoms. Conclusion. The current study has important implications for the role of bedtime in the prevention of depressive symptoms. Improving sleep quality may prevent the development of depressive symptoms and reduce the likelihood of suicidal ideation.; ","Supartini, Atin; Honda, Takanori; Basri, Nadzirah A.; Haeuchi, Yuka; Chen, Sanmei; Ichimiya, Atsushi & Kumagai, Shuzo",0,1380
1381,Prospective Longitudinal Study of Predictors of Postpartum-Onset Depression in Women With a History of Major Depressive Disorder,"Objective: Risk factors for postpartum depression in euthymic pregnant women with histories of major depressive disorder (MDD) were evaluated.; Methods: From April 2003 to March 2009, 343 pregnant women with a history of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-diagnosed major depressive disorder were prospectively assessed from the third trimester into the postpartum period using the SCID mood module and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Data from 300 subjects who completed at least 2 mood module assessments (1 within 60 days before and the other within 60 days after delivery) were analyzed for predictive associations between variables assessed in the third trimester and the development of a postpartum depression.; Results: The majority of women were euthymic in pregnancy by SCID criteria. Women with third trimester SCID-diagnosed depression (n = 45) versus euthymia (n = 255) had a significantly higher risk for having depression after delivery (24% vs 11%, P = .013). For pregnant euthymic women, third trimester total HDRS scores significantly predicted postpartum depression (P < .0001); specifically, scores on 3 HDRS items alone-work activities, early insomnia, and suicidality-significantly predicted postpartum depression. Antidepressant use in the third trimester in euthymic women did not confer protection against the onset of postpartum depression.; Conclusions: Among women with a history of MDD who are euthymic in the third trimester, 3 HDRS items-work activities, early insomnia, and suicidality-may be useful as screening items for clinicians working with pregnant women with histories of MDD to identify a group at risk for developing postpartum depression. Additionally, in euthymic women with a history of MDD, antidepressant use in the third trimester may not reduce the risk of developing postpartum depression.; Â© Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Depression, Postpartum*/diagnosis, Depression, Postpartum*/epidemiology, Depression, Postpartum*/prevention & control, Depression, Postpartum*/psychology, Depressive Disorder, Major/*diagnosis, Pregnancy Trimester, Third/*psychology, Adult, Affect, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy, Depressive Disorder, Major/psychology, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Female, Humans, Interview, Psychological/methods, Medical History Taking, Predictive Value of Tests, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Prognosis, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/diagnosis, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Suicidal Ideation, United States/epidemiology","Suri, Rita; Stowe, Zachary N.; Cohen, Lee S.; Newport, D.

1382,The association between complete and partial non-response to psychosocial questions and suicide: The JPHC Study,"Background: Non-participants to psychosocial studies have been shown to have higher mortality, and mortality differs between partial and complete responders to psychosocial questionnaires. Yet, there is very little information available directly linking survey response status with completing suicide. Methods: The study population consisted of the participants of the Japanese Public Health Center-based prospective study. Ninety-nine thousand four hundred thirty-nine subjects who returned the 10-year follow-up questionnaire and 31 754 individuals who did not return the questionnaire were included in our analyses. The risk of dying by suicide according to response status was estimated by Cox regression models. Results: There were 358 suicides during 1 128 831 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up time: 8.6 years). Of those who returned the questionnaire, 53.9% were full responders, 42.8% were partial non-responders, and 3.3% were complete non-responders. The risk of suicide was increased for both complete non-responders [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51, 6.64] and partial non-responders (HR = 1.36, 95% CI, 0.999, 1.84) to the questionnaire as a whole. The adjusting variables explained around 40% of the risk for complete non-responders whereas they did not explain the increased risk of suicide for partial non-responders. The risk of dying by suicide was significantly increased for partial nonresponders to the subscale on coping (HR = 1.36, 95% CI, 1.01, 1.85) and for complete non-responders to questions on sleep (HR = 2.07, 95% CI, 1.03, 4.16). Conclusions: Partial and complete non-responders have increased suicide risk compared with full responders. More than one non-responder category should therefore be considered when interpreting data pertaining to psychosocial questionnaires in longitudinal studies.

1383,The stress system in the human brain in depression and neurodegeneration,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a central role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, i.e., the final common pathway in the stress response. The action of CRH on ACTH release is strongly potentiated by vasopressin, that is co-produced in increasing amounts when the hypothalamic paraventricular neurons are chronically activated. Whereas vasopressin stimulates ACTH release in humans, oxytocin inhibits it. ACTH release results in the release of corticosteroids from the adrenal that, subsequently, through mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, exert negative feedback on, among other things, the hippocampus, the pituitary and the hypothalamus. The most important glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol, present in higher levels in women than in men. During aging, the activation of the CRH neurons is modest compared to the extra activation observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the even stronger increase in major depression. The HPA-axis is hyperactive in depression, due to genetic factors or due to aversive stimuli that may occur during early development or adult life. At least five interacting hypothalamic peptidergic systems are involved in the symptoms of major depression. Increased production of vasopressin in depression does not only occur in neurons that colocalize CRH, but also in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), which may lead to increased plasma levels of vasopressin, that have been related to an enhanced suicide risk. The increased activity of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) may be related to the eating disorders in depression. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), i.e., the biological clock of the brain, shows lower vasopressin production and a smaller circadian amplitude in depression, which may explain the sleeping problems in this disorder and may contribute to the strong CRH activation. The hypothalamo-pituitary thyroid (HPT)-axis is inhibited in depression. These hypothalamic peptidergic systems, i.e., the HPA-axis, the SCN, the SON and the HPT-axis, have many interactions with aminergic systems that are also implicated in depression. CRH neurons are strongly activated in depressed patients, and so is their HPA-axis, at all levels, but the individual variability is large. It is hypothesized that particularly a subgroup of CRH neurons that projects into the brain is activated in depression and induces the symptoms of this disorder. On the other hand, there is also a lot of evidence for a direct involvement of glucocorticoids in the etiology and symptoms of depression. Although there is a close association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CRH and alterations in the HPA-axis in depression, much of the CRH in CSF is likely to be derived from sources other than the PVN. Furthermore, a close interaction between the HPA-axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)-axis exists. Organizing effects during fetal life as well as activating effects of sex hormones on the HPA-axis have been reported. Such mechanisms may be a basis for the higher prevalence of mood disorders in women as compared to men. In addition, the stress system is affected by changing levels of sex hormones, as found, e.g., in the premenstrual period, ante- and postpartum, during the transition phase to the menopause and during the use of oral contraceptives. In depressed women, plasma levels of estrogen are usually lower and plasma levels of androgens are increased, while testosterone levels are decreased in depressed men. This is explained by the fact that both in depressed males and females the HPA-axis is increased in activity, parallel to a diminished HPG-axis, while the major source of androgens in women is the adrenal, whereas in men it is the testes. It is speculated, however, that in the etiology of depression the relative levels of sex hormones play a more important role than their absolute levels. Sex hormone replacement therapy indeed seems to improve mood in elderly people and AD patients. Studies of rats have shown that high levels of cumulative corticosteroid exposure and rather extreme chronic stress induce neuronal damage that selectively affects hippocampal structure. Studies performed under less extreme circumstances have so far provided conflicting data. The corticosteroid neurotoxicity hypothesis that evolved as a result of these initial observations is, however, not supported by clinical and experimental observations. In a few recent postmortem studies in patients treated with corticosteroids and patients who had been seriously and chronically depressed no indications for AD neuropathology, massive cell loss, or loss of plasticity could be found, while the incidence of apoptosis was extremely rare and only seen outside regions expected to be at risk for steroid overexposure. In addition, various recent experimental studies using good stereological methods failed to find massive cell loss in the hippocampus following exposure to stress or steroids, but rather showed adaptive and reversible changes in structural parameters after stress. Thus, the HPA-axis in AD is only moderately activated, possibly due to the initial (primary) hippocampal degeneration in this condition. There are no convincing arguments to presume a causal, primary role for cortisol in the pathogenesis of AD. Although cortisol and CRH may well be causally involved in the signs and symptoms of depression, there is so far no evidence for any major irreversible damage in the human hippocampus in this disorder.; Aging/*pathology, Brain/*pathology, Depressive Disorder/*pathology, Nerve Degeneration/*pathology, Stress, Physiological/*pathology, Depressive Disorder/physiopathology, Humans, Nerve Degeneration/physiopathology, Stress, Physiological/physiopathology","Swaab, Dick F.; Bao, Ai-Min & Lucassen, Paul J.",0,1383
1384,Intimate partner violence: Perspectives on universal screening for women in VHA primary care,"This article provide some perspectives on universal screening for women in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care. Intimate partner violence (IPV) poses a significant threat to public health and safety, particularly for women, in the United States. IPV can be defined as physical violence, sexual violence, threats of physical or sexual violence, and stalking and psychological aggression by a current or former intimate partner. Women veterans using VHA facilities for their health and mental health care often demonstrate diminished physical and mental health relative to their civilian peers and this difference in health status is attributed, at least in part, to women veteransâ€™ greater exposure to trauma. IPV exposure may be an under appreciated factor contributing to the relatively poorer physical and mental health outcomes for women veterans. IPV has also been linked to other deleterious mental health consequences including increased rates of suicide attempts, sleep disturbances, problematic substance use, and ineffective coping. The significant prevalence of IPV exposure among female veterans coupled with its serious implications for their health and well-being suggests a strong need for the development of a standard, universal screening program designed to detect IPV risk among women seeking services within VHA.

The current study examined the association between sleep duration, mental health problems, and health risk behaviors in a large sample of U.S. Afghanistan/Iraq era veterans. Design: . Setting: Mid-Atlantic VA Medical Center(s). Patients/Participants: The sample (N = 1,640) included 20% women (n = 333) and had an average age of 37 years (SD = 10.0). Interventions: . Measurements and Results: Results from logistic regression analyses that included age, minority status, gender, military rank, number of deployments, combat exposure, and health risk behaviors as covariates indicated that very short sleep duration (â‰¤ 5 h of sleep) and long sleep duration (â‰¥ 9 h) were each associated with increased odds of current post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and smoking; while poor sleep quality was associated with PTSD, panic disorder (PD), MDD, suicidal ideation (SI), and risky drinking. Conclusions: Sleep duration may be an important marker for psychiatric and health risk behavior problems, and our results suggest that clinical assessment of sleep disturbance in this veteran group is warranted to assess for both short and long sleep.

1386,Sleep disturbance in euthymic bipolar patients,"Sleep disturbance is a common feature during mood episodes in bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of such symptoms among euthymic bipolar patients, and their association with risk for mood episode recurrence. A cohort of bipolar I and II subjects participating in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder who were euthymic for at least 8 weeks were included in this analysis. Survival analysis was used to examine the association between sleep disturbance on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and recurrence risk. A total of 73/483 bipolar I and II subjects reported at least mild sleep disturbance (MADRS sleep item â‰¥ 2) for the week prior to study entry. The presence of sleep problems was associated with a history of psychosis, number of previous suicide attempts, and anticonvulsant use. Sleep disturbance at study entry was significantly associated with risk for mood episode recurrence. Sleep disturbance is not uncommon between episodes for individuals with bipolar disorder and may be associated with a more severe course of illness. This suggests that sleep disturbance is an important prodromal symptom of bipolar disorder and should be considered a target for pharmacologic or psychosocial maintenance treatment.

Ss were recorded as asleep or awake during 30 min intervals for 8 hrs per night. The results of a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated that Ss with self-injury slept significantly less than Ss without self-injury. Î§Â² analyses indicated significantly greater variability in the number of intervals recorded as asleep among Ss with self-injury than their matched controls. These results are congruent with previous findings of sleep disturbance among persons with mental retardation and behavior problems. The possibility of neurochemical dysregulation in sleep disturbance among individuals with daytime self-injury is discussed.

1388,Parental magico-religious illness beliefs in an adolescent girl with major depression and systemic lupus erythematosus,"Presents the case report of a 15-year-old girl with major depression, which occurred in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The understanding of her parents' illness beliefs has been of therapeutic support in the psychiatric follow-up. The treatment, with a favorable outcome, consisted of hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. When she was referred to consultation-liaison psychiatry, Ms. A was troubled by feelings of sadness, insomnia, and worthlessness, without suicidal intent. This case illustrates how it is essential to understand patients' own illness experience, especially in immigrants or in immigrants' children, and demonstrates how an understanding of illness beliefs may enhance utilization of Western health care.

1389,Sleep problems as a risk factor for suicide: Are certain specific sleep domains associated with increased suicide risk?,"Evidence from diverse settings and populations indicates that sleep problems are associated with suicidal ideation. However, relationships between them are not well defined. This study was conducted in order to explore whether poor sleep was associated with suicidal ideation above and beyond depression and whether specific domains of sleep were related to suicidal ideation. We also determined whether the association between sleep problems and suicidal ideation was mediated by depression.Materials and Methods: Patients aged 18-65 years from an outpatient clinic at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital were recruited for this study. From September 2010 to November 2017, a total of 909 participants were included in the final sample. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess psychiatric symptoms. Independent samples t-test, chi-square test, Pearson correlation analyses, hierarchical multiple regression analyses, and mediation analyses were performed using SPSS PROCESS macro.Results: The majority of participants with suicidal ideation also had sleep problems (94.9%). After controlling for age, marital status, and depressive symptoms, total sleep problems estimated by the PSQI global score were also significant associated with suicidal ideation. Among seven sleep components derived from the PSQI, several components including cough or snore loudly, have bad dreams, and use sleep medication were associated with increased suicide risk. Also, the relationship between sleep problems and suicidal ideation was mediated by depressive symptoms indirectly. There was no convincing direct relationship between sleep problems and suicidal ideation.Conclusions: Investigating the pathways which connect sleep problems and suicidality is fundamental to the development of suicide prevention. While it might be premature to suggest specific interventions, it would be important for clinicians to consider evaluating and managing sleep problems in the context of suicidality","Tae H; Jeong BR; Chae JH,",1,1389
1390,Matrix analysis and risk management to avert depression and suicide among workers,"Suicide is among the most tragic outcomes of all mental disorders, and the prevalence of suicide has risen dramatically during the last decade, particularly among workers. This paper reviews and proposes strategies to avert suicide and depression with regard to the mind body medicine equation hypothesis, metrics analysis of mental health problems from a public health and clinical medicine view. In occupational fields, the mind body medicine hypothesis has to deal with working environment, working condition, and workersâ€™ health. These three factors chosen in this paper were based on the concept of risk control, called San-kanri, which has traditionally been used in Japanese companies, and the causation concepts of host, agent, and environment. Working environment and working condition were given special focus with regard to tackling suicide problems. Matrix analysis was conducted by dividing the problem of working conditions into nine cells: three prevention levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary) were proposed for each of the three factors of the mind body medicine hypothesis (working environment, working condition, and workersâ€™ health). After using these main strategies (mind body medicine analysis and matrix analysis) to tackle suicide problems, the paper talks about the versatility of case-method teaching, 'Hiyari-Hat activity,' routine inspections by professionals, risk assessment analysis, and mandatory health check-up focusing on sleep and depression. In the risk assessment analysis, an exact assessment model was suggested using a formula based on multiplication of the following three factors: (1) severity, (2) frequency, and (3) possibility. Mental health problems, including suicide, are rather tricky to deal with because they involve evaluation of individual cases. The mind body medicine hypothesis and matrix analysis would be appropriate tactics for suicide prevention because they would help the evaluation of this issue as a tangible problem.

1391,"Mental health, suicidal ideation, and related factors among workers from medium-sized business establishments in northern Japan: comparative study of sex differences","A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3,233 workers (2,442 males and 791 females) from 17 medium-sized business establishments in northern Japan with respect to GHQ-12 score, suicidal ideation, sociodemographic characteristics, work-associated factors, and attitude toward mental health resources. Sex differences were assessed for each questionnaire item, and logistic regression analyses were performed separately for males and females. Significant correlations between common mental disorder (CMD: GHQ-12 scoreâ‰¥3) and the following factors were found for both sexes: short sleep, irregular working schedule, working in specific businesses, and attitude toward mental health resources. Associations between CMD and excess workload were significant only in male workers. While correlations between suicidal ideation and demand for mental health resources were observed in both sexes, significant correlations were observed between suicidal ideation and use of mental health resources for female workers alone. These results suggest that screening of a high-risk population and provision of mental health resources contribute to suicide prevention as a part of mental health promotion measures in medium-sized business establishments. They also suggest the need for identification of business/job type-specific stressors while considering sex differences in lifestyle factors, working environment, and help-seeking behavior.;Mental Health*, Suicidal Ideation*, Employment/*psychology, Adolescent, Adult, Female, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Sex Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Work Schedule Tolerance/psychology, Young Adult","Takusari, Eri; Suzuki, Mitsuru; Nakamura, Hikaru & Otsuka, Kotaro",1,1391
1392,The contribution of psychological distress to socio-economic differences in cause-specific mortality: a population-based follow-up of 28 years,"Background: Psychological factors associated with low social status have been proposed as one possible explanation for the socio-economic gradient in health. The aim of this study is to explore whether different indicators of psychological distress contribute to socio-economic differences in cause-specific mortality.; Methods: The data source is a nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional survey, Health Behaviour and Health among the Finnish Adult Population"" (AVTK). The survey results were linked with socio-economic register data from Statistics Finland (from the years 1979-2002) and mortality follow-up data up to 2006 from the Finnish National Cause of Death Register. The data included 32451 men and 35420 women (response rate 73.5%). Self-reported measures of depression insomnia and stress were used as indicators of psychological distress. Socio-economic factors included education employment status and household income. Mortality data consisted of unnatural causes of death (suicide accidents and violence and alcohol-related mortality) and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox regression model.; Results: In unnatural mortality psychological distress accounted for some of the employment status (11-31%) and income level (4-16%) differences among both men and women and for the differences related to the educational level (5-12%) among men; the educational level was associated statistically significantly with unnatural mortality only among men. Psychological distress had minor or no contribution to socio-economic differences in CHD mortality.; Conclusions: Psychological distress partly accounted for socio-economic disparities in unnatural mortality. Further studies are needed to explore the role and mechanisms of psychological distress associated with socio-economic differences in cause-specific mortality.;""Accession Number: 21356041.

1393,"Suicidal drug overdose in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, a nationwide population-based case-control study","Objective: A four-fold increase of suicide mortality has been demonstrated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Prior studies showed that the most common method of suicide attempts in SLE patients involves drug overdose. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based case-control study to elucidate factors associated with drug overdose as suicide attempt in SLE patients.; Methods: This study was based on the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We identified all SLE patients from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. Patients who had suicidal drug overdose (SDO) were selected as cases while age- and gender-matched patients who did not have SDO were selected as controls.; Results: The incidence rate of SDO in SLE patients was 291 cases per 100,000 person-years, higher than that in the general population (160 cases per 100,000 person-years). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we observed that SDO was associated with psychiatric disorders such as depressive disorders (odds ratio: 8.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.60-12.48) and insomnia (odds ratio: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.73-4.25), and lower monthly income (odds ratios: 2.74 to 3.50) in SLE patients.; Conclusion: SDO is associated with psychiatric disorders such as depressive disorders and insomnia, and lower monthly income in SLE patients.; Â© The Author(s) 2015.Drug Overdose/*epidemiology, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*epidemiology, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Case-Control Studies, Depressive Disorder/epidemiology, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Drug Overdose/mortality, Female, Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Poverty/psychology, Risk Assessment, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology, Taiwan/epidemiology, Epidemiology, overdose, poisoning, suicide, systematic lupus erythematosus","Tang, K.

1394,"Suicidality in chronic pain: A review of the prevalence, risk factors and psychological links","Background: This paper reviews and integrates the growing literature concerning the prevalence of and risk factors for suicidality in chronic pain. Method: A series of systematic searches in MEDLINE and PsychINFO identified 12 relevant articles examining suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation in chronic pain. A selection of theoretical and empirical work identifying psychological processes that have been implicated in both the pain and suicide literature and which may be related to increased suicidality was also reviewed. Results: Relative to controls, risk of death by suicide appeared to be at least doubled in chronic pain patients. The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was between 5% and 14% in individuals with chronic pain, with the prevalence of suicidal ideation being âˆ¼ 20 %. Eight risk factors for suicidality in chronic pain were identified, including the type, intensity and duration of pain and sleep-onset insomnia co-occurring with pain, which appeared to be pain-specific. Helplessness and hopelessness about pain, the desire for escape from pain, pain catastrophizing and avoidance, and problem-solving deficits were highlighted as psychological processes relevant to the understanding of suicidality in chronic pain. Conclusions: Programmatic research is urgently required to investigate the role of both general and pain-specific risk factors for suicidality, to examine how the psychological processes mentioned above mediate or exacerbate suicidality, and to develop enhanced interventions for pain patients at risk.

Insomnia symptoms were evaluated with a standard insomnia questionnaire. The association between insomnia symptoms and SI was examined and adjusted for potential confounders, including age, sex, marital status, previous stroke, depression, fatigue, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and neurologic deficits measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.; Results: Eighty-seven patients (11.1%) were found to have SI (SI group). Frequent awakening was significantly more common in the SI group than in the non-SI group and remained a significant predictor of SI in forward logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 1.7) after adjusting for possible confounders.; Conclusions: These findings should alert clinicians to the potential danger of insomnia and the importance of its early identification and treatment in stroke patients.; Copyright Â© 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

1396,The relationship between the frequency of suicidal ideation and sleep disturbance factors among adolescent earthquake victims in China,"Objective: This study aimed to examine the frequency of suicidal ideation (SI) and identify exposure variables, mental health, and sleep-related risk factors of SI among adolescents following the 2013 Ya'an earthquake.; Methods: Participants consisted of 5563 adolescent students selected through random sampling from 11 primary and high schools in the counties most severely affected by the earthquake. They were asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale-13, Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, and Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders. Multinomial logistic analysis was used to identify possible relationships between SI and psychopathology, sleep problems, earthquake exposures or demographic characteristics. The mediation analysis was used to identify direct and indirect effects among sleep problems, psychopathology, earthquake exposures and SI.; Results: Our findings suggest that 29.5% of the sample experienced SI during the past year (12.9% once, 11.9% twice, 2.6% on 3-4 occasions and 2.1% on at least 5 occasions). Multiple sleeping problems, including trouble falling asleep, shorter sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction, showed independent associations with SI. The mediation analysis suggested that depression and anxiety mainly mediated the association of sleep with SI.; Limitations: This study was cross-sectional and did not include controls. No baseline data were collected prior to the earthquake.; Conclusion: SI can be a serious problem among adolescents following a major earthquake, especially those who are older, who live in one-child households, or who are female. Years after a disaster, we found that exposure severity, psychopathology and sleep impairment all contributed to SI, and that earthquake exposure may have disrupted sleep and worsened mood, which in turn may have impacted SI. By enhancing teenagers' sleep management and shaping their activities, post-disaster intervention programs may help prevent SI among Chinese adolescents.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

1397,Does Eating Vegetables at Start of Meal Prevent Childhood Overweight in Japan? A-CHILD Study,"Background: Because eating behaviors are established early in life, it is important to instill healthy eating habits in children. However, no published studies have examined the effects of what is habitually consumed first at a meal on children's body weight in real settings. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between what was consumed (vegetables, rice/bread, meat/fish, or soup) at the start of a meal and childhood overweight in Japan. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study, a population-based study comprising all first-grade students in Adachi City, Tokyo, Japan, performed in 2015. Through a questionnaire, we identified what types of food children ate first at meals. The questionnaire was completed by 4,040 caregivers. We used corresponding school health check-up data (height and weight) to assess overweight in each child. Results: The proportions of what was consumed first at a meal were 11.6, 23.3, 25.4, 9.8, and 29.9% for vegetables, meat/fish, rice/bread, soup, and undetermined (variable), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed the odds ratio of being overweight was 1.83 in children who ate meat/fish first (95% CI: 1.27-2.64, p < 0.01) compared with children who ate vegetables first. In contrast, the odds ratios in children who consumed rice/bread or soup first compared with children who ate vegetables first were 1.11 (95% CI: 0.76-1.61, p = 0.59) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.83-2.01, p = 0.26), respectively. Conclusion: Children who eat meat/fish at the start of a meal are more likely to be overweight than those who eat vegetables at the start of a meal. Future studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of how the order in which food is consumed at a meal affects weight status in children.; behavioral economics, childhood obesity, eating behavior, food sequencing, order of food consumed","Tani, Yukako; Fujiwara, Takeo; Ochi, Manami; Isumi, Aya & Kato, Tsuguhiko",0,1397
1398,Nightmares as predictors of suicide,"Examined the relationship between the frequency of nightmares and the risk of suicide. A prospective follow-up study in a general population of Finland starting in 1972. A total of 36,211 Ss (17,700 men and 18,511 women aged 25-64 yrs at baseline. The study included self-administered questionnaire (mainly questions on socioeconomic factors, medical history, health behavior, and psychosocial factors) and health examination at the local primary healthcare center. The frequency of nightmares was estimated. The Ss were followed until Dec. 31, 1995, or death. Information on deaths caused by suicide or other self-inflicted injury was obtained from the National Death Register by computerized record linkage using the national personal identification code assigned to every Finnish resident. Using the Cox proportional hazards regression model we controlled for several potential confounding factors. The frequency of nightmares was directly related to the risk of suicide. Among Ss having nightmares occasionally the adjusted relative risk of suicide was 57% higher, and among those reporting frequent nightmares 105% higher compared with Ss reporting no nightmares at all.

1399,Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder,"Presents a case of a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. Sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. Both serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were extremely low, whereas aldosterone was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. Thus, this case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

1400,Developmental comorbidity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"With the present review, we intend to highlight the importance of considering the age- and development-dependent occurrence of comorbidity in ADHD and to outline distinct trajectories of symptom progression with possible impact on course and outcome of ADHD. The review will focus on introducing the concepts of developmental epidemiology"" and ""developmental comorbidity"". Psychiatric and non-psychiatric age-dependent comorbidity can be seen in the majority of children adolescents and adults with ADHD resulting in a severe impairment of everyday life with considerable functional and psychosocial problems. Concerning the temporal order of occurrence psychiatric conditions may be present before the appearance of first definite ADHD symptoms (""pre-comorbidity"" such as temperament factors sleep disturbance autism spectrum disorders and atopic eczema). They may coincide with the time when ADHD symptoms reach a clinically significant level (""simultaneous comorbidity"": enuresis encopresis developmental dyslexia). The majority of comorbidity however appears after the onset of ADHD in the course of disease (""post-comorbidity"": tic disorder depression and suicidality anxiety disorders obsessive compulsive disorder bipolar disorder conduct and substance use disorders obesity and personality disorders). The aetio-pathophysiology of ADHD and its comorbid disorders and also the nature of comorbidity itself being highly heterogeneous we additionally discuss possible models of comorbidity. In the future longitudinal data on distinct patterns of symptom and comorbidity progression would help to refine disease classification systems strengthen the power of future genetic studies and finally allow for more specific treatment strategies.;""Accession Number: 21432612.

1401,A meta-synthesis of research on leg ulceration and neuropathic pain component and sequelae,"Leg ulceration represents a substantial health problem, and pain is likely to be an associated symptom. The aim of this meta-synthesis was to undertake a systematic review of qualitative studies investigating the experience of chronic painful leg ulceration. This study undertook the meta-synthesis approach described by Sandelowski and Barroso (2003), which is a synthesis and re-interpretation of the findings from several qualitative studies. Findings were extracted and synthesized. The overarching theme was that patients with chronic leg ulceration suffer from persistent pain with associated sequelae. Word descriptors used by participants also suggested that patients have neuropathic pain. In addition, findings from the meta-synthesis suggested that pain associated with chronic leg ulcer may have a neuropathic pain component. Pain associated with leg ulceration is likely to have nociceptive properties as well as neuropathic properties. If neuropathic pain is not identified and managed effectively, patients are at risk of developing a chronic pain condition with associated sequelae, such as poor sleep, depression and suicidal ideation. It is proposed that early identification and management may enable appropriate pain management which may prevent or reduce the associated risks.;Leg Ulcer*/epidemiology, Leg Ulcer*/nursing, Leg Ulcer*/psychology, Neuralgia*/epidemiology, Neuralgia*/nursing, Neuralgia*/psychology, Depression/*epidemiology, Sleep Wake Disorders/*epidemiology, Chronic Disease, Humans, Risk Factors","Taverner, Tarnia; Closs, JosÃ© & Briggs, Michelle",0,1401
1402,Insomnia as a Health Risk Factor,"This article reviewed insomnia epidemiological research, identifying areas where insomnia was a risk factor and isolating areas deserving of further investigation. Insomnia was consistently predictive of depression, anxiety disorders, other psychological disorders, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, and suicide, indicating insomnia is a risk factor for these difficulties. Additionally, insomnia was related to decreased immune functioning. The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed. The main weaknesses were inadequate definition of insomnia and inadequate control for alternative explanations. Despite these limitations, this review suggests that insomnia is a risk factor for poor mental and physical health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1403,Antidepressant drugs and the emergence of suicidal tendencies,"Although antidepressant medications represent the cornerstone of treatment for patients with moderate to severe clinical depression, they also carry serious risks. There is evidence which suggests that antidepressants can, in rare instances, induce or exacerbate suicidal tendencies. Nine clinical mechanisms have been proposed through which this may occur. These are: (a) energizing depressed patients to act on pre-existing suicidal ideation; (b) paradoxically worsening depression; (c) inducing akathisia with associated self-destructive or aggressive impulses; (d) inducing panic attacks; (e) switching patients into manic or mixed states; (f) producing severe insomnia or interfering with sleep architecture; (g) inducing an organic obsessional state; (h) producing an organic personality disorder with borderline features; and (i) exacerbating or inducing electroencephalogram (EEG) or other neurological disturbances. Epidemiological and controlled studies also provide data on the association between antidepressant drugs and suicidal ideation, attempts and fatalities. These include studies which: (a) suggest that electroconvulsive therapy may be more effective than antidepressant drugs in reducing the frequency of suicide attempts; (b) indicate that antidepressants may differ in their capacity to reduce the frequency of suicide attempts; (c) find that more overdose attempts were made by patients receiving maprotiline than placebo; and (d) suggest that fluoxetine may be associated with a greater risk of inducing de novo suicidal ideation. Evidence suggests that antidepressants may vary by at least 15-fold in the number of fatal overdoses per million prescriptions. Estimated overdose proclivity rates were derived after adjusting the fatal toxicity data by the therapeutic index of the drug. These rates were very consistent between agents with the same pharmacological properties, and correlated well with known overdose risk rates for amitriptyline, mianserin and maprotiline. Estimated overdose proclivity rates suggest that the highly selective noradrenaline (norepinephrine) uptake inhibitors (desipramine, nortriptyline, maprotiline) may be associated with a greater risk for overdose than more mixed uptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Antidepressants are not uniformly neutral in regard to suicidal ideation and attempts. Data clearly demonstrate that antidepressants ameliorate suicidal ideation more effectively than placebo in patients with depression. Although antidepressants diminish suicidal ideation in many recipients, about as many patients experience worsening suicidal ideation on active medication as they do on placebo. Furthermore, at least as many patients attempted suicide on fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants as on placebo, and more patients attempted to overdose on maprotiline than placebo. These observations suggest that antidepressants may redistribute suicide risk, attenuating risk in some patients who respond well, while possible enhancing risk in others who respond more poorly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS);Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Suicide/*psychology, Depressive Disorder/complications, Drug Overdose, Electroencephalography/drug effects, Humans, Suicide/statistics & numerical data","Teicher, M H; Glod, C A & Cole, J O",0,1403

Suicidal ideation was assessed by item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and comorbid conditions were examined as potential correlates. Depression was measured by the PHQ-8 score (range 1-24). We used random forests to identify subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation. To determine if any correlates were unique to arthritis, we compared results to those for persons with diabetes mellitus and cancer.; Results: The prevalence Â± SEM of suicidal ideation was 5.6% Â± 0.8% among persons with arthritis and 2.4% Â± 0.4% among those without. The most important correlates for suicidal ideation in adults with arthritis were depression, anxiety, duration of arthritis, age, income:poverty ratio, number of close friends, pain, alcohol, excessive daytime sleepiness, and comorbidities. Eleven of the 16 most important contributors for suicidal ideation among adults with arthritis were also important for people with diabetes mellitus and cancer. Among persons with arthritis, subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation were those with a PHQ-8 score between 18 and 24 and less than 4.5 years of arthritis (96.5%), and those with a PHQ-8 score between 7 and 17, â‰¥1.24 days of binges/month, and either an income of â‰¥$45,000/year (85.4%) or an income of <$45,000/year and >3 comorbidities (70.8%).; Conclusion: Depression, short duration of arthritis, binge drinking, income, and >3 comorbidities identified subgroups of adults with arthritis at greatest risk for suicidal ideation.; Copyright Â© 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.Suicidal Ideation*, Arthritis/*epidemiology, Arthritis/*psychology, Aged, Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology, Alcohol Drinking/psychology, Comorbidity, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depression/epidemiology, Depression/psychology, Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology, Diabetes Mellitus/psychology, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Income, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasms/epidemiology, Neoplasms/psychology, Prevalence, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Time Factors, United States","Tektonidou, Maria G.; Dasgupta, Abhijit & Ward, Michael M.",0,1404
1405,Predictors of response and nonresponse to light treatment for winter depression,"The authors' goal was to determine whether the pattern and severity of depressive symptoms predict response to light treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). 103 Ss with winter depression were given bright light treatment. 71 were classified as responders, 15 as nonresponders, and 17 as partial responders. Using depression rating scale data and correlational and multivariate analysis, the authors sought predictors of response in baseline symptom and scale scores. Responders were characterized by atypical symptoms, especially hypersomnia, afternoon or evening slump, reverse diurnal variation (evenings worse), and carbohydrate craving. By contrast, nonresponders were characterized mainly by melancholic symptoms: retardation, suicidality, depersonalization, typical diurnal variation (mornings worse), anxiety, early and late insomnia, appetite loss, and guilt. The ratio of atypical to classical symptoms of depression, rather than severity per se, best predicted treatment outcome for the group as a whole. It is concluded that light-responsive seasonal affective disorder is distinguished by a dominant atypical symptom profile closely associated with depressed mood. Nonresponders form a clinically distinct group with melancholic features.

1406,Adolescent Health Risk and Behavior Survey: A School Based Survey in Central Nepal,"Background A comprehensive study of adolescent health risk specific to the Dhulikhel catchment area has not been performed. Objective This survey assesses trends in demographics, nutrition, hygiene and related infrastructure, causes of injury, violence, mental health, substance abuse, and menstrual hygiene. Method A 40 question survey was adapted from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, translated into the Nepali language, and administered to 1200 students in eight different schools in central Nepal. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Result The data has identified nutrition, infrastructure, mental health, and menstrual hygiene as areas for improvement. The number of adolescents who reported going hungry some, most, or all of the time (30.5%, 25.8%, 13.9%) reveals a need for better food access. Approximately 44.5 % of students had no access to soap and water at school. Students who endorse dissatisfaction with themselves was 6.5% and those with suicidal ideation or attempt was 11.8% of the surveyed population. A significantly greater percentage of students who reported suicidal ideation also reported engaging in behaviors related to physical violence, substance abuse, being dissatisfaction with themselves, insomnia due to anxiety, and loneliness. Of the female students, 40.1% reported missing school at least once in the last three months due to their period. Conclusion This data shows a need for better food access, improved infrastructure in schools in central Nepal, and the need to address the prevalence of mental health issues through program interventions.; Adolescent Behavior*, Adolescent Health*, Risk-Taking*, Adolescent, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Health, Nepal, Prevalence, Schools/standards, Students/psychology, Suicidal Ideation, Surveys and Questionnaires, Violence/statistics & numerical data","Thapa, B; Powell, J; Yi, J; McGee, J; Landis, J; Rein, L; Kim, S; Shrestha, S & Karmacharya, B",1,1406

1409,Hospital care for mental health and substance abuse in children with epilepsy,"Background: Reducing the burden of pediatric mental illness requires greater knowledge of mental health and substance abuse (MHSA) outcomes in children who are at an increased risk of primary psychiatric illness. National data on hospital care for psychiatric illness in children with epilepsy are limited. Methods: We used the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality from 2003 to 2009 to examine MHSA hospitalization patterns in children with comorbid epilepsy. Nonparametric and regression analyses determined the association of comorbid epilepsy with specific MHSA diagnoses and examined the impact of epilepsy on length of stay (LOS) for such MHSA diagnoses while controlling for demographic, payer, and hospital characteristics. Results: We observed 353,319 weighted MHSA hospitalizations of children ages 6â€“20; 3280 of these involved a child with epilepsy. Depression was the most common MHSA diagnosis in the general population (39.5%) whereas bipolar disorder was the most common MHSA diagnosis among children with epilepsy (36.2%). Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that children with comorbid epilepsy had greater adjusted odds of bipolar disorder (AOR: 1.17, 1.04â€“1.30), psychosis (AOR: 1.78, 1.51â€“2.09), sleep disorder (AOR: 5.90, 1.90â€“18.34), and suicide attempt/ideation (AOR: 3.20, 1.46â€“6.99) compared to the general MHSA inpatient population. Epilepsy was associated with a greater LOS and a higher adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for prolonged LOS (IRR: 1.12, 1.09â€“1.17), particularly for suicide attempt/ideation (IRR: 3.74, 1.68â€“8.34). Conclusions: Children with epilepsy have distinct patterns of hospital care for mental illness and substance abuse and experience prolonged hospitalization for MHSA conditions. Strategies to reduce psychiatric hospitalizations in this population may require disease-specific approaches and should measure disease-relevant outcomes. Hospitals caring for large numbers of children with neurological disease (such as academic centers) may have inaccurate measurements of mental health-care quality unless the impact of key comorbid conditions such as epilepsy is considered.

In medical school, the total disorder group had significantly more nervous tension, anxiety, and anger under stress, had more insomnia, smoked more cigarettes, and took alcoholic drinks more frequently. Individual disorder group means were significantly different from each other. The mental illness group showed the most nervous tension, depression, and anger under stress and the malignant tumor group the least. The malignant tumor group resembled the healthy control group in these respects. The suicide, mental illness, and malignant tumor groups had low mean scores for closeness to parents, while the hypertension and coronary occlusion group means were slightly higher than the control group mean. Thus psychologic differences in youth have predictive potential in regard to premature disease and death.;Attitude*, Family*, Morbidity*, Mortality*, Personality*, Adult, Disease Susceptibility, Family Characteristics, Female, Humans, Male, Probability, Prospective Studies, Stress, Psychological","Thomas, C B",0,1410
1411,Risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with varenicline: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: To determine the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with use of varenicline compared with placebo in randomised controlled trials.; Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing study effects using two summary estimates in fixed effects models, risk differences, and Peto odds ratios.; Data Sources: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and clinicaltrials.gov.; Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies: Randomised controlled trials with a placebo comparison group that reported on neuropsychiatric adverse events (depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, suicide, insomnia, sleep disorders, abnormal dreams, somnolence, fatigue, anxiety) and death. Studies that did not involve human participants, did not use the maximum recommended dose of varenicline (1 mg twice daily), and were cross over trials were excluded.; Results: In the 39 randomised controlled trials (10,761 participants), there was no evidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide (odds ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 8.57), suicidal ideation (0.58, 0.28 to 1.20), depression (0.96, 0.75 to 1.22), irritability (0.98, 0.81 to 1.17), aggression (0.91, 0.52 to 1.59), or death (1.05, 0.47 to 2.38) in the varenicline users compared with placebo users. Varenicline was associated with an increased risk of sleep disorders (1.63, 1.29 to 2.07), insomnia (1.56, 1.36 to 1.78), abnormal dreams (2.38, 2.05 to 2.77), and fatigue (1.28, 1.06 to 1.55) but a reduced risk of anxiety (0.75, 0.61 to 0.93). Similar findings were observed when risk differences were reported. There was no evidence for a variation in depression and suicidal ideation by age group, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, presence or absence of psychiatric illness, and type of study sponsor (that is, pharmaceutical industry or other).; Conclusions: This meta-analysis found no evidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide, suicidal ideation, depression, or death with varenicline. These findings provide some reassurance for users and prescribers regarding the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. There was evidence that varenicline was associated with a higher risk of sleep problems such as insomnia and abnormal dreams.

1412,Toward early identification of sensory over-responsivity (SOR): A construct for predicting difficulties with sleep and feeding in infants,"Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) is a type of sensory modulation disorder in which heightened sensitivity to non-noxious sensations interrupts daily life. In this preliminary study within a larger investigation, we used infants with sleep/feeding difficulties as a proxy for later development of SOR. We tested evidence for construct validity and internal reliability of pre- and perinatal factors that, together, could predict infant sleep/feeding difficulties. We obtained retrospective data on 360 mother-infant dyads on 38 pre- and perinatal variables and linked the data with infant referral for sleep/feeding difficulties. We analyzed the data with Rasch analysis to examine evidence for a unidimensional construct. Our results show good evidence for a construct comprising 18 of the 38 pre- and perinatal variables examined. This construct may represent a step toward early identification of SOR and provide therapists with evidence to support the use of pre- and perinatal information as predictors of infant sleep/feeding difficulties.

1413,The prediction of studyemergent suicidal ideation in bipolar disorder: A pilot study using ecological momentary assessment data,"Objectives: Bipolar disorder is associated with idiosyncratic precursors of clinically important states such as suicidal ideation. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) - high frequency data collection in a subject's usual environment - provides the potential for development of temporal, individualized prediction of risk states. The present study tested the ability of EMA data to predict individual symptom change in clinicianâ€rated suicidal ideation. Methods: Thirtyâ€five adults diagnosed with interâ€episode bipolar disorder completed daily measures of affect in their home environments using diaries administered over an eightâ€week assessment timeline. Suicidal ideation was assessed monthly at inâ€person visits using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Rated. We used a novel application of functional linear models (FLMs) to generate prospective predictions of suicidal ideation at inâ€person clinician assessments based on intensively sampled trajectories of daily affect. Results: Eight instances of suicidal ideation scores > 0 were recorded during the study period on six participants. Utilizing trajectories of negative and positive affect, crossâ€validated predictions attained 88% sensitivity with 95% specificity for elevated suicidal ideation one week prior to inâ€person clinician assessment. This model strongly outperformed prediction models using crossâ€sectional data obtained at study visits alone. Conclusions: Utilizing EMA data with FLM prediction models substantially increases the accuracy of prediction of studyâ€emergent suicidal ideation. Prediction algorithms employing intensively sampled longitudinal EMA data could sensitively detect the warning signs of suicidal ideation to facilitate improved suicide risk assessment and the timely delivery of preventative interventions.

1414,What role do nightmares play in suicide? A brief exploration,"The suicide rate in the United States has climbed each year for more than a decade, highlighting the need for greater understanding of, and prevention strategies for suicidal behavior. Nightmares have been shown to be associated with suicidal behavior independent of several psychiatric risk factors for suicide, such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The specific role of nightmares in contributing to suicide remains unclear due to the difficulty in delineating causal factors. However, the reporting, screening and treatment of nightmares continues to remain rare making progress difficult. Research is beginning to make some progress in uncovering the mechanisms by which nightmares increase suicide risk providing opportunities for intervention and prediction of suicidal behaviors.

1415,Parental reporting of adverse drug reactions associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications in children attending specialist paediatric clinics in the UK,"Background: The development of systems to ensure appropriate and informed use of medicines in children is a global priority. Current pharmacovigilance systems, such as the UK Yellow Card Scheme, are limited by opportunistic reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), lack of a denominator and lower than expected reporting rates.; Objective: To develop a pharmacovigilance system able to target specific patient populations such as children, and specific medicines of interest, using specialist medical clinics.; Methods: Between January and March 2010, parents of 578 children (3-16 years of age) receiving pharmacological therapy for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and attending a child and adolescent clinic in the UK were sent an ADR questionnaire to elicit information on possible ADRs associated with their child's medication use. Two approaches, free text and a symptom tick list, were used to elicit possible ADRs.; Results: Two hundred and seven questionnaires were returned, of which 200 were evaluable, giving a response rate of 35.9%. 123 questionnaires reported a total of 213 free-text ADRs perceived by the parents to be due to the medications under study. Two-thirds of reported ADRs were considered to be ongoing at the time of reporting. Duration of reported ADRs ranged from 1 week to 3 years. 81 returned questionnaires reported 134 different ADRs for methylphenidate monotherapy. For methylphenidate, the most frequently reported ADRs were loss of appetite (34.3%), headache (17.9%), mood and emotional problems (14.9%), stomach upset (14.9%), sleep disturbance (10.4%), and rash and other skin problems (5.2%). 467 possible drug-related symptoms were reported using the tick-list approach. Using the tick list, the most frequently reported symptoms were mood and emotional problems (28.1% [131/467]), stomach and abdominal problems (13.3% [62/467]), insomnia (12.8% [60/467]) and lack of appetite (12.6% [59/467]). The symptom tick list identified a broader range of possible adverse effects not reported as free-text ADRs, such as schooling difficulties, hearing problems, cough and blurred vision.; Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using specialist clinics to target both at-risk patient populations and/or medicines of interest. We have also clearly demonstrated the practicality and feasibility of parental reporting.

In postmarketing surveillance, neuropsychiatric symptoms have appeared; however, their incidence and causal relationship to varenicline is not known.; Objective: We assessed the incidence and relative risk (RR) of psychiatric disorders in ten randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of varenicline for smoking cessation.; Methods: All smoking cessation phase II, III and IV randomized controlled clinical trials of varenicline versus placebo completed as of 31 December 2008, on file with the manufacturer (Pfizer, Inc.), were included. All studies have been published. All 3091 participants who received at least one dose of varenicline and all 2005 participants who received placebo were included in this analysis. These were men and women smoking > or =10 cigarettes/day, aged 18-75 years and without current psychiatric disease who received varenicline or placebo for 6 (one study), 12 (eight studies) or 52 (one study) weeks. Adverse events were recorded at each study visit and classified according to standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms (version 11.0).; Results: The incidence of psychiatric disorders other than solely sleep disorders and disturbances was 10.7% in subjects treated with varenicline and 9.7% in subjects treated with placebo, with an RR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.86, 1.22). The RRs (95% CI) versus placebo of psychiatric adverse events with an incidence > or =1% in the varenicline group were 0.86 (0.67, 1.12) for anxiety disorders and symptoms, 0.76 (0.42, 1.39) for changes in physical activity, 1.42 (0.96, 2.08) for depressed mood disorders and disturbances, 1.21 (0.79, 1.83) for mood disorders and disturbances not elsewhere classified and 1.70 (1.50, 1.92) for sleep disorders and disturbances. There were no cases of suicidal ideation or behaviour in varenicline-treated subjects in the ten placebo-controlled studies analysed. However, among three trials that were excluded from the analysis because of their open-label design, two cases of suicidal ideation and one completed suicide were reported in patients who had been treated with varenicline. With the exception of sleep disorders and disturbances, there was no evidence of dose-responsivity.; Conclusions: There was no significant increase in overall psychiatric disorders, other than sleep disorders and disturbances, in varenicline-treated subjects in this sample of smokers without current psychiatric disorders.

The neuropeptides were compared with the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in CSF and with postdexamethasone plasma cortisol. Strong correlations were found between CRH and the peptides SOM and beta-END. Patients with major depressive disorders had significantly lower SOM, CRH, and DSIP than other patients. Both SOM and beta-END corelated negatively with postdexamethasone plasma cortisol in all patients. Patients who had made previous suicide attempts had significantly lower CRH than those who had not.

1419,Prevalence and outcome of partial remission in depression,"The goal of treatment of major depression should be full remission. Many patients, however, fail to achieve or maintain symptom-free status. Residual depressive symptoms are common, even where there has been a robust response to antidepressant therapy. In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full remission, one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3-6 times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission. Residual symptoms are also associated with more medical and psychiatric visits, increased public assistance, disability benefits, thoughts of and attempts at suicide and chronicity. The risk of stroke and coronary events is also higher in patients with residual depressive symptoms. The substantial proportion of patients who achieve only partial remission has traditionally been neglected in antidepressant trials. Given that residual symptoms may relate, in part, to an incompatibility between patient and treatment, further research is needed to predict a better match. These symptoms are a clinically relevant state of illness, and the correct choice of initial antidepressant treatment should offer the greatest chance of achieving full remission.;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy, Depressive Disorder, Major/*epidemiology, Adult, Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis, Female, Humans, Male, Prevalence, Remission Induction, Treatment Outcome","Tranter, Richard; O'Donovan, Claire; Chandarana, Praful & Kennedy, Sidney",0,1419
1420,Suicidality in chronic pain: Predictors of suicidal ideation in Fibromyalgia,"Objectives: Fibromyalgia (FM) has been associated with a higher prevalence of suicidal behavior. Nevertheless, much remains unknown about suicide risk factors for this chronic pain disorder. In the present study, the relationship of suicidal ideation in FM with a number of sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological variables was analyzed. Methods: One hundred seventeen women with Fibromyalgia were assessed. The procedure included the exploration of sleep problems (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), health-related quality of life (SF-36 and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), the core symptoms of FM (visual analogue scales), and algometry of tender points. Suicidal ideation was evaluated by item 9 of the BDI. Patients with presence vs. absence of suicidal ideation were compared in all the variables studied. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation among FM patients was 32.5%. Significant differences between patients with vs. without suicidal ideas emerged mainly for the various indices of depression. Patients with suicidal ideation also reported higher levels of anxiety, more day dysfunction due to sleepiness and more limitations due to emotional and physical problems. Logistic regression analysis revealed that cognitive depression symptoms such as BDI Self-Blame cluster are the more closely related to suicide ideation. Conclusions: The presence of suicidal ideation in FM patients is closely related to comorbid depression, anxiety and to a higher impact of the disease in daily life.

1421,Specific dysphoric symptoms are predicted by early maladaptive schemas,"Early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) are cognitive patterns resulting from unmet core emotional needs in childhood that have been linked to the development of psychopathology. As depression is a multifaceted phenomenon, we hypothesized that specific dysphoric symptoms would be predicted by different EMSs. Four hundred and fifty-six participants completed a measure of EMSs (Young Schema Questionnaire) and reported on the severity of the symptoms of criterion A for major depression in DSM-IV during the occurrence of a dysphoric episode in the previous 12 months. A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate the predictive power of the EMSs for the severity of each specific depressive symptom. When controlling for gender and current levels of depression, specific symptoms were predicted by different EMSs: sadness by Negativity/Pessimism; anhedonia by Failure; self-harm by Emotional Deprivation and Vulnerability to Harm or Illness; worthlessness by Failure and Negativity/Pessimism; psychomotor retardation/restlessness by Vulnerability to Harm or Illness and Entitlement/Grandiosity; and poor concentration by Insufficient Self-Control/Self-Discipline. The more physical symptoms of fatigue, insomnia/hypersomnia, and appetite loss/appetite gain were not predicted by any of the EMSs. Although the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for conclusions about the direction of effects, results suggest that depression is not a unitary phenomenon and provide a possible explanation for previous inconsistent findings.;Adaptation, Psychological*, Depression/*psychology, Adult, Depression/diagnosis, Female, Health Surveys, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Surveys and Questionnaires","Trincas, Roberta; Ottaviani, Cristina; Couyoumdjian, Alessandro; Tenore, Katia; Spitoni, Grazia & Mancini, Francesco",0,1421
1422,Concise Health Risk Tracking Scale: A brief self-report and clinician rating of suicidal risk,"Objective: Monitoring suicidality and risk following initiation of antidepressant treatment is an essential component of clinical care, but few brief, reliable ratings of suicidal ideation and behavior in adults are available. This report evaluates the psychometric properties of a brief self- and clinician-rated measure of factors related to the risk of suicide attempt or completion. Method: Adult outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 240) were enrolled from July 2007 through February 2008 and treated in an 8-week, open-label trial with the clinician's choice of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor at 6 primary care and 9 psychiatric clinical care settings in the National Institute of Mental Health-funded Depression Trials Network. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire and an MDD checklist based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Suicidal ideation and behavior are 1 of 9 symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, reduced concentration or indecisiveness, fatigue or decreased energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness, or excessive guilt). The newly developed Concise Health Risk Tracking (CHRT) scale was administered both as the CHRT Self-Report (CHRT-SR) and Clinician Rating (CHRT-C) scales. Psychometric evaluations were conducted on both scales. Results: The internal consistency (Cronbach Î±) was .77 for the 7-item CHRT-C and .78 for the 7-item CHRT-SR with a consistent factor structure, and 3 independent factors (current suicidal thoughts and plans, perceived lack of social support, and hopelessness) for both versions. Conclusions: The 7-item CHRT-C and the 7-item CHRT-SR have excellent psychometric properties and can be used to monitor suicidal risk in clinical practice and research settings. Whether either scale will predict suicide attempts or completions in actual practice would require a very large prospective study sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

1423,Clinical evidence and potential neurobiological underpinnings of unresolved symptoms of depression,"Objective: Recent data indicate that more than 65% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to achieve remission. This article reviews research on the current understanding and management of residual symptoms, i.e., subthreshold depressive symptoms present after recovery from a major depressive episode.; Data Sources: MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006) was searched using combinations of the following search terms: major depressive disorder, residual symptoms, remission, response, tachyphylaxis, antidepressant, algorithm, treatment, responsiveness, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.; Study Selection: All relevant articles that were published in English and reported original study data related to residual symptoms in MDD were included.; Data Extraction: Studies were examined for data related to the prevalence, presentation, consequences, treatment, and neurobiological underpinnings of residual symptoms associated with MDD.; Data Synthesis: Residual symptoms are common among patients treated for MDD who do not achieve full remission. Incomplete remission is associated with increased risk of relapse, suicide, functional impairment, and higher use of health care resources. Several factors, including downstream"" neurochemical mechanisms and clinical factors such as lack of adherence contribute to the high prevalence of residual symptoms. Various clinical strategies including switching and substitution antidepressant therapies are used to address unresolved depressive symptoms. Individual differences in therapeutic response contribute to inadequate treatment and are linked to numerous clinical and neurobiological factors including noncompliance underdosing intolerance disturbances in neural circuitry and genetic variability in neurotransmitters.; Conclusions: Future research is needed to more precisely characterize residual symptoms and their underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms in order to develop more effective treatment methods.;""Accession Number: 18363453.

1424,Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking scale: a brief self-report and clinician rating of symptoms associated with suicidality,"Objective: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings recommend monitoring negative symptoms associated with the initiation of antidepressant medications as these symptoms may interfere with full recovery and pose safety concerns. There is currently no brief, reliable rating instrument for assessing treatment-emergent, negative symptoms. We evaluated the psychometric properties of 2 versions of the newly developed 17-item Concise Associated Symptom Tracking (CAST) scale, the CAST Clinician Rating (CAST-C) and CAST Self-Rated (CAST-SR), which are brief instruments designed to measure the 5 relevant associated symptom domains (irritability, anxiety, mania, insomnia, and panic).; Method: The study enrolled 265 outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD), from July 2007 through February 2008, into an 8-week, open-label trial with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening questionnaire and an MDD checklist based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Suicidality (suicidal ideation with associated behaviors) is 1 of 9 symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, reduced concentration or indecisiveness, fatigue or decreased energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt). Psychometric evaluations were conducted on both versions of the CAST.; Results: Cronbach Î± was .80 (CAST-C) and .81 (CAST-SR). Factor analysis identified 5 factors for each scale: (1) irritability, (2) anxiety, (3) mania, (4) insomnia, and (5) panic. When the item that cross-loaded on 2 factors was eliminated, the 16-item solution had a better goodness of fit (CAST-C: 0.90 vs 0.87; CAST-SR: 0.88 vs 0.84). Cronbach Î± for the 16-item versions was .77 (CAST-C) and .78 (CAST-SR). The 5 associated CAST symptom domains correlated well with other standard measures of these domains.; Conclusions: The 16-item CAST-C and CAST-SR demonstrated excellent psychometric properties.

1425,Effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia on suicidal ideation in veterans,"Objective: To examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on suicidal ideation among Veterans with insomnia. Design: Longitudinal data collected in the course of an uncontrolled evaluation of a large-scale CBT-I training program. Setting: Outpatient and residential treatment facilities. Participants: Four hundred five Veterans presenting for treatment of insomnia. Interventions: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Measurement and Results: At baseline, 32% of patients, compared with 21% at final assessment, endorsed some level of suicidal ideation [Ï‡Â²(df = 1) = 125; P < 0.001]. After adjusting for demographic variables and baseline insomnia severity, each 7-point decrease in Insomnia Severity Index score achieved during CBT-I treatment was associated with a 65% (odds ratio = 0.35; 95% confidence intervals = 0.24 to 0.52) reduction in odds of suicidal ideation. The effect of change in insomnia severity on change in depression severity was also significant. After controlling for change in depression severity and other variables in the model, the effect of change in insomnia severity on change in suicidal ideation remained significant. Conclusion: This evaluation of the largest dissemination of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in the United States found a clinically meaningful reduction in suicidal ideation among Veterans receiving CBT-I. The mechanisms by which effective treatment of insomnia with CBT-I reduces suicide risk are unknown and warrant investigation. The current results may have significant public health implications for preventing suicide among Veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1426,Psychometrics of the Self-Report Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking Scale (CAST-SR): Results From the STRIDE (CTN-0037) Study,"Objective: The self-report Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking Scale (CAST-SR) was developed to track mania, irritability, anxiety, panic, and insomnia symptoms among depressed outpatients receiving antidepressant medication. Given the overlap between these domains, depression, and stimulant use disorders, we reexamined CAST-SR psychometrics in a novel sample: individuals with stimulant use disorder receiving aerobic exercise or health education interventions.; Methods: Using the subsample of stimulant-dependent (following DSM-IV criteria) individuals prescribed antidepressants (N = 124) from the multisite Stimulant Reduction Intervention Using Dosed Exercise (CTN-0037) trial (total sample N = 302), conducted July 2010 to February 2013, we analyzed CAST-SR data collected at the first assessment after participant's discharge from residential treatment. We also evaluated the convergent/discriminant validity of the CAST-SR with several self-report questionnaires.; Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a 12-item measure composed of 4 factors: irritability, anxiety, panic, and insomnia. This factor structure loaded only in participants prescribed antidepressant medication, not in those who were not prescribed antidepressants. These results replicate the original CAST-SR factor structure, except for the mania factor, which failed to load. Internal consistency was high (Î± = 0.92 for total scale and Î± = 0.78-0.89 for the 4 factors), and convergent validity was established, especially for the insomnia and irritability factors, alongside the total score with depressive symptoms, insomnia, quality of life, suicide risk, and physical health measures.; Conclusions: These results demonstrate the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the CAST-SR in a novel population of only individuals with stimulant use disorders receiving both exercise/health education interventions and antidepressant medication.; Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01141608.; Â© Copyright 2018 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","Trombello, Joseph M.; Killian, Michael O.; Liao, Allen; Sanchez, Katherine; Greer, Tracy L.; Walker, Robrina; Grannemann, Bruce; Rethorst, Chad D.; Carmody, Thomas & Trivedi, Madhukar H.",0,1426
1427,Insecure attachment is an independent correlate of objective sleep disturbances in military veterans,"Background: Sleep disturbances and interpersonal problems are highly prevalent in military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are associated with substantial comorbidities and increased healthcare costs. This study examines the association between interpersonal attachment styles and sleep in a high-risk cohort of military veterans with PTSD symptoms.; Methods: Participants were 49 military veterans (85% male) enrolled in a treatment study of combat-related sleep disturbances. Data were collected at pre-treatment baseline. Attachment anxiety and avoidance, clinical characteristics, and subjective sleep quality were characterised via self-report. Polysomnographic sleep measures were averaged from two nights of in-laboratory sleep studies and included: visually scored duration and continuity, the percentage of stage 3+4 sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) measures of delta and beta power during NREM and REM sleep. Linear regressions evaluated the relationship between attachment styles and sleep with adjustment for demographics, and PTSD and depressive symptoms.; Results: Greater attachment anxiety was associated with reduced percentage of stage 3+4 sleep, (Î²=-0.36, p<0.05) and increased relative beta power during NREM sleep (Î²=0.40, p<0.05). By contrast, greater attachment avoidance was positively associated with delta power during NREM and REM sleep (Î²=0.35 and 0.38, respectively, p<0.05).; Conclusions: These findings suggest specific effects of interpersonal styles on physiological sleep measures. Elucidating both the neurobiological and psychological correlates of PTSD-related sleep disturbances is critical for developing future targeted intervention efforts aimed at reducing the burden of PTSD.; Copyright  Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

1428,Guide to family practitioners for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in children and adolescents,"Childhood and adolescent depression is probably more common in the primary care setting than most physicians realize. Because depression can result in suicide, it must be differentially diagnosed from the more common complaints seen in pediatric and adolescent patients. The cause of depression is usually multifactorial and may include psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, life stress/socioenvironmental, biologic/biochemical, and genetic components. Depending on the patient's age, depression can present as mood disturbances, and eating and sleeping disturbances, as well as somatic complaints. With no laboratory tests currently available to diagnose depression, physicians must rely on the history and physical examination as the best diagnostic tool. To aid family practitioners, the authors present criteria for diagnosing depression from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition along with treatment that includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the best possible outcome.; Family Practice*, Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/*therapy, Adolescent, Age Factors, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Child, Depressive Disorder/etiology, Humans, Psychotherapy, Risk Factors","Troxler, M.

The influence of fractures on the risk of suicidal behavior-related hospital visit was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model.The overall adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of suicidal behavior-related hospital visit was 2.21 in fracture cohort. The aHR declined from 2.90 at the 1-year follow-up to 2.00 after 5 years or more. In fracture patients, the risk of suicidal behavior-related hospital visit was higher at age <35 years, with comorbidities of stroke and sleep disorder. Patients with multiple fractures had a 1.69-fold risk.Fractures are an independent risk factor for suicidal behavior. Individuals aged younger than 35 years, with comorbidities of stroke and sleep disorder, and those who have suffered multiple fractures have elevated risk of suicidal behavior among subjects in the fracture group. Furthermore, this increased risk remained even after 5 years had passed since the fracture incident.; Suicidal Ideation*, Fractures, Bone/*complications, Adult, Cohort Studies, Databases, Factual, Female, Fractures, Bone/psychology, Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, Retrospective Studies, Risk Assessment/methods, Risk Factors, Taiwan","Tsai, Chun-Hao; Cheng, Wan-Ju; Muo, Chih-Hsin & Lin, Tsung-Li",1,1429

He was treated in our psychiatry clinic at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan, with insomnia for 3 years. Mrs K was a 65-year-old women who suffered from encephalitis for years, and was cared for entirely by her husband, Mr K. In the preceding 2 years, Mrs K had frequent admissions as a consequence of encephalitis. In August 2014, Mrs K was hospitalized because of consciousness disturbance. She was in a quad room with two other patients. One afternoon approximately 2 weeks after admission, Mr K came to visit as usual without dispute. Initially, Mr K asked the nursing aide to exit, and closed the curtain. He wrapped Mrs Kâ€™s head in a scarf, and stabbed her in the chest with a knife. Thereafter, Mr K stabbed in his own belly, and lay with Mrs K. They were found 1 h later when their neighbor came to visit. Mrs K was dead despite resuscitation attempts, and Mr K was transferred to our hospital for abdominal trauma. As his physical condition improved, he was referred to our psychiatric ward.

1431,Organophosphate intoxication-related coital-like involuntary movements: report of A case,"The neurologic manifestations of organophosphate intoxication are many, and different pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the different presentations occurring at different stages of the disease process. Movement disorders constitute one of the neurologic manifestations, which may include Parkinsonism or other dyskinetic movements. However, involuntary coital-like movements have not been reported as one of the organophosphate intoxication-related movement disorders. In this case report, we describe a 71-year-old man who developed involuntary coital-like movements about one and a half months after an event of organophosphate intoxication in an attempt to commit suicide. The involuntary movements were to-and-fro pelvic thrusting and back-rocking movements. The patient was able to suppress the involuntary movements for a short period of time, although they usually persisted all day long. The involuntary movements occurred in all postures including standing, sitting and in supine postures, resulting in great embarrassment. These involuntary movements also interfered with the initiation of sleep, although they discontinued while asleep. With clonazepam and piracetam therapy, the involuntary coital-like movements of this patient decreased in amplitude, although remaining to a degree even after one year of follow-up.;Organophosphate Poisoning*, Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/*etiology, Aged, Coitus, Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/therapy, Humans, Male","Tsai, Meng-Han; Tsai, Nai-Wen; Chen, Shu-Fang; Tsai, Hui-Hong; Lu, Cheng-Hsien; Huang, Chi-Ren & Chang, Wen-Neng",0,1431
1432,Sleep apnea may be associated with suicidal ideation in adolescents,"Suicide is a major threat to adolescent health. Sleep problems increase the risk of adolescent suicidal behavior, but the role of sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., sleep apnea) is unclear. We investigated whether sleep apnea had an effect on suicidal ideation that was independent of depression and perceived stress. We examined a series of sleep variables with suicidal ideation in 746 fifth and seventh graders using self-reported questionnaires to assess time in bed, sleep quality, insomnia, and sleep apnea while controlling depression and perceived stress. Overall, 8.8% of students aged 10â€“14 years reported having recent suicidal ideation, and 33% or 3.8%, depending on the screening criteria, reported having suspected sleep apnea. The sleep variables were all associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation, but the magnitude of effects was largely attenuated when depression and perceived stress were included in the models. Suspected sleep apnea using daytime sleepiness as a screening criterion was independently associated with suicidal ideation (odds ratio = 2.25, p < 0.05). Suspected sleep apnea was associated with suicidal ideation that was partly independent of depression and stress, which reveals the pertinence of screening for sleep apnea among school students and designing proper prevention strategies for reducing youth suicidal behavior.

1433,Statin-associated psychiatric adverse events: a case/non-case evaluation of an Italian database of spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting,"Background: The inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase ('statins') are widely prescribed hypolipidaemic drugs, which have been evaluated in several clinical trials involving hundreds of thousands of patients. From a safety perspective, both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance have demonstrated that statins are generally well tolerated, with rare serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that affect mainly muscle, liver and kidney. However, recent interest has been focused on a potential risk of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins, including memory loss, depression, suicidality, aggression and antisocial behaviour. Special attention is currently being paid to the potential for statin-induced sleep disorders.; Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that statins may be associated with psychiatric adverse events using quantitative and qualitative signal analysis.; Methods: The Interregional Group of Pharmacovigilance database holds reports of suspected ADRs submitted since 1988 from eight Italian regions. In the present analysis, only reports ranked at least 'possible', according to WHO causality assessment criteria, were considered. Association between statins and psychiatric events was assessed by the case/non-case methodology, calculating the ADR reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a measure of disproportionality. Cases were defined as patients with at least one reported ADR combined with the system organ class (SOC) 'psychiatric disorders'. The non-cases comprised all patients who did not experience an ADR related to the SOC 'psychiatric disorders'. Index reports comprised all ADR reports involving at least one statin, while all ADR reports not involving statins as suspected drugs were used as controls.; Results: According to selection criteria, 35,314 reports were included in the analysis. A total of 71 psychiatric preferred terms combined with statins were identified in 60 reports. Among them, 14 reports (23.3%) noted a positive rechallenge. Both the unadjusted (0.8; 95% CI 0.6, 1.1) and adjusted ROR (0.7; 95% CI 0.6, 1.0) suggested a lower rate of reports of psychiatric events for statins as a whole class compared with all other drugs, although the difference was not significant. The five most frequently reported psychiatric events combined with statins were insomnia, somnolence, agitation, confusion and hallucination. Only insomnia was reported with higher frequency for statins compared with all other drugs (ROR = 3.3; 95% CI 1.9, 5.7), while confusion was reported with a lower frequency (ROR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.1, 0.9). Amongst statins available in Italy, only simvastatin (ROR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.2, 0.9) showed a significantly lower rate of reports of psychiatric events compared with all other drugs together.; Conclusion: A relatively small number of possible statin-associated psychiatric ADRs have been found in our database. No significant risks for a higher overall reporting of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins were identified in comparison with all other drugs combined. However, statin-associated insomnia resulted in a significant ROR that requires further investigation.;Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data, Behavioral Symptoms/*chemically induced, Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*adverse effects, Mental Disorders/*chemically induced, Age Factors, Humans, Italy/epidemiology, Odds Ratio, Sex Factors","Tuccori, Marco; Lapi, Francesco; Testi, Arianna; Coli, Daniela; Moretti, Ugo; Vannacci, Alfredo; Motola, Domenico; Salvo, Francesco; Rivolta, Alma Lisa; Blandizzi, Corrado; Mugelli, Alessandro & Del Tacca, Mario",0,1433
1434,"Psychiatric disorders, suicidal ideation, and sexually transmitted infections among post-deployment veterans who utilize digital social media for sexual partner seeking","Introduction: Digital social media platforms represent outlets through which individuals may find partners for sexual encounters. Using a sample of US post-deployment military veterans, the current study evaluated the prevalence of digital sex seeking as well as clinical correlates of psychopathology, suicidal ideation, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methods: Using data from a baseline telephone interview and follow-up internet-based survey, we examined the prevalence of sexual partnering via digital social media platforms in a national sample of 283 US combat veterans. Results: Among veterans, 35.5% of men and 8.5% of women reported having used digital social media to meet someone for sex. Individuals who reported having used digital social media to find sexual partners (DSMSP+) as compared to those who did not (DSMSP-) were more likely to be young, male, and in the Marine Corps. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, DSMSP+ status was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 2.26, p = 0.01), insomnia (OR = 1.99, p = 0.02), depression (OR = 1.95, p = 0.03), hypersexuality (OR = 6.16, p < 0.001), suicidal ideation (OR = 3.24, p = 0.04), and treatment for an STI (OR = 1.98, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Among US post-deployment military veterans, DSMSP+ behaviors were prevalent, particularly among men. The association between DSMSP+ behaviors and PTSD, insomnia, depression, hypersexuality, suicidal ideation, and STIs suggest that veterans who engage in DSMSP+ behaviors should be particularly thoroughly screened and evaluated for these psychiatric concerns and counseled on the benefits of safe sexual practices.

1435,Risk factors for late-life suicide: A prospective community-based study,"Despite the fact that people age 65 and older have the highest rates of suicide of any age-group, late-life suicide has a low prevalence, making it difficult to conduct prospective studies. The authors examined risk factors for late-life suicide on the basis of general information collected directly from older subjects participating in a community-based prospective study of aging, the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Demographic variables, presence of a relative or friend to confide in, alcohol use, and sleep quality were assessed at baseline interview. Baseline and follow-up data were used to determine physical, cognitive, and affective functioning, as well as medical status. Of 14,456 people, 21 committed suicide over the 10-year observation period. Depressive symptoms, perceived health status, sleep quality, and absence of a relative or friend to confide in predicted late life suicide. Suicide victims did not have greater alcohol use and did not report more medical illness or physical impairment. This study provided additional information about the context of late-life depression that also contributes to suicidal behavior: poor perceived health, poor sleep quality, and limited presence of a relative or friend to confide in.

1436,The impact of job stress and working conditions on mental health problems among junior house officers A nationwide Norwegian prospective cohort study,"Context: Previous studies have shown that physicians have an increased risk of mental health problems such as depression, suicide and substance abuse.; Objectives: To study the prevalence of mental health problems during the first postgraduate year, and to investigate whether work-related factors in hospital are linked to these, when we control for gender, previous mental health problems, personality traits, stress in medical school and other possible predictors.; Design: Nationwide and prospective postal questionnaire survey.; Setting: University of Oslo.; Subjects: Medical students who answered questionnaires in their graduating semester, and 1 year later when they were junior house officers (n=371).; Results: Mental health problems (needing treatment) during internship were reported by 11%, with no gender difference. Adjusted predictors of mental health problems were: previous mental health problems, (odds ratio (OR)=5.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 15.8); being married/cohabitant (OR=0.2, CI 0.1 to 0.7); the personality trait 'vulnerability' (OR=1.5, CI 1.1 to 2.0); negative life events during internship (OR=2.1, CI 1.2 to 3.5), and job stress as house officer (OR=1.05, CI 1.01 to 1.10). The job stress factor of emotional pressure/demands from patients was most important. Perceived study stress and lack of skills at the end of medical school were univariately related to mental health problems in internship, but not when other variables were adjusted. Gender, weekly working hours and lack of sleep were not linked to having problems.; Conclusion: Job stress is related to mental health problems among young doctors, even when the variables of previous mental health problems and personality traits are controlled for. More support during internship is needed.;Medical Staff, Hospital*, Burnout, Professional/*epidemiology, Mental Disorders/*epidemiology, Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Burnout, Professional/etiology, Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders/etiology, Norway/epidemiology, Prevalence, Prospective Studies","Tyssen, R; Vaglum, P; Gronvold, N T & Ekeberg, O",0,1436
1437,Care of the college student,"There are approximately 20 million students in U.S. colleges and universities. Although this population is characterized as having good health, 600,000 students report some form of disability or some type of medical problem, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, psychiatric disorders, and chronic illnesses, among others. Physicians can enhance youth transition to an adult model of health care; the use of self-care skills checklists is one recommended method to assist with the transition. Stimulant medications are effective for treating adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but physicians should use caution when prescribing stimulants to college students because of the high rates of medication diversion in this population. Depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep problems, and eating disorders are common in college students and can significantly impact performance. Emphasis on immunization of students for influenza, meningococcus, and pertussis is necessary because of the low rates of compliance. Screening and interventions for obesity, tobacco use, and substance abuse are important because of the high prevalence of these problems in college students. Screening for alcohol abuse facilitates identification of students with problem drinking behaviors. Students who are war veterans should be monitored for suicidal ideation and posttraumatic stress disorder. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning students are at risk of harassment and discrimination. Caution should be exercised when prescribing medications to college athletes to avoid violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association eligibility rules.;Transition to Adult Care*/economics, Transition to Adult Care*/organization & administration, Student Health Services/*methods, Students/*psychology, Acute Disease, Adolescent, Chronic Disease, Humans, Insurance Coverage, Insurance, Health, Mental Disorders/diagnosis, Mental Disorders/therapy, Physician-Patient Relations, Student Health Services/economics, Student Health Services/organization & administration, United States, Vaccination, Young Adult","Unwin, Brian K; Goodie, Jeffrey; Reamy, Brian V & Quinlan, Jeffrey",0,1437
1438,Sleep complaints in adolescent depression: One year naturalistic follow-up study,"Background: Sleep complaints are highly prevalent in adolescents suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). The aims of this study were to describe the longitudinal course of sleep complaints, and to assess the association between sleep complaints and clinical outcome in a sample of adolescents with MDD during naturalistic follow-up. Methods: A sample of adolescent outpatients (n = 166; age 13-19 years, 17.5% boys) diagnosed with MDD was followed-up during one year in naturalistic settings. Sleep symptoms and psychiatric symptoms were assessed with interviews and self-report questionnaires. Results: All sleep complaints were less frequent at one-year follow-up compared to baseline. Baseline sleep complaints did not adversely affect clinical outcome at one-year follow-up: severity of the sleep complaints at baseline was associated with a steeper improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicidality/self-harm symptoms, and overall psychosocial functioning over time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that sleep disturbances at baseline do not necessarily lead to poorer clinical outcome during follow-up. Larger longitudinal studies combining both subjective and objective measures of sleep in depressed adolescents are needed to clarify the link between sleep and depression further.

1439,"Nonfatal Suicidal Behaviors in U.S. Army Administrative Records, 2004-2009: Results from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS)","Although the U.S. Army suicide rate is known to have risen sharply over the past decade, information about medically documented, nonfatal suicidal behaviors is far more limited. Here we examine trends and sociodemographic correlates of suicide attempts, suspicious injuries, and suicide ideation among regular Army soldiers.Methods: Data come from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS), which integrates administrative records for all soldiers on active duty during the years 2004 through 2009 (n = 1.66 million).Results: We identified 21,740 unique regular Army soldiers with a nonfatal suicidal event documented at some point during the HADS study period. There were substantial increases in the annual incidence rates of suicide attempts (179-400/100,000 person-years) and suicide ideation (557-830/100,000 person-years), but not suspicious injuries. Using hierarchical classification rules to identify the first instance of each soldier's most severe behavior, we found increased risk of all outcomes among those who were female, non-Hispanic White, never married, lower-ranking enlisted, less educated, and of younger age when entering Army service. These sociodemographic associations significantly differed across outcomes, despite some patterns that appear similar.Conclusion: Results provide a broad overview of nonfatal suicidal trends in the U.S. Army during 2004 through 2009 and demonstrate that integration of multiple administrative data systems enriches analysis of the predictors of such events",Ursano RJ; Kessler RC; Heeringa SG; Cox KL; Naifeh JA; Fullerton CS; Sampson NA; Kao TC; Aliaga PA; Vegella P; Mash HH; Buckley C; Colpe LJ; Schoenbaum M; Stein MB; Army STARRS collaborators,1,1439
1440,"Suicide Attempts in the US Army During the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 2004 to 2009","Importance: The rate of suicide attempts in the US Army increased sharply during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Research on this important health outcome has been hampered by the lack of integration among Army administrative data systems.; Objective: To identify risk factors for suicide attempts among active-duty members of the regular Army from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009.; Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study, as part of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS), used individual-level person-month records from Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems to examine sociodemographic, service-related, and mental health predictors of medically documented suicide attempts among active-duty regular Army soldiers from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009. We analyzed data from 9791 suicide attempters and an equal-probability sample of 183,826 control person-months using a discrete-time survival framework. Data analysis was performed from February 3 through November 12, 2014.; Main Outcomes and Measures: Suicide attempts identified using Department of Defense Suicide Event Report records and diagnostic codes E950 through E958 from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Standardized estimates of suicide attempt risk for sociodemographic, service-related, and mental health predictor variables were constructed from Army personnel and medical records.; Results: Enlisted soldiers accounted for 98.6% of all suicide attempts (9650 attempters; overall rate, 377.0 [95% CI, 369.7-384.7] per 100,000 person-years). In multivariate models, suicide attempts among enlisted soldiers were predicted (data reported as odds ratio [95% CI]) by female sex (2.4 [2.3-2.5]), entering Army service at 25 years or older (1.6 [1.5-1.8]), current age of 29 years or younger (<21 years, 5.6 [5.1-6.2]; 21-24 years, 2.9 [2.6-3.2]; 25-29 years, 1.6 [1.5-1.8]), white race (black, 0.7 [0.6-0.7]; Hispanic, 0.7 [0.7-0.8]; Asian, 0.7 [0.6-0.8]), an educational level of less than high school (2.0 [2.0-2.1]), being in the first 4 years of service (1-2 years, 2.4 [2.2-2.6]; 3-4 years, 1.5 [1.4-1.6]), having never (2.8 [2.6-3.0]) or previously (2.6 [2.4-2.8]) been deployed, and a mental health diagnosis during the previous month (18.2 [17.4-19.1]). Attempts among officers (overall rate, 27.9 per 100,000 person-years) were predicted by female sex (2.8 [2.0-4.1]), entering Army service at 25 years or older (2.0 [1.3-3.1]), current age of 40 years or older (0.5 [0.3-0.8]), and a mental health diagnosis during the previous month (90.2 [59.5-136.7]). Discrete-time hazard models indicated risk among enlisted soldiers was highest in the second month of service (102.7 per 100,000 person-months) and declined substantially as length of service increased (mean during the second year of service, 56.0 per 100,000 person-years; after 4 years of service, 29.4 per 100,000 person-months), whereas risk among officers remained stable (overall mean, 6.1 per 100,000 person-months).; Conclusions and Relevance: Our results represent, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive accounting to date of suicide attempts in the Army.

1441,Cause-specific mortality of patients with severe chronic pain referred to a multidisciplinary pain clinic: a cohort register-linkage study,"Almost 20% of the adult population suffers from chronic pain. Chronic pain may be linked to an elevated mortality; however, results from previous studies are inconsistent. Some studies find similar mortality levels in chronic pain patients and pain-free controls while other studies show elevated mortality levels among chronic pain patients, primarily with respect to cancer, diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems, and suicide. These conflicting results are potentially due to different population samples and different operational definitions of chronic pain. Further research on overall and cause-specific mortality in patients with severe chronic pain is needed to inform clinical practice. The objective of this register-linkage study was to investigate whether patients with severe chronic pain referred to multidisciplinary pain treatment have higher cause-specific mortality rates than the general population. Methods In this register-linkage cohort study, data from 6,142 chronic pain patients (female: n=3,941, male: n=2,201, mean age: 48.2±14.2; range: 16-97 years) attending an interdisciplinary Pain Center in Odense, Denmark from 2005 to 2014 were linked to the Danish Register of Causes of Death. Age and gender standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and compared with those of the general population. Data from the general population was extracted from the Danish Register of Causes of Death, and Causes of death were classified according to national Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Results In all, 276 deaths (women: n=152, men: n=124) were observed among the chronic pain patients, and a six-fold higher overall mortality rate was found [SMR: 6.2 (95% CI: 5.5-7.0)] compared with the general population. Elevated cause-specific mortality rates were noted for chronic patients with respect to cancer and neoplasms [4.7 (95% CI: 3.7-5.9)], diseases of the circulatory system [5.7 (95% CI: 4.3-7.3)], diseases of the respiratory system [8.7 (95% CI: 6.2-11.9)], and suicide [7.3 (95% CI: 2.7-15.9)]. Conclusions The overall mortality rate of patients with severe chronic pain in this study was six-fold higher than the rate of the general population in this region. This was reflected in select specific causes of death (cancer and neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the respiratory system, and suicide). The results are in agreement with previous studies and emphasize the need to understand which factors causally affect this increased mortality allowing for targeted interventions in similar chronic pain populations. Implications Potential reasons for the excess mortality should be adequately addressed by future studies in order to better target this in the management of these patients. The chronic pain population included in this study may have several comorbidities contributing to the increased mortality. To better address these aspects, complete medical profiles are needed in future studies. In addition, implementation of management strategies towards potential risk factors such as poor diet, low levels of physical activity, smoking, and high BMI as well as sleep deprivation and morphine use previously shown associated with having pain may reduce the excess mortality ratio","Vaegter HB; Støten M; Silseth SL; Erlangsen A; Handberg G; Sondergaard S; Stenager E,",1,1441

1443,"A 34-year-old woman with depression, suicidal ideation","Presents a case report of a 34-year-old, single, unemployed, Hispanic female with a previous history of Bipolar I disorder diagnosed for 8 years, as well as issues with long-term cocaine and alcohol dependence. She began a residential drug rehabilitation program 2 weeks before presenting for her intake interview at our outpatient clinic. She presented to the clinic with complaints of having depressed mood and decreased energy levels of 1-week duration. The patient also reported having crying spells, decreased sleep with early morning insomnia, and decreased appetite without recent weight loss. She reported no psychotic or manic symptoms. During her first follow-up visit, the patient reported an increasingly depressed mood, and intermittent episodes of suicidal ideation without plan in the 3 days before her visit, which were increasing in intensity after increase of lamotrigine. The decision to stop lamotrigine was made due to the increased intensity of suicidal thoughts that seemed to correlate with the increase in dosage. On next follow-up visit, the patient's depressive symptoms had resolved. Further studies are needed to evaluate the exact danger of suicidality associated with the use of lamotrigine and guide the mental health professionals in making treatment decisions.

1444,Clinical Effects and Adverse Reactions of Off-Label Use of Aripiprazole in Children and Adolescents with Developmental Disabilities,"Objective: The aim of this study was to report on the clinical efficacy and side effects of aripiprazole in treating behavioral symptoms of children with a developmental disability (DDs). Design/Methods: A retrospective chart review of the first 32 children treated with aripiprazole at an urban clinic for children with DD was conducted. Results: Ages ranged from 5 to 19 years; 9 (28%) were female. Twenty four had diagnoses within the autistic spectrum and 18 had mental retardation (MR). Other disorders included: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder/disruptive behavior disorders (n = 13), mood disorders (n = 7), reactive attachment (n = 2), and sleep disorders (n = 2). Target symptoms included aggression, hyperactivity, impulsivity and, self-injurious behaviors. Twenty eight of the children were switched from another antipsychotic. The mean daily aripiprazole starting dose was 7.1 Â± 0.32 mg (0.17 mg/kg/day) and the mean daily maintenance dose was 10.55 Â± 6.9 mg (0.27 mg/kg/day). Aripiprazole had been used for a period between 6 and 15 months. Improvement in target symptoms was found in 56%. When treating a child with MR, the concomitant presence of an autistic spectrum diagnosis predicted a worse outcome. Side effects were reported in 16 (50%), with the most frequent being sleepiness (n = 6). Mean body mass index (BMI) rose from 22.5 to 24.1 (p = 0.003) over the follow up period, with changes in the BMI z scores. These changes were more pronounced in children younger than 12 years. Conclusions: These results with aripiprazole in this difficult-to-treat population suggest that this medication warrants controlled studies of its effectiveness and safety.

1445,Reasons for attempted suicide in later life,"Objective: Using the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide as a guiding framework, we investigated older adults' causal attributions for suicidal behavior. We hypothesized that older adults who attributed their suicidal behavior to thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness would be more likely to use more immediately lethal means and to re-attempt suicide during the 12-month follow-up. Design: Prospective cohort study in western Sweden. Participants: A total of 101 older adults who presented to medical emergency rooms for suicide attempts. Measurements: Participants were asked why they attempted suicide. Results: Attributions included: a desire to escape (N = 29), reduced functioning and autonomy (N = 24), psychological problems, including depression (N = 24), somatic problems and physical pain (N = 16), perceived burdensomeness (N = 13), social problems that reflected either thwarted belongingness or family conflict (N = 13), and lack of meaning in life (N = 8); 41 participants provided more than one reason. No specific reason was given by 28 participants, 15 of whom reported not understanding or remembering why they attempted suicide and 13 reported simply wanting to die (or go to sleep and not wake up). As hypothesized, patients who attributed the attempt to thwarted belongingness were more likely to use more immediately lethal means for their index attempt and were more likely to re-attempt during follow-up. This was not the case for those reporting burdensomeness. Conclusion: People who attribute suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness use more lethal methods and have a poorer prognosis. Replications across diverse cultural settings are needed to determine whether attributing suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness may warrant increased monitoring.

1446,Reducing suicidal thoughts in the Australian general population through web-based self-help: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Suicidal thoughts are common in the general population, causing significant disability. However, a substantial number of people struggling with suicidality do not access appropriate services. Online self-help may help overcome barriers to help-seeking. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of an online self-help program targeted at reducing suicidal thoughts compared with an attention-matched control condition in the Australian adult population. This trial is based on a Dutch self-help program, which was found to be effective in reducing suicidal thoughts.; Methods/design: A total of 570 community-dwelling adults (18 to 65Â years old) with suicidal thoughts will be recruited via various media and randomly assigned to the 6-week online program aimed at reducing suicidal thoughts or a 6-week attention-matched control program. Primary outcome measure is the severity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures include suicide plans, capacity to cope with suicidal thoughts, reasons for living, symptoms of depression, hopelessness, anxiety/worry, rumination, panic, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, acquired capability, alcohol consumption, insomnia, and various cost-effectiveness measures.; Discussion: Although the original Dutch trial found web-based self-help to be effective in reducing suicidal thoughts, randomized controlled trials (RCT) of online programs for suicidal thoughts are rare. The present study extends previous research by running the first English language RCT of this sort. As a result of the original study, the current RCT includes refinements to the design, including greater levels of participant anonymity and longer follow-up periods. Limitations of this trial include the potential for high drop-out and the inability to ascertain whether any suicides occur during the study.; Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) Registration number: ACTRN12613000410752 (15 April 2013).

The Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) was developed and validated as a brief, webâ€based measure for severity of suicidal ideation, using an online survey of Australian adults (n = 1,352). The SIDAS demonstrated high internal consistency and good convergent validity. Frequency and controllability of thoughts were more strongly associated with suicide plans and attempts than other attributes assessed. Scores â‰¥ 21 indicated high risk of suicide behavior.

1448,Randomized control trial of computer-based rehabilitation of spatial neglect syndrome: The RESPONSE trial protocol,"Background: Spatial neglect is a frequent and debilitating consequence of acquired brain injury and currently has no widely accepted standard of care. While previous interventions for spatial neglect have targeted patientsâ€™ overt spatial deficits (e.g., reduced contralesional visual scanning), far fewer have directly targeted patientsâ€™ non-spatial deficits (e.g., sustained attention deficits). Considering that non-spatial deficits have shown to be highly predictive of long-term disability, we developed a novel computer based training program that targets both sustained (tonic) and moment-to-moment (phasic) aspects of non-spatial attention (Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training, TAPAT). Preliminary studies demonstrate that TAPAT is safe and effective in improving both spatial and non-spatial attention deficits in the post-acute recovery phase in neglect patients. The purpose of the current trial (referred to as the REmediation of SPatial Neglect or RESPONSE trial) is to compare TAPAT to an active control training condition, include a larger sample of patients, and assess both cognitive and functional outcomes. Methods/Design: We will employ a multi-site, longitudinal, blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a target sample of 114 patients with spatial neglect. Patients will either perform, at their home, the experimental TAPAT training program or an active control computer games condition for thirty minutes/day, five days a week, over three months. Patients will be assessed on a battery of cognitive and functional outcomes on three occasions: a) immediately before training, b) within forty-eight hours post completion of total training, and c) after a three-month no-contact period post completion of total training, to assess the longevity of potential training effects. Discussion: The strengths of this protocol are that it tests an innovative, in-home administered treatment that targets a fundamental deficit in neglect, employs highly sensitive computer-based assessments of cognition as well as functional outcomes, and incorporates a large sample size (relative to other neglect treatment studies) in an RCT design.

1449,Antisuicidal Response Following Ketamine Infusion Is Associated With Decreased Nighttime Wakefulness in Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder,"Objective: Insomnia and disrupted sleep are associated with increased risk of suicide. The N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts, but the mechanism of action is unknown. This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine.; Methods: Thirty-four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n = 23) or bipolar depression (n = 11) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes). Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item, the suicide item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness, as verified by EEG, between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not, controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness. Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls (n = 22).; Results: After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep, participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response (Fâ‚,â‚‚â‚‚ = 5.04, P = .04). Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level (Fâ‚,â‚„â‚€ = 3.15, P = .08).; Conclusions: Reductions in wakefulness following ketamine may point to a biological mechanism underlying the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation.; Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00088699.; Â© Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.Bipolar Disorder*/complications, Bipolar Disorder*/diagnosis, Bipolar Disorder*/drug therapy, Bipolar Disorder*/psychology, Depressive Disorder, Major*/complications, Depressive Disorder, Major*/diagnosis, Depressive Disorder, Major*/drug therapy, Depressive Disorder, Major*/psychology, Ketamine*/administration & dosage, Ketamine*/adverse effects, Suicide*/prevention & control, Suicide*/psychology, Wakefulness/*drug effects, Administration, Intravenous, Adult, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Drug Monitoring/methods, Drug Resistance, Electroencephalography/methods, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/adverse effects, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Suicidal Ideation, Treatment Outcome","Vande Voort, Jennifer L.; Ballard, Elizabeth D.; Luckenbaugh, David A.; Bernert, Rebecca A.; Richards, Erica M.; Niciu, Mark J.; Park, Lawrence T.; Machado-Vieira, Rodrigo; Duncan, Wallace C, Jr & Zarate, Carlos A, Jr",1,1449
1450,August 2003 heat wave in France: risk factors for death of elderly people living at home,"The August 2003 heat wave in France resulted in many thousands of excess deaths particularly of elderly people. Individual and environmental risk factors for death among the community-dwelling elderly were identified. We conducted a case-control survey and defined cases as people aged 65 years and older who lived at home and died from August 8 through August 13 from causes other than accident, suicide, or surgical complications. Controls were matched with cases for age, sex, and residential area. Interviewers used questionnaires to collect data. Satellite pictures provided profiles of the heat island characteristics around the homes. Lack of mobility was a major risk factor along with some pre-existing medical conditions. Housing characteristics associated with death were lack of thermal insulation and sleeping on the top floor, right under the roof. The temperature around the building was a major risk factor. Behaviour such as dressing lightly and use of cooling techniques and devices were protective factors. These findings suggest people with pre-existing medical conditions were likely to be vulnerable during heat waves and need information on how to adjust daily routines to heat waves. In the long term, building insulation and urban planning must be adapted to provide protection from possible heat waves.; Temperature*, Aged, 80 and over/*statistics & numerical data, Heat Stroke/*etiology, Heat Stroke/*mortality, Housing/*statistics & numerical data, Air Conditioning, Case-Control Studies, City Planning, Comorbidity, Female, France, Geriatric Assessment, Health Education, Health Services Needs and Demand, Heat Stroke/prevention & control, Humans, Male, Meteorological Concepts, Mobility Limitation, Multivariate Analysis, Public Health Practice, Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Urban Health/statistics & numerical data","Vandentorren, S.; Bretin, P.; Zeghnoun, A.; Mandereau-Bruno, L.; Croisier, A.; Cochet, C.; RibÃ©ron, J.; Siberan, I.; Declercq, B. & Ledrans, M.",0,1450
1451,Asthma and allergy as risk factors for suicidal behavior among young adults,"An association between allergic disease, depression and suicidality has been reported. Objective: To explore the relationships between suicidality and asthma, allergy, internet addiction, stress, sleep quality, pain/discomfort, and depression, among emerging adults. Participants: 929 college students completed an online survey between October 2015 and April 2017. Methods: A cross-sectional study using multivariate analysis techniques was implemented. Results: Using structural equation modeling, we found that allergies and stress were directly related to pain/discomfort; pain/discomfort was associated to poor sleep, depression, and suicidality. Sleep quality was also affected by stress; while sleep, stress, pain/discomfort, and internet addiction were directly related to depression (all p < .05). Ultimately, four factors impacted suicidality: stress, pain/discomfort, depression, and, indirectly, sleep quality (all p < .05). Although allergy had some effects, these did not reach statistical significance (p < .09). Conclusion: Findings suggest that allergy might impact suicidality indirectly through increased pain/discomfort, poor sleep, and depression.

1452,Against the stream: intermittent nurse observations of in-patients at night serve no purpose and cause sleep deprivation,"This paper argues that intermittent nursing observations of in-patients at night do not reduce the risk of suicide or severe self-harm. Suicides between 23.00 h and 07.00 h are rare, and these overwhelmingly occur under intermittent observations. Such observation is purely a defensive intervention to document that a patient is safe at a particular time, as there is no engagement. For the large majority of in-patients, it has the unintended consequence of causing sleep deprivation. The intervention may cause harm to in-patients by making their disorder worse and increase their risk during the day. If patients are judged to be at immediate risk, then they should be placed on constant observation. If they are not, then optimising sleep is important for treating a psychiatric disorder and they should be placed on general observations.Declaration of interestNone.; In-patient treatment, psychiatric nursing, risk assessment, suicide","Veale, David",0,1452

1454,Association Between Playing American Football in the National Football League and Long-term Mortality,"Importance: Studies of the longevity of professional American football players have demonstrated lower mortality relative to the general population but they may have been susceptible to selection bias.; Objective: To examine the association between career participation in professional American football and mortality risk in retirement.; Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study involving 3812 retired US National Football League (NFL) players who debuted in the NFL between 1982 and 1992, including regular NFL players (nâ€‰=â€‰2933) and NFL replacement players"" (nâ€‰=â€‰879) who were temporarily hired to play during a 3-game league-wide player strike in 1987. Follow-up ended on December 31 2016.; Exposures: NFL participation as a career player or as a replacement player.; Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality by December 31 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated to compare the observed number of years from age 22 years until death (or censoring) adjusted for birth year body mass index height and position played. Information on player death and cause of death was ascertained from a search of the National Death Index and web-based sources.; Results: Of the 3812 men included in this study (mean [SD] age at first NFL activity 23.4 [1.5] years) there were 2933 career NFL players (median NFL tenure 5 seasons [interquartile range {IQR} 2-8]; median follow-up 30 years [IQR 27-33]) and 879 replacement players (median NFL tenure 1 season [IQR 1-1]; median follow-up 31 years [IQR 1.0% [95% CI -0.7% to 2.7%]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.25). The adjusted mortality hazard ratio for NFL players relative to replacements was 1.38 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.99; Pâ€‰=â€‰.09). Among career NFL players the most common causes of death were cardiometabolic disease (nâ€‰=â€‰51; 35.4%) transportation injuries (nâ€‰=â€‰20; 13.9%) unintentional injuries (nâ€‰=â€‰15; 10.4%) and neoplasms (nâ€‰=â€‰15; 10.4%). Among NFL replacement players the leading causes of death were cardiometabolic diseases (nâ€‰=â€‰19; 51.4%) self-harm and interpersonal violence (nâ€‰=â€‰5; 13.5%) and neoplasms (nâ€‰=â€‰4; 10.8%).; Conclusions and Relevance: Among NFL football players who began their careers between 1982 and 1992 career participation in the NFL compared with limited NFL exposure obtained primarily as an NFL replacement player during a league-wide strike was not associated with a statistically significant difference in long-term all-cause mortality. Given the small number of events analysis of longer periods of follow-up may be informative.; ""Football*/injuries, Mortality*, Adult, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/mortality, Cause of Death, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, Retrospective Studies, United States/epidemiology, Young Adult","Venkataramani, Atheendar S.; Gandhavadi, Maheer & Jena, Anupam B.",0,1454
1455,Testing the cognitive catalyst model with idiographic content: Rumination moderates the association between self-discrepancies and depressive symptoms,"Depressive rumination, which involves repetitive thinking directed at oneâ€™s depressive symptoms and the perceived causes and consequences of those symptoms, plays an important role in the onset and maintenance of depression. Recently, Ciesla, and Roberts (2002, 2007; Ciesla, Felton, & Roberts, 2011) proposed the cognitive catalyst model of depression, which posits that rumination intensifies the impact of already existing negative cognitions. Previous studies examining rumination as a moderator of cognitive content have used nomothetic conceptualizations of cognitive content. The current research replicated and extended these past studies using an idiographic conceptualization of negative cognitive content, specifically self-discrepancy theory (SDT). SDT suggests that idiographic self-guides serve to direct behavior and govern self-regulation (Higgins, 1987). Two studies based on college student samples (N = 102 and N = 107) tested the interaction between rumination and self-discrepancies in the prediction of depressive symptoms. In line with the cognitive catalyst model, Study 1 found that rumination moderated the association between actual:ideal self- discrepancies and depressive symptoms, such that self-discrepancies predicted depression more strongly among high compared to low ruminators. Study 2 found that the interaction between rumination and actual:ideal self-discrepancies was specific to predicting dysphoric mood and insomnia versus other dimensions of depressive symptoms, such as lassitude, appetite change and suicidality, and that these effects were limited to males. Results from the two studies provide further support for the cognitive catalyst model by demonstrating that rumination amplifies the association between self-discrepancies and depression and suggests that these effects may be specific to dysphoric mood and insomnia (at least for males) as opposed to other forms of depressive symptomatology.

1456,"Sleep Disturbances, Psychosocial Difficulties, and Health Risk Behavior in 16,781 Dutch Adolescents","Objective: To investigate the prevalence of adolescent sleep disturbances and their relation to psychosocial difficulties and health risk behaviors with the use of data from a province-wide health survey (nâ€‰=â€‰16,781).; Methods: Psychosocial difficulties were measured with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Additional assessments included self-reported sleep disturbances, suicidality, and health risk behaviors including current use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, physical inactivity, and compulsive use of multimedia. We used multilevel analyses to investigate the relationhips, including differences, between boys and girls, as well as the mediating role of emotional problems.; Results: Just under 20% of adolescents reported sleep disturbances in the previous month. These sleep disturbances were associated with psychosocial problems (odds ratio [OR], 6.42; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), suicidality (OR, 3.90-4.14; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and all health risk behaviors (OR, 1.62-2.66; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), but not with physical inactivity. We found moderation by gender for the relations between sleep and suicide attempts (OR, 0.38; Pâ€‰<â€‰.002) and between sleep and cannabis use (OR, 0.52; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002), indicating attenuated relationships in girls compared with boys. Emotional problems partially mediated the relationships between sleep disturbances and multimedia use.; Conclusions: This study reiterates the high prevalence of sleep disturbances during adolescence. These sleep disturbances were strongly related to psychosocial problems and a wide range of health risk behaviors. Although the direction of causality cannot be inferred, this study emphasizes the need for awareness of impaired sleep in adolescents. Moreover, the gender differences in associated suicide attempts and cannabis use call for further research into tailored intervention strategies.; Copyright Â© 2018 Academic Pediatric Association.

1457,Memory impairment in those who attempted suicide by benzodiazepine overdose,"Background: A prospective study was conducted to investigate the presence of anterograde amnesia in those who attempted suicide by benzodiazepine overdose and to study the correlation with sedation.; Method: In 43 patients who attempted suicide by taking benzodiazepines, memory was tested with a 15-word memory recall task. The immediate and delayed recall on the first day after admission (day 1) and 24 hours later (day 2) were rated. Each patient and the interviewer scored the patient's degree of sedation on a visual analogue scale. Patients also had to try to recognize, from photographs, the psychiatrist with whom they had spoken the day before.; Results: The ratings of immediate and delayed recall were significantly lower on day 1 than on day 2. Subjective ratings of sedation of the patients were not significantly higher than the ratings of the observer. Less than half of the patients recognized the psychiatrists and knew that they were the ones they had spoken to the day before.; Conclusion: Anterograde amnesia is present in suicide attempters who take overdoses of benzodiazepines.

The patient had been well until approximately 2 years earlier, when insomnia, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation, followed by severe depression and suicidal ideation, developed. After two inpatient psychiatric admissions, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was made. The patient's symptoms were controlled with lithium, 900 mg at bedtime, and citalopram, 40 mg per day, for the next 9 months. One week after discharge, sertraline was added to the patient's medications because of persistent depression, and 10 days later, she came to the emergency room because of thoughts of harming her baby. She was transferred to a psychiatric hospital affiliated with this institution, and eight sessions of electroconvulsive therapy were administered. One week later, at a follow-up visit with her psychiatrist, the patient was alert and appropriate, and her mood appeared to be normal. She was working half-time and was able to take care of her baby. Her medications were olanzapine, citalopram, and lithium.

Ss completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to evaluate degree of psychic stress. Mental trauma was found in 78 Ss. Ss in the trauma group had a higher GHQ score than did the 92 Ss in the nontrauma group. The main psychiatric diagnoses were personality disorder in the trauma group and neurosis in the nontrauma group. At the time of the examination, anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts were more common in the trauma group than in the nontrauma group. Objective mental traumas during childhood and adolescence seem to be associated with an inability to use mature ways of coping during acute psychiatric problems in adulthood.

1461,Suicide Attempt Characteristics Among Veterans and Active-Duty Service Members Receiving Mental Health Services: A Pooled Data Analysis,"Past suicidal behaviors are among the strongest and most consistent predictors of eventual suicide and may be particularly salient in military suicide. The current study compared characteristics of suicide attempts in veterans (N = 746) and active-duty service members (N = 1,013) receiving treatment for acute suicide risk. Baseline data from six randomized controlled trials were pooled and analyzed using robust regression. Service members had greater odds of having attempted suicide relative to veterans, though there were no differences in number of attempts made. Service members also had higher rates of premilitary suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Veterans disproportionately attempted suicide by means of overdose. In veterans, combat deployment was associated with lower odds of lifetime suicide attempt, while history of NSSI was associated with greater attempt odds. Neither was significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempt in service members.

After a 2-month inpatient psychiatric admission for worsening psychosis and suicidal ideation, he was referred to partial hospital program for ongoing psychiatric treatment. His hospitalizations were often precipitated by the emergence of command auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and thought broadcasting. His substance use consisted of significant and chronic alcohol use, and he had made multiple attempts to achieve sobriety with the assistance of detoxification and 12-step programs. His medications included aripiprazol, and risperidone. To reduce the risk of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, he was being treated with lactulose. He received diphenhydramine, and zolpidem, each night for insomnia. In the month following his medical hospitalization, his mental status remained stable, but his program attendance and participation lagged. He frequently acknowledged his understanding that the combination of his liver disease and any ongoing substance use could eventually prove fatal. At discharge, he was provided with both medical and psychiatric follow-up care and resources to help him maintain sobriety. Implications and applications of this case report are discussed.

1463,Suicidal events in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS),"Objective: The Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) database was analyzed to determine whether suicidal events (attempts and ideation) occurred early in treatment, could be predicted by severity of depression or other clinical characteristics, and were preceded by clinical deterioration or symptoms of increased irritability, akathisia, sleep disruption, or mania. Method: TADS was a 36-week randomized, controlled clinical trial of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments involving 439 youths with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria). Suicidal events were defined according to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicidal Assessment. Patients were randomly assigned into the study between spring 2000 and summer 2003. Results: Forty-four patients (10.0%) had at least 1 suicidal event (no suicide occurred). Events occurred 0.4 to 31.1 weeks (mean Â± SD = 11.9 Â± 8.2) after starting TADS treatment, with no difference in event timing for patients receiving medication versus those not receiving medication. Severity of self-rated pretreatment suicidal ideation (Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire adapted for adolescents score â‰¥31) and depressive symptoms (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale score â‰¥91) predicted occurrence of suicidal events during treatment (P < .05). Patients with suicidal events were on average still moderately ill prior to the event (mean Â± SD Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale score = 4.0 Â± 1.3) and only minimally improved (mean Â± SD Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale score = 3.2 Â± 1.1). Events were not preceded by increased irritability, akathisia, sleep disturbance, or manic signs. Specific interpersonal stressors were identified in 73% of cases (N = 44). Of the events, 55% (N = 24) resulted in overnight hospitalization. Conclusions: Most suicidal events occurred in the context of persistent depression and insufficient improvement without evidence of medication-induced behavioral activation as a precursor. Severity of self-rated suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms predicted emergence of suicidality during treatment. Risk for suicidal events did not decrease after the first month of treatment, suggesting the need for careful clinical monitoring for several months after starting treatment.

1464,Chronic pain among homeless persons with mental illness,"Objective: Chronic pain is an important public health issue. However, characteristics and needs of marginalized populations have received limited attention. Studies on prevalence and correlates of chronic pain among homeless persons are lacking. We assessed chronic pain among homeless persons with mental illness in the At Home/Chez Soi study. Design: Cross-sectional data from a randomized controlled trial on homelessness and mental health. Setting: Data collected between 2009 and 2013 in three Canadian cities. Subjects: One thousand two hundred eighty-seven homeless persons with mental illness. Methods: Data on chronic pain and utilization of prescribed and nonprescribed interventions was assessed using a chronic pain screening instrument. Mental illness was diagnosed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results: Forty-three percent reported moderate to severe chronic pain, interfering with general daily activities (80%), sleep (78%), and social interactions (61%). Multivariate analysis indicated that increasing age and diagnoses of major depressive disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were independent predictors of chronic pain. Chronic pain was further associated with increased suicidality. Among participants reporting chronic pain, 64% had sought medical treatment and 56% treated pain with prescribed drugs, while 38% used illicit drugs for pain relief. Conclusions: Chronic pain is very common among homeless persons with mental illness and affects activities of daily living. Clinicians treating this population should be aware of the common connections between chronic pain, depression, panic disorder, PTSD, and substance use. While the data indicate the contribution of chronic pain to complex treatment needs, they also indicate a clear treatment gap.

Methods: Female and male twins (n = 20632) were followed with regard to mortality from 1973 through 1996. Questionnaire data from 1973 were used to obtain information on experience of unemployment and on social, behavioral, health, and personality characteristics. Results: Unemployment was associated with an increased risk of suicide and death from undetermined causes. Low education, personality characteristics, use of sleeping pills or tranquilizers, and serious or long-lasting illness tended to strengthen the association between unemployment and early mortality. Conclusions: An increased risk of death from external causes implies a need for support for those experiencing unemployment, particularly susceptible individuals.

We assessed the side effect and seizure reduction profile of tiagabine (TGB) in typical clinical practice. Methods: Investigators recorded adverse effect (AE), seizure, and assessment-of-benefit data prospectively in sequential patients treated open label with TGB. Results: Two hundred ninety-two patients (39 children) were enrolled to be treated long term with TGB. Seizure types were focal-onset (86%), generalized-onset (12%), both focal- and generalized-onset (0.3%), and multiple associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (2%). Two hundred thirty-one received at least one dose of TGB (median = 28 mg/day) and had follow-up seizure or AE data reported. Common AEs were fatigue, dizziness, psychomotor slowing, ataxia, gastrointestinal upset, weight change, insomnia, and â€œothersâ€ (mostly behavioral). Serious AEs occurred in 19 patients: behavioral effects (n = 12), status epilepticus (n = 3), others (n = 3), and sudden unexplained death (n = 1). No patients experienced suicidal ideation/behavior, rash, nephrolithiasis, or organ failure. Seizure outcomes were seizure freedom (5%), â‰¥ 75% reduction (12%), â‰¥ 50% reduction (23%), and increased number of seizures (17%), or new seizure type (1%). Conclusions: Behavioral AEs occurred in a larger proportion of patients compared to those reported in TGB preapproval randomized controlled trials. Amoderate percentage of patients had a meaningful reduction in seizure frequency. In clinical practice, TGB remains a useful antiepileptic drug.

1467,The onset of effect for escitalopram and its relevance for the clinical management of depression,"Objective: To analyse the significance of 'onset of effect' on clinical outcome in the treatment of depression and the contribution of individual Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) items to improvements in the MADRS total score.; Research Design and Method: All five published placebo-controlled clinical studies in depression as per January 1, 2005, with escitalopram, were included in this pooled analysis.; Results: Of the 1636 patients who were randomised to either escitalopram (882) or placebo (754), 1333 completed 8 weeks of treatment (707 escitalopram and 626 placebo). A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the MADRS total score responses of escitalopram and placebo treatments was observed at week 1. All 10 MADRS single items showed a significant treatment effect at week 8. For items representing core symptoms of depression (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, concentration difficulties, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts and suicidal thoughts) the effect was detected early (week 1) and for other items (reduced sleep, reduced appetite and lassitude) the effect was detected later (week 6-8). Of the patients who showed an onset of effect (> or = 20% reduction in MADRS) after 2 weeks, and who remained on escitalopram until week 8, 63% were in remission at week 8 (mean MADRS score of 6.1).; Conclusion: Onset of treatment response at 2 weeks is an important indicator of subsequent remission at 8 weeks. It would therefore be a reasonable clinical recommendation that if patients fail to show a measurable clinical improvement within 2 weeks, a dose increase should be considered at this time.;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use, Citalopram/*therapeutic use, Depression/*drug therapy, Adult, Aged, Depression/physiopathology, Depression/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multicenter Studies as Topic, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome","Wade, Alan & Friis Andersen, Henning",0,1467

1469,Beyond reactive versus endogenous: Should uncomplicated stress-triggered depression be excluded from major depression diagnosis? A review of the evidence,"The concept of an uncomplicated depressive episode was introduced in the DSM-III's bereavement exclusion"" to major depressive disorder (MDD). It represented an attempt to distinguish among depressive reactions to the loss of a loved one between those depressions that are normal bereavement-related depressive feelings and those that are depressive disorders. As defined by the DSM an ""uncomplicated"" depressive episode is one that satisfies the DSM's symptom and duration diagnostic criteria for MDD but does not cause marked impairment lacks severe pathosuggestive symptoms such as suicidal- ideation psychotic ideation intense feelings of worthlessness and psychomotor retardation and remits after a relatively brief time. Thus uncomplicated episodes include only symptoms - such as sadness or low mood crying decreased pleasure difficulty concentrating loss of interest fatigue insomnia and decreased appetite - that are common in normal distress reactions. Recent studies raise the question whether uncomplicated stress-triggered depressive reactions to any major stressor (not just in reaction to bereavement) form a typologically distinct category different from other MDD and indicative of normal distress. Because the uncomplicated/complicated distinction is a distinction between reactive depressions it does not resuscitate the repudiated endogenous/reactive distinction. We review the sequence of studies that have been carried out recently exploring the validity of the uncomplicated/complicated distinction as an indicator of normality/disorder across reactive depressions following all stressors not just bereavement. Both the concurrent validity (with regard to a large range of validators) and predictive validity (using recurrence as a validator) of the uncomplicated/complicated distinction have been subjected to rigorous tests for the first time and the results consistently support the validity of the distinction. However initial studies of concurrent validity suffered from a series of methodological limitations leaving the answer inconclusive. Recent studies have systematically addressed all of the major objections to the early studies. The results disconfirm the earlier objections and strongly support the validity of the uncomplicated/complicated distinction as an indicator of normal versus disordered depressive episodes. If the uncomplicated/complicated distinction has validity across stressors this has important potential prognostic and treatment implications and might also contribute to a much-needed clarification of the boundary between intense normal sadness and depressive disorder.

1470,Cardiac left bundle branch block and pancytopenia in anorexia nervosa: Higher risk with mirtazapine and pantoprazole? Case report,"Patients suffering from anorexia nervosa are a high risk population for serious cardiac abnormalities and they display the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. In this study presents a case report of 36-year-old female patient suffering from an atypical anorexia nervosa and from a depressive episode with suicidal ideation. She developed her eating disorder 17 years ago, when she studied at university, resulting in an important mental pressure and leading to a first hospitalization at the age of 30 years. During the years preceding the present hospitalization, medical treatment was accomplished in an ambulant setting until the patient showed a progressive development of extreme weight loss, insomnia, social withdrawal and disturbances of concentration during the past eight months. At hospitalization, the patient was depressive and hopeless. This patient apparently presented a previously not reported situation of anorexia nervosa of a restricting type, complicated by the development of a cardial left bundle branch block and a pancytopenia, mainly due to mirtazapine. Taking account of the literature, pantoprazole is probably not involved in the development of these adverse effects.

1471,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for fibromyalgia syndrome,"Background: Fibromyalgia is a clinically well-defined chronic condition with a biopsychosocial aetiology. Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, sleep problems, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue. Patients often report high disability levels and poor quality of life. Since there is no specific treatment that alters the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia, drug therapy focuses on pain reduction and improvement of other aversive symptoms.; Objectives: The objective was to assess the benefits and harms of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of fibromyalgia.; Search Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2014), EMBASE (1946 to June 2014), and the reference lists of reviewed articles.; Selection Criteria: We selected all randomized, double-blind trials of SSRIs used for the treatment of fibromyalgia symptoms in adult participants. We considered the following SSRIs in this review: citalopram, fluoxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline.; Data Collection and Analysis: Three authors extracted the data of all included studies and assessed the risks of bias of the studies. We resolved discrepancies by discussion.; Main Results: The quality of evidence was very low for each outcome. We downgraded the quality of evidence to very low due to concerns about risk of bias and studies with few participants. We included seven placebo-controlled studies, two with citalopram, three with fluoxetine and two with paroxetine, with a median study duration of eight weeks (4 to 16 weeks) and 383 participants, who were pooled together.All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias. There was a small (10%) difference in patients who reported a 30% pain reduction between SSRIs (56/172 (32.6%)) and placebo (39/171 (22.8%)) risk difference (RD) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.20; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 10, 95% CI 5 to 100; and in global improvement (proportion of patients who reported to be much or very much improved: 50/168 (29.8%) of patients with SSRIs and 26/162 (16.0%) of patients with placebo) RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23; NNTB 7, 95% CI 4 to 17.SSRIs did not statistically, or clinically, significantly reduce fatigue: standard mean difference (SMD) -0.26, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.03; 7.0% absolute improvement on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 14.6% relative improvement to 0.8% relative deterioration; nor sleep problems: SMD 0.03, 95 % CI -0.26 to 0.31; 0.8 % absolute deterioration on a 0 to 100 scale, 95% CI 8.3% relative deterioration to 6.9% relative improvement.SSRIs were superior to placebo in the reduction of depression: SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; 7.6% absolute improvement on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI 2.7% to 13.8% relative improvement; NNTB 13, 95% CI 7 to 37. The dropout rate due to adverse events was not higher with SSRI use than with placebo use (23/146 (15.8%) of patients with SSRIs and 14/138 (10.1%) of patients with placebo) RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.14. There was no statistically or clinically significant difference in serious adverse events with SSRI use and placebo use (3/84 (3.6%) in patients with SSRIs and 4/84 (4.8%) and patients with placebo) RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.05.; Authors' Conclusions: There is no unbiased evidence that SSRIs are superior to placebo in treating the key symptoms of fibromyalgia, namely pain, fatigue and sleep problems. SSRIs might be considered for treating depression in people with fibromyalgia. The black box warning for increased suicidal tendency in young adults aged 18 to 24, with major depressive disorder, who have taken SSRIs, should be considered when appropriate.;Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Citalopram/therapeutic use, Fluoxetine/therapeutic use, Humans, Melatonin/therapeutic use, Musculoskeletal Pain/drug therapy, Musculoskeletal Pain/etiology, Paroxetine/therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Syndrome","Walitt, Brian; UrrÃºtia, Gerard; Nishishinya, MarÃ­a Betina; Cantrell, Sarah E & HÃ¤user, Winfried",0,1471
1472,Sleep-related problems and suicide behavior and ideation among black and white trauma-exposed psychiatric inpatients,"Sleep-related problems (SRPs) are associated with increased risk for suicide-related behavior and death. Given that Black adults report greater SRPs as compared to White adults, the purpose of the current study was to examine sleep problems, suicide-related psychiatric admission, and suicide ideation, in Black and White trauma-exposed adults. METHOD: Suicide-related behavior (i.e., intent, plan, and/or behavior) as reason for hospital admission was obtained via medical records review for 172 Black and White adults who were admitted to an acute-care psychiatric facility; all participants completed validated measures of sleep quality and suicide ideation. RESULTS: Adjusted logistic regression analyses revealed that sleep-related daytime dysfunction (AORâ€¯=â€¯4.32, pâ€¯<â€¯.05) and poor sleep quality (AORâ€¯=â€¯3.64, pâ€¯<â€¯.05) were associated with significantly increased odds that Black participants were admitted for suicide-related psychiatric care. Poorer sleep quality (AORâ€¯=â€¯2.10, pâ€¯<â€¯.05) was also associated with increased odds of suicide-related admission among White participants. However, shorter sleep duration was marginally associated with suicide ideation in Black participants only. CONCLUSIONS: SRPs may be related to suicide-related behavior and ideation differently for vulnerable Black and White adults. More research is needed to understand potential race group differences and mechanisms by which SRPs increase risk for suicide crisis across racial groups","Walker, Rheeda L.; Talavera, David C.; Nomamiukor, Faith; Madubata, Ijeoma J.; Alfano, Candice; Vujanovic, Anka A.",1,1472
1473,Posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury in current military populations: A critical analysis,"Background: The use of unconventional weaponry combined with decreased mortality rates and servicemembers being exposed to intense ground combat during multiple deployments has increased the risk of servicemembers living with the consequences of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and combat operational stress. Objective: The purpose of this article is to perform a critical analysis of the literature to identify current rates of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI in military and veteran populations who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan and their combined effects on persistent postconcussive symptoms. Design: A search of the literature with military and veteran populations published after 2001 in Pubmed, OVID/Medline, Cochran Database, Embase, Scopus, CIHL, and PsycInfo was conducted using keywords. Results: Twenty studies met inclusion criteria. The literature search yielded mixed results for rates of PTSD, TBI, and comorbid conditions. Conclusions: There is some evidence that comorbid PTSD and TBI result in greater reports of postconcussive symptomology than either condition alone. Limitations include lack of consistency of measurements, sampling biases, and lack of experimental design, and these warrant further exploration. Future research is needed to decrease variability in study findings and elucidate relationships between these disorders and their effects on persistent postconcussive symptomology.

1474,Morbidity associated with sleep disorders in primary care: a longitudinal cohort study,"Objective: Few epidemiologic studies evaluate the relative contribution of different risk factors on sleep problems. The aim of the present study was to assess demographics, comorbid characteristics, and health outcomes in patients with sleep disorders.; Method: A population-based cohort study with nested case-control analysis was conducted in adults using the U.K. General Practice Research Database. Information was collected for 12,437 patients with a new sleep disorder diagnosis during the year 1996 and 18,350 age- and sex-matched controls. Logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).; Results: The incidence of a new sleep disorder diagnosis was 12.5 per 1000 person-years. There was a clear association of sleep disorders with smoking and excessive alcohol consumption; prior psychiatric disorders, including stress (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 2.9 to 4.4) and depression (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.8 to 3.3); prior circulatory diseases, including heart failure (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4 to 2.2) and coronary heart disease (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.6); and prior gastrointestinal diseases, including gastroesopha-geal reflux disease (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.7) and irritable bowel syndrome (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.9). Use of hypnotics and anti-depressants was increased in the year after diagnosis. Relative 1-year mortality risk was 3-fold higher in the sleep disorder group than in controls, with a noticeably higher proportion of deaths due to suicide.; Conclusion: The fact that sleep disorders were associated with several morbidities, most strongly with psychiatric disorders as well as with increased mortality, underscores the importance of sleep problems as indicators of health status.; ","Wallander, Mari-Ann; Johansson, Saga; RuigÃ³mez, Ana; GarcÃ­a RodrÃ­guez, Luis A. & Jones, Roger",1,1474
1475,Screening for depression among youth with HIV in an integrated care setting,"Youth living with HIV (YLWH) are at risk for depression. Depressive symptoms can impact treatment engagement, health outcomes, and quality of life. Early identification of symptoms can guide treatment planning. This study aimed to identify trends in depressive symptoms for YLWH in a specialty-care clinic and follow-up clinical treatment procedures. An archival review of a clinical database provided depression screening information for a sample of 130 YLWH between 11 and 25 years old in the southeastern United States. Findings indicated that approximately 24% of the sample screened positive for depression-risk. Most commonly endorsed symptoms included fatigue (54.3%) and sleep difficulties (48.5%). Depressive symptoms did not differ significantly by age, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Youth who acquired HIV behaviorally were more likely to endorse the critical item (i.e., self-harm and/or suicidal ideation) than youth who acquired HIV perinatally. Forty-percent of the sample (i.e., 51 youth) had a follow-up treatment plan. YLWH who endorsed the critical item were more likely to receive follow-up action when compared to those who did not endorse the item.

1476,Management of Post-Traumatic Nightmares: a Review of Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatments Since 2013,"Purpose Of Review: Post-traumatic nightmares (PTN) are a common and enduring problem for individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other clinical presentations. PTN cause significant distress, are associated with large costs, and are an independent risk factor for suicide. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for PTN exist. A previous review in this journal demonstrated that Prazosin, an alpha blocker, was a preferred pharmacological treatment for PTN and imagery rescripting therapy (IRT) was a preferred non-pharmacological treatment. Since that time, new and important research findings create the need for an updated review.; Recent Findings: Based on the results of a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Prazosin has been downgraded by both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Veterans Health Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) for PTN. In Canada, Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, appears to be promising. Few recent studies have been published on non-pharmacological interventions for PTN; however, recent data is available with regard to using IRT on an inpatient setting, with German combat veterans, and through the use of virtual technology. Recent evidence supports the use of exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT) with children and individuals with comorbid bipolar disorder and PTN. Prazosin is no longer considered a first-line pharmacological intervention for PTN by AASM and VA/DoD. However, in the absence of a suitable alternative, it will likely remain the preferred option of prescribers. IRT and ERRT remain preferred non-pharmacological treatments of PTN. Combining cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) with IRT or ERRT may lead to improved outcomes.; Imagery rehearsal therapy, Nightmares, PTSD, Prazosin, Trauma, Trauma nightmare, Traumatic","Waltman, Scott H.; Shearer, David & Moore, Bret A.",0,1476
1477,"Binge drinking and associated factors among school students: a cross-sectional study in Zhejiang Province, China","Objective: To investigate the prevalence and correlating factors of binge drinking among middle and high school students in Zhejiang Province, China.; Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from a school-based survey. A total of 23 543 (response rate=97.5%) eligible adolescents from 442 different schools (including middle schools, academic high schools and vocational high schools) were asked to fill in an anonymous self-administered behaviour questionnaire between April and May 2017. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of sociodemographic and behavioural factors with binge drinking.; Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 15.6 (1.7) years and 51.3% were boys. The proportions of students from middle schools, academic high schools and vocational high schools were 51.9%, 27.5% and 20.6%, respectively. In total, 22.8% (95% CI 21.6 to 23.9) of students reported drinking alcohol in the past 30 days and 9.2% (95% CI 8.5 to 10.0) of students reported binge drinking (defined as drinking four or more alcoholic drinks in 1-2â€‰hours period among girls and five or more alcoholic drinks among boys) during the past month. The prevalence of binge drinking was highest among vocational high school students (17.9% vs 6.3% and 7.7% among middle school and academic high school students, respectively). Older age, studying at high school, poor academic performance, higher levels of physical activity, excessive screen-time, loneliness, insomnia, previous suicide attempt, cigarette smoking, fighting, being bullied and sexual experience were found to be positively associated with adolescent binge drinking.; Conclusions: Binge drinking is common among middle and high school students in Zhejiang, China. Efforts to prevent binge drinking may need to address a cluster of sociodemographic and behavioural factors. Our findings provide information to enable healthcare providers to identify students at high-risk of binge drinking and to inform planning of intervention measures for at-risk students.; Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

1478,Pre-deployment insomnia is associated with post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation in US Army soldiers,"Study Objectives: Insomnia is prevalent among military personnel and may increase risk of mental disorders and suicidal ideation. This study examined associations of pre-deployment insomnia with post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal ideation among US Army soldiers.; Methods: Soldiers from three Brigade Combat Teams completed surveys 1-2 months before deploying to Afghanistan in 2012 (T0), on return from deployment (T1), 3 months later (T2), and 9 months later (T3). Logistic regression was performed to estimate associations of pre-deployment (T0) insomnia with post-deployment (T2 or T3) PTSD and suicidal ideation among respondents who completed surveys at all waves (n = 4645). A hierarchy of models incorporated, increasing controls for pre-deployment risk factors and deployment experiences.; Results: Pre-deployment insomnia was associated with increased risk of post-deployment PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.58% to 3.82%, p < .0005) and suicidal ideation (AOR = 2.78, 95% CI = 2.07% to 3.74%, p < .0005) in models adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and prior deployment history. Adjustment for other pre-deployment risk factors and deployment experiences attenuated these associations; however, insomnia remained significantly associated with post-deployment PTSD (AOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.19% to 1.89%, p = .001) and suicidal ideation (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.04% to 1.95%, p = .027). Subgroup models showed that pre-deployment insomnia was associated with incident PTSD (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.17% to 2.07%, p = .003) and suicidal ideation (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.16% to 2.40%, p = .006) among soldiers with no pre-deployment history of these problems.; Conclusions: Pre-deployment insomnia contributed to prediction of post-deployment PTSD and suicidal ideation in Army soldiers, suggesting that detection of insomnia could facilitate targeting of risk mitigation programs. Future studies should investigate whether treatment of insomnia helps prevent PTSD and suicidal ideation among deployed service members.; ","Wang, Hohui E.; Campbell-Sills, Laura; Kessler, Ronald C.; Sun, Xiaoying; Heeringa, Steven G.; Nock, Matthew K.; Ursano, Robert J.; Jain, Sonia & Stein, Murray B.",1,1478
1479,The mediating effects of depressive symptoms and sleep quality on the relationship between the non-medical use of prescription drugs and suicidal behaviors among Chinese adolescents,"Background: The nature of the relationship between the non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) and suicide has not been clearly elucidated. Some studies have suggested that the relationship between substance use and suicidal ideation may be spurious and could be explained by other variables. Methods: A school-based cross-sectional study was performed in Guangzhou. A total of 5853 students completed questionnaires and were included in the study. NMUPD, alcohol use, illicit drug use, depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and suicidal behaviors were assessed. The mediating effects of depressive symptoms and sleep quality on the relationship between NMUPD and suicidal behaviors were examined using a structural equation model. Results: In the simple model without mediation, a positive relationship between NMUPD and suicidal behaviors in adolescents was found, which was independent of effects from the use of other substances. Both depressive symptoms and sleep quality were significant mediators of this relationship. Conclusion: Public health and educational professionals should survey depressive symptoms and sleep quality and provide interventions when managing suicidal behaviors among adolescents engaging in NMUPD.

1480,Perceived racial discrimination on the change of suicide risk among ethnic minorities in the united states,"Objective: Suicide ideation and attempts are serious public health concerns in the U.S. Previous studies focus mainly on individual factors that cause suicide and therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of the environment on the onset of suicide risk. This study explored the effects of perceived race/ethnicity-based discrimination (PD; perceived institutional discrimination and perceived interpersonal discrimination) on the change in suicidal thoughts and attempts among racial/ethnic minority (REM) participants at risk for depression over time using a longitudinal nationally representative dataset.Design and methods: The sample consisted a total of 1,253 REM participants from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 1 and 2 datasets. Participants were categorized into three conditions: (1) no suicidal thoughts/attempts at Wave 1, who were at risk for onset of suicidal thoughts at Wave 2, (2) no suicidal thoughts/attempts at Wave 1, who were at risk for onset of both suicidal thoughts and attempts at Wave 2, and (3) had suicidal thoughts but no attempts at Wave 1, who were at risk for initiating suicidal attempt at Wave 2. Three logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between PD and the three suicidal conditions, controlling for sociodemographic factors.Results: Regression results showed that perceived institutional discrimination predicted onset of suicidal thoughts for Condition 1 (OR = 1.67, 95% CI:1.05â€“2.66) and initiation of suicidal attempts for Condition 2 (OR = 2.67, 95% CI:1.30â€“5.48), whereas perceived interpersonal discrimination predicted onset of suicidal thoughts and attempts for Condition 1 (OR = 2.34, 95% CI:1.17â€“4.66).Conclusions: PD may have detrimental effects on suicidal behaviors among REM individuals with depressive symptoms. Development of suicide prevention programs needs to take into account PD and be specific for different at-risk groups. This also foregrounds the importance of promoting anti-discrimination policies/programs as a suicide preventive intervention for REM individuals with depressive symptoms.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation among college students in Jilin Province, China, and to analyse the risk factors associated with suicidal ideation.; Methods: A total of 6284 valid data collection sheets were collected using the stratified cluster sampling method. The data collected were divided into four sections, namely, socio-demographic information, family and social interactions, daily habits, and mental health self-rating scales.; Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months was 9.2%. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being a senior (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.769, 95%CI:1.225-2.555), general family relationships (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.641, 95%CI:1.172-2.298), frequent parental quarrels (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.398, 95%CI:1.027-1.902)/parental separation (ORâ€¯=â€¯2.497, 95%CI:1.414-4.408), the level of satisfaction with motherly love (ORâ€¯=â€¯2.261, 95%CI:1.454-3.515), having only one or two friend(s) (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.530, 95%CI:1.038-2.254), frequent excursions to bars/ karaoke halls/ song and dance halls (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.673, 95%CI:1.257-2.229) or billiard halls with friends (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.865, 95%CI:1.270-2.740), smoking (ORâ€¯=â€¯2.175, 95%CI:1.603-2.951), moderate sleep quality (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.636, 95%CI:1.115-2.402), and depressive symptoms (ORâ€¯=â€¯2.078, 95%CI: 1.710-2.525) were risk factors for suicidal ideation. Family factors had the most influence on suicidal ideation, whereas depression symptoms were identified to be a mediating factor between family, social interactions, or daily habits and suicidal ideation, and it only exerted direct effects.; Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot provide causal interpretations.; Conclusion: Our findings showed the prevalence of suicidal ideation among college students in Jilin province. Among all the risk factors associated with suicidal ideation, family factors should be the main concern in the prevention of suicidal ideation, and interventions that target depression symptoms are key to reducing suicidal ideation.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The study aimed to expand current understanding of the diagnostic overlap of pain and PTSD and explore their independent and interactive effect on career change, sleep disorder and suicide ideation. The role of anger and hatred as contributing factors to the persistence of pain and PTSD were also examined.; Methods: 125 victims of torture and massive violence identified in a household survey took part in the in-depth assessment. Socio-demographic data and information on trauma, emotional disturbance, injuries and medication history were collected. PTSD was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Pain was assessed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Margolis Pain Diagram.; Results: Nearly 95% participants experienced pain during the last 2 weeks, 47% were diagnosed with PTSD, 50% were taking medication against depression and anxiety. There is substantial overlap of pain, PTSD and emotional disturbance. Injury history, PTSD and negative emotions were related to the pain score and the number of pain locations. Anger, hatred or an inferiority complex particularly amplified pain experience. Headache was constant and especially prevalent in those with recent experience of anger, aggressiveness and hatred. The risk of having chest and abdominal pain within 2 weeks was very high in those who had chest injury and had recently been crying. An increased risk of changing jobs or stopping work or schooling due to depression or injury was observed for those with a higher pain score, and for pain in neck, shoulder and upper limbs. The prevalence of sleep disorders was 80%, that of suicide ideation 70%, and these were found to be associated with greater pain and anger. PTSD was also related to suicide ideation.; Conclusions: The findings provide an overview of pain characteristics in individuals with PTSD and injury and confirm the hypothesized effects on career outcome, sleep disorders and suicide ideation. The study revealed a high level of persistent anger and hatred. The findings suggest the need for new approaches to rehabilitation in a post-war setting, including ways in which to address collective emotional hurt in the society.; ","Wang, Shr-Jie; Rushiti, Feride; Sejdiu, Xhevdet; Pacolli, Sebahate; Gashi, Besart; Salihu, Florentina & Modvig, Jens",1,1482
1483,"Safety overview of postmarketing and clinical experience of sodium oxybate (Xyrem): abuse, misuse, dependence, and diversion","Study Objectives: This study reviewed the cumulative postmarketing and clinical safety experience with sodium oxybate (Xyrem), a treatment approved for cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Study objectives were to investigate the occurrence of abuse/misuse of sodium oxybate since first market introduction in 2002, classify cases using DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse and dependence, and describe specific characteristics of these cases.; Methods: We retrospectively reviewed postmarketing spontaneous adverse event (AE) reports from 15 countries for all cases containing reporting terminology related to abuse/misuse to determine its occurrence. All death cases independent of causality were reviewed to identify associated risk factors.; Results: Approximately 26,000 patients worldwide received sodium oxybate from first market introduction in 2002 through March 2008. Of those 26,000 patients, 0.2% reported > or = 1 of the events studied. These included 10 cases (0.039%) meeting DSM-IV abuse criteria, 4 cases (0.016%) meeting DSM-IV dependence criteria, 8 cases (0.031%, including 3 of the previous 4) with withdrawal symptoms reported after discontinuation of sodium oxybate, 2 confirmed cases (0.008%) of sodium oxybate-facilitated sexual assault, 8 cases (0.031%) of overdose with suicidal intent, 21 deaths (0.08%) in patients receiving sodium oxybate treatment with 1 death known to be related to sodium oxybate, and 3 cases (0.01%) of traffic accidents involving drivers taking sodium oxybate. During this period, approximately 600,000 bottles of sodium oxybate were distributed, and 5 incidents (0.0009%) of diversion were reported.; Conclusion: Cumulative postmarketing and clinical experience indicates a very low risk of abuse/misuse of sodium oxybate.;Central Nervous System Depressants/*adverse effects, Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/*drug therapy, Sodium Oxybate/*adverse effects, Accidents, Traffic/statistics & numerical data, Drug Overdose/epidemiology, Drug Utilization, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Humans, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing, Rape/statistics & numerical data, Risk, Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology","Wang, Y Grace; Swick, Todd J; Carter, Lawrence P; Thorpy, Michael J & Benowitz, Neal L",0,1483
1484,Examining components of emotion regulation in relation to sleep problems and suicide risk,"Background: Sleep has emerged as an important factor in elevated risk for suicide and suicidal behaviors; however, the mechanisms accounting for this relationship are poorly understood. Emotion regulation is a well-established correlate of self-injurious behaviors; however, the broad construct has recently been shown to provide limited predictive utility. More nuanced investigations into the processes involved in emotion regulation may address this gap. This study sought to examine the mediating role of emotion regulation between sleep disturbances and suicide risk, as well as to evaluate a moderated mediation model in which down- and up-regulation of emotions would moderate this mediation. Methods: Participants were 972 adults recruited from a crowdsourcing website (Amazon's Mechanical Turk) who completed self-report questionnaires regarding nightmares, suicide risk, and emotion regulation. Results: Emotion regulation mediated the direct effect of nightmares on suicide risk and suicide attempts. Downregulation of negative affect moderated the mediation of nightmares on suicide risk more clearly than upregulation of positive affect, and neither component of emotion regulation exhibited moderated mediation in the suicide attempt model. Limitations: Generalizability of our findings from an online community sample will need to be established with replication in other samples. Additionally, we used cross-sectional measures in our mediation models. Conclusions: Downregulation of negative emotions may be particularly salient in relation to the severity of suicide risk and, as a result, relative deficits in this area should be considered when making risk determinations.

1485,Early adverse events and attrition in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: a suicide assessment methodology study report,"Adverse events during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment are frequent and may lead to premature treatment discontinuation. If attrition is associated with early worsening of adverse effects or the frequency, intensity, or burden of adverse effects, interventions to maximize retention could be focused on patients with these events. Outpatient participants (n = 265) with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder entered an 8-week trial with an SSRI. At baseline and week 2, specific adverse effects were evaluated with the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events--Systematic Inquiry, and at week 2, the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating globally assessed adverse effects. Attrition was defined by those participants who left treatment after week 2 but before week 8. No specific week 2 adverse effect, either treatment-emergent or with worsening intensity, was independently associated with attrition. Global ratings of adverse effect frequency, intensity, or burden at week 2 were also not associated with subsequent attrition. Neither global ratings nor specific adverse effects at week 2 were related to patient attrition during SSRI treatment.

1486,Outpatient psychotropic medication use in the US: A comparison based on foster care status,"Using data from the Client/Patient Sample Survey, a nationally representative study of outpatient mental health service utilization, the prevalence and correlates of psychotropic medication receipt for youth who live with families and in foster care are compared. The medication rate is similar for both groups, with slightly more than one-third of youth treated with medication. Additionally, when medication is prescribed, it is the sole intervention provided for close to one half of each group, and the distribution of other services received (such as clinical case management and collateral services) is similar, regardless of living situation. However, the predictors of medication use differ for the two groups. Among foster care youth, only presenting problems of depressed mood, being withdrawn, and suicidality significantly increase the odds of medication; among youth with families, sociodemographic characteristics (male gender), and a range of clinical factors (disruptive behavior disorder, presenting problems of hyperactivity and sleep disturbance, prior mental health service receipt, and inpatient or residential care referral sources) increase the likelihood of medication. The conclusion that distinct sets of factors predict medication for the two groups was reinforced by results of multivariate analyses; foster care status moderates the association between medication receipt and only one of the correlates examined (gender). Implications, limitations, and areas for future research are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

1487,Gastrointestinal symptoms and autism spectrum disorder: links and risks - a possible new overlap syndrome,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically determined neurodevelopmental brain disorder presenting with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities, or persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. ASD is characterized by many different clinical endophenotypes and is potentially linked with certain comorbidities. According to current recommendations, children with ASD are at risk of having alimentary tract disorders - mainly, they are at a greater risk of general gastrointestinal (GI) concerns, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. GI symptoms may overlap with ASD core symptoms through different mechanisms. These mechanisms include multilevel pathways in the gut-brain axis contributing to alterations in behavior and cognition. Shared pathogenetic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms possibly linking ASD and GI disturbances, as shown by most recent studies, include intestinal inflammation with or without autoimmunity, immunoglobulin E-mediated and/or cell-mediated GI food allergies as well as gluten-related disorders (celiac disease, wheat allergy, non-celiac gluten sensitivity), visceral hypersensitivity linked with functional abdominal pain, and dysautonomia linked with GI dysmotility and gastroesophageal reflux. Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has also been shown to be involved in modulating GI functions with the ability to affect intestinal permeability, mucosal immune function, and intestinal motility and sensitivity. Metabolic activity of the microbiome and dietary components are currently suspected to be associated with alterations in behavior and cognition also in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. All the above-listed GI factors may contribute to brain dysfunction and neuroinflammation depending upon an individual patient's genetic vulnerability. Due to a possible clinical endophenotype presenting as comorbidity of ASD and GI disorders, we propose treating this situation as an overlap syndrome"". Practical use of the concept of an overlap syndrome of ASD and GI disorders may help in identifying those children with ASD who suffer from an alimentary tract disease. Unexplained worsening of nonverbal behaviors (agitation anxiety aggression self-injury sleep deprivation) should alert professionals about this possibility. This may shorten the time to diagnosis and treatment commencement and thereby alleviate both GI and ASD symptoms through reducing pain stress or discomfort. Furthermore this may also protect children against unnecessary dietary experiments and restrictions that have no medical indications. A personalized approach to each patient is necessary. Our understanding of ASDs has come a long way but further studies and more systematic research are warranted.; ""dysautonomia, epigenetics, food allergy, gluten-related disorders, gut-brain axis, microbiome","Wasilewska, Jolanta & Klukowski, Mark",0,1487
1488,The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on suicide treatment and prevention,"Suicide is a major public health problem in the WHO European Region accounting for over 150,000 deaths per year. Suicidal crisis: Acute intervention should start immediately in order to keep the patient alive. Diagnosis: An underlying psychiatric disorder is present in up to 90% of people who completed suicide. Comorbidity with depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders is high. In order to achieve successful prevention of suicidality, adequate diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment for the underlying disorder are essential. Treatment: Existing evidence supports the efficacy of pharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in preventing suicidal behaviour. Some other psychological treatments are promising, but the supporting evidence is currently insufficient. Studies show that antidepressant treatment decreases the risk for suicidality among depressed patients. However, the risk of suicidal behaviour in depressed patients treated with antidepressants exists during the first 10-14 days of treatment, which requires careful monitoring. Short-term supplementary medication with anxiolytics and hypnotics in the case of anxiety and insomnia is recommended. Treatment with antidepressants of children and adolescents should only be given under supervision of a specialist. Long-term treatment with lithium has been shown to be effective in preventing both suicide and attempted suicide in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Treatment with clozapine is effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in patients with schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotics are promising but more evidence is required. Treatment team: Multidisciplinary treatment teams including psychiatrist and other professionals such as psychologist, social worker, and occupational therapist are always preferable, as integration of pharmacological, psychological and social rehabilitation is recommended especially for patients with chronic suicidality. Family: The suicidal person independently of age should always be motivated to involve family in the treatment. Social support: Psychosocial treatment and support is recommended, as the majority of suicidal patients have problems with relationships, work, school and lack functioning social networks. Safety: A secure home, public and hospital environment, without access to suicidal means is a necessary strategy in suicide prevention. Each treatment option, prescription of medication and discharge of the patient from hospital should be carefully evaluated against the involved risks. Training of personnel: Training of general practitioners (GPs) is effective in the prevention of suicide. It improves treatment of depression and anxiety, quality of the provided care and attitudes towards suicide. Continuous training including discussions about ethical and legal issues is necessary for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.

1489,"Review of health and risk-behaviours, mental health problems and suicidal behaviours in young Europeans on the basis of the results from the EU-funded Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study","An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7th Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD Â± 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged .16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged .15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called 'invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised riskbehaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the invisible"" risk group with those in the high-risk group similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%) subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%) depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32% respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2% respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6% with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0% p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group the intervention empowering pupils called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression.

1490,"Sleep Disturbance, Activities of Daily Living, and Depressive Symptoms among Older Adults","Objective: Research suggests sleep disturbance plays a role in depression and risk for suicidal behavior (i.e., ideation, attempts, death by suicide). How sleep disturbance affects suicide risk is unclear and one's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) may help explain this relation. This study examined associations between sleep problems, ADLs, and either depressive symptoms or suicide risk among older adults. We hypothesized that ADLs would mediate relations between sleep problems and depressive symptoms and suicide risk.; Method: Participants (NÂ =Â 134; age â‰¥65) were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants completed questionnaires that assessed insomnia symptoms, nightmares, ADLs, depressive symptoms, and suicidal behaviors.; Results: Nightmares were associated with depressive symptoms and suicide risk but not independently associated with ADLs. Insomnia symptoms were associated with depressive symptoms, suicide risk, and ADLs. ADLs mediated the relation between insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms. The insomnia symptom-suicidal behavior relation and the nightmare-suicidal behavior relation were significantly mediated by a pathway containing ADLs and depressive symptoms.; Discussion: ADLs help explain how insomnia symptoms and nightmares confer suicide risk among older adults, either independently or in association with depressive symptoms.; Clinical Implications: Practitioners should attend to ADL performance when treating older adults with insomnia and depression.; Activities of daily living, depressive symptoms, insomnia symptoms, older adults, suicide risk","Webb, Christopher A.; Cui, Ruifeng; Titus, Caitlin; Fiske, Amy & Nadorff, Michael R.",1,1490
1491,The ultimate resignation: suicide and search activity,"This paper presents an integrative approach to suicidal behavior in terms of search activity concept. Search activity concept displays a broad and holistic approach to behavior, adaptation to environment, body resistance, brain amine metabolism, and REM-sleep functions. Search activity is defined as activity that is oriented to change the situation (or at least the subject's attitude to it) in the absence of a precise prediction of the outcome of such activity, but taking into consideration outcomes at all previous stages of activity. According to the proposed hypothesis, renunciation of search (a state opposed to search activity) leads to a feeling of helplessness, problem-solution deficits, inefficient coping, dreams that represent renunciation of search, and a drop in the activity of amines. All these factors further exacerbate the state of renunciation of search and elevate suicidal risk. In addition, the remnants of search activity are misdirected to self-defeating behaviors that increase mental pain and contribute to renunciation of search. This hypothesis integrates findings from a number of fields of study of suicidal behavior, resolves some paradoxes, suggests new lines of research, and raises suggestions for assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior.;Suicide/*psychology, Brain Chemistry/physiology, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Humans","Weinberg, I",0,1491

They completed self-report questionnaires assessing suicidal behavior, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, rumination, and impulsivity. Suicidal participants exhibited higher rates of depressive symptoms, sleep problems, expressive suppression, rumination, and impulsivity. A confirmatory factor analysis model revealed pathways to suicidal risk that showed no direct pathways between sleep problems and suicidal risk. Instead, sleep was related to suicidal risk via depression and rumination, which in turn increased suicidal risk. These results suggest that addressing sleep problems will be useful in either the treatment or prevention of depressive and rumination symptoms and reduction in suicidal risk.

The ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline to week 4 (primary endpoint) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score at week 4 (key secondary endpoint) were assessed using linear mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Other efficacy endpoints were changes from baseline to week 4 on the ADHD-RS-AP hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales and the percentage of participants categorized as improved on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. Safety and tolerability assessments were treatment-emergent adverse events, vital sign and weight changes, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale responses, and electrocardiogram results.; Results: Of 369 screened participants, 275 were randomized (placebo, nÂ =Â 91; 12.5Â mg/day of SHP465 MAS, nÂ =Â 92; 37.5Â mg/day of SHP465 MAS, nÂ =Â 92) and 236 completed the study (placebo, nÂ =Â 80; 12.5Â mg/day of SHP465 MAS, nÂ =Â 80; 37.5Â mg/day of SHP465 MAS, nÂ =Â 76). Least-squares mean (95% confidence interval) treatment differences at week 4 significantly favored SHP465 MAS over placebo for the ADHD-RS-AP total score change from baseline [12.5Â mg/day: -8.1 (-11.7, -4.4), effect sizeÂ =Â 0.67; 37.5Â mg/day: -13.4 (-17.1, -9.7), effect sizeÂ =Â 1.11; both pÂ <Â 0.001] and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score [12.5Â mg/day: -0.8 (-1.1, -0.4), effect sizeÂ =Â 0.68; 37.5Â mg/day: -1.2 (-1.6, -0.9), effect sizeÂ =Â 1.11; both pÂ <Â 0.001]. Treatment differences for the change from baseline at week 4 favored 12.5 and 37.5Â mg/day of SHP465 MAS, respectively, over placebo on the ADHD-RS-AP hyperactivity/impulsivity (both nominal pÂ <Â 0.001; effect sizeÂ =Â 0.56 and 0.91) and inattentiveness (both nominal pÂ <Â 0.001; effect sizeÂ =Â 0.70 and 1.19) subscales. At the final on-treatment assessment, the percentage of participants categorized as improved on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement was higher with both SHP465 MAS doses than with placebo (both nominal pÂ <Â 0.001). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported (>5%) with SHP465 MAS were decreased appetite, dry mouth, insomnia, headache, anxiety, initial insomnia, irritability, and bruxism.

The current study examines behavioral characteristics of a series of 10 participants ranging in age from 2 to 20 years with 19p13.2 microdeletions. Parents/caregivers completed a series of established behavioral measures which have aided the elucidation of the behavioral phenotypes of a number of genetic neurodevelopmental syndromes. All but the youngest two participants (aged 2 and 3 years) were verbal, ambulant, and classified as partly able"" or ""able"" with regard to self-help skills. Six of eight participants for whom a screening measure for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could be deployed met criteria for an ASD. Six of the 10 participants had displayed self-injurious behavior in the month prior to assessment eight had displayed destruction/disruption of property and eight had shown physically aggressive behaviors. Repetitive behaviors were prevalent in the sample (with all participants displaying at least one repetitive behavior to a clinically relevant level) as were problems with sleep.

1497,Excessive computer game playing among Norwegian adults: Self-reported consequences of playing and association with mental health problems,"Computer games are the most advanced form of gaming. For most people, the playing is an uncomplicated leisure activity; however, for a minority the gaming becomes excessive and is associated with negative consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate computer game-playing behaviour in the general adult Norwegian population, and to explore mental health problems and self-reported consequences of playing. The survey includes 3,405 adults 16 to 74 years old (Norway 2007, response rate 35.3%). Overall, 65.5% of the respondents reported having ever played computer games (16-29 years, 93.9%; 30-39 years, 85.0%; 40-59 years, 56.2%; 60-74 years, 25.7%). Among 2,170 players, 89.8% reported playing less than 1 hr. as a daily average over the last month, 5.0% played 1-2 hr. daily, 3.1% played 2-A hr. daily, and 2.2% reported playing > 4 hr. daily. The strongest risk factor for playing > 4 hr. daily was being an online player, followed by male gender, and single marital status. Reported negative consequences of computer game playing increased strongly with average daily playing time. Furthermore, prevalence of self-reported sleeping problems, depression, suicide ideations, anxiety, obsessions/compulsions, and alcohol/substance abuse increased with increasing playing time. This study showed that adult populations should also be included in research on computer game-playing behaviour and its consequences.

1498,PREPP: postpartum depression prevention through the mother-infant dyad,"Most interventions to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) focus on the mother rather than the mother-infant dyad. As strong relationships between infant sleep and cry behavior and maternal postpartum mood have been demonstrated by previous research, interventions targeted at the dyad may reduce symptoms of PPD. The goal of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum Parenting (PREPP). PREPP is a new PPD prevention protocol that aims to treat women at risk for PPD by promoting maternally mediated behavioral changes in their infants, while also including mother-focused skills. Results of this randomized control trial (RCT) (n = 54) indicate that this novel, brief intervention was well tolerated and effective in reducing maternal symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly at 6 weeks postpartum. Additionally, this study found that infants of mothers enrolled in PREPP had fewer bouts of fussing and crying at 6 weeks postpartum than those infants whose mothers were in the Enhanced TAU group. These preliminary results indicate that PREPP has the potential to reduce the incidence of PPD in women at risk and to directly impact the developing mother-child relationship, the mother's view of her child, and child outcomes",Werner EA; Gustafsson HC; Lee S; Feng T; Jiang N; Desai P; Monk C,0,1498
1499,Tolerability and safety of fluvoxamine and other antidepressants,"Selective serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the 5-HT noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, are mainstays in treatment for depression. The highly specific actions of SSRIs of enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission appears to explain their benefit, while lack of direct actions on other neurotransmitter systems is responsible for their superior safety profile compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Although SSRIs (and venlafaxine) have similar adverse effects, certain differences are emerging. Fluvoxamine may have fewer effects on sexual dysfunction and sleep pattern. SSRIs have a cardiovascular safety profile superior to that of tricyclic antidepressants for patients with cardiovascular disease; fluvoxamine is safe in patients with cardiovascular disease and in the elderly. A discontinuation syndrome may develop upon abrupt SSRI cessation. SSRIs are more tolerable than tricyclic antidepressants in overdose, and there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that they are associated with an increased risk of suicide. Although the literature suggests that there are no clinically significant differences in efficacy amongst SSRIs, treatment decisions need to be based on considerations such as patient acceptability, response history and toxicity.;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Fluvoxamine/*therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects, Body Weight/drug effects, Central Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced, Fluvoxamine/adverse effects, Humans, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects, Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/chemically induced, Sleep Wake Disorders/drug therapy","Westenberg, H G M & Sandner, C",0,1499

Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in outpatients with epilepsy, and relate this to sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. Method: Ninety-eight non-selected patients were evaluated. The subjects were classified as â€œsuicidal ideatorsâ€ or â€œnon-ideatorsâ€, based on their response to item 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 13.3% (Ï‡Â² = 50.46, p < 0.001). The differences between cases with or without suicidal ideation were statistically significant in relation to sleep quality (p = 0.005) and symptoms of depression (p = 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Our results revealed that depression and anxiety were associated with sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and suicidal ideation and that depression and sleep disturbance were good predictors of suicide in subjects with epilepsy.

Eligible participants were emailed a unique invitation to complete an on-line survey; 105 completed the survey.; Results: Twenty-seven percent had suffered mental illness during their lifetimes. Eighty percent used synthetic cannabinoids (SC), and 20% 'party pills'. Forty-seven percent of SC users used daily or more often. Other drugs used included alcohol (80%), cannabis (59%), 'ecstasy' (18%) and methamphetamine (15%). Fifty-eight percent of SC users were classified as SC dependent. The most common problems reported from SC use were: insomnia (29%); 'vomiting/nausea' (25%); 'short temper/agitation' (21%); 'anxiety' (21%); 'strange thoughts' (16%); and 'heart palpitations' (14%). The health services most commonly accessed by SC users were: a 'doctor/GP' (9%); 'counsellor' (9%); 'DrugHelp/MethHelp' websites (7%); 'Alcohol & Drug Helpline' (4%); 'ambulance' (3%); 'A&E' (3%); and hospitalisation (3%).; Conclusions: Frequent use of interim licensed SC products was associated with health problems, including dependency.

1503,Age-dependent symptomatology of depression in hospitalized patients and its implications for DSM-5,"Background: We investigated effects of current age and age at onset on symptomatology of depression with reference to proposed revisions in DSM-5. Methods: The study entailed medical records of 326 inpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, including 520 depressive episodes, with 113 first episodes lifetime. Subjects were divided into three groups: young-adults, middle-aged adults and older adults. Results: In young-adults, active suicidal ideation, lifetime suicidal attempts, irritability, anhedonia and persistent depressive symptoms between the episodes were more frequent than in the other groups. Among older adults, depression was associated with insomnia, hypochondriasis, somatization, decreased appetite, weight loss, memory impairment and decreased activity. The older age was not associated with higher number of previous episodes of depression, bigger severity or duration of a single episode or a different degree of remission. Early-onset depression was associated with more suicidal attempts. Limitations: The study was retrospective and the sample may be treated only as representative for hospitalized depressed patients. Conclusions: Age and age at onset are important factors influencing the course and symptomatology of a depressive episode. Depressive episodes with anxiety and with suicide risk severity are important specifiers that vary with the age at onset and/or age of the patient and should be considered for inclusion in the DSM-5 revision.

The behaviour problems and the psychomotor delay in preschool children with SMS are often more striking than the dysmorphic features and can serve as a useful clue to the diagnosis. We compare the behaviour with reported data. The behaviour problems in the three four year olds include very demanding behaviour, severe temper tantrums, hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, self injurious behaviour, sleeping problems and stereotypic behaviour. Head banging, hand, wrist or finger biting are present. Onychotyllomania is not observed. Insertion of objects in the mouth as well as excessive nose picking is very frequent, although polyembolokoilomania is not present. The so called self hug when excited is present in one child.

1505,The association between maternal-reported responses to infant crying at 4 weeks and 6 months and offspring depression at 18: a longitudinal study,"The purpose of the present study is to examine the association between maternal response to infant crying and the psychological health of the child in later life. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort, consisting of 15,247 pregnancies, 10,278 with exposure variables and 3201 complete cases were identified as having exposure, covariate and outcome data. Using a postal questionnaire, mothers were asked regarding their infant at 4 weeks and 6 months, 'If they cry what do you do?': (a) pick them up immediately; (b) if they cry, leave them for a while, and if they do not stop, pick them up; or (c) never pick them up until you are ready. Outcome was an International Statistical Classification-10th revision criteria (ICD-10) diagnosis of depression at 18 years for the infant. Offspring of mothers who at 4 weeks reported that they never picked their infants up until they were ready were more likely to have depression at 18 years (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.06, CI 0.95-4.47, adjusted for sociodemographic confounding variables). There was no evidence for an association at 6 months. Including adjustment variables reduced the strength of our association; an observed objective measure of maternal response rather than a self-report may have more accurately determined the mother's actual responses. There is some evidence for an association between maternal reporting of responses to infant crying at 4 weeks and risk of developing depression at 18 years. If this association is found to be causal, interventions encouraging mothers to represent and respond to their infants' emotional states may help prevent offspring depression.; Crying*, Maternal Behavior*/psychology, Mother-Child Relations*, Depression/*psychology, Mothers/*psychology, Adult, Child, Female, Humans, Infant, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Mental Health, Parents, Adolescent depression, Attachment, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Emotional regulation, Infant crying, Mind-mindedness","Williams, Catherine J.; Kessler, David; Fernyhough, Charles; Lewis, Glyn & Pearson, Rebecca M.",0,1505
1506,An investigation of anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,"Anxiety-related concerns are among the most common presenting problems for school-age children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in clinical settings. The current study examined the relationship between anxiety and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, sleep problems, and challenging behavior in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD, aged 6-17 years. Parental measures were completed by 109 parents of children and adolescents with ASD. Significant positive correlations were found between anxiety and GI symptoms, and anxiety and sleep problems. A hierarchal linear regression indicated that demographic variables, GI symptoms, sleep problems, and challenging behavior accounted for 34% of the variance in anxiety, with sleep, severity of self-injurious behavior, age, and diagnosis of intellectual disability emerging as significant predictors. The findings suggest that these factors should be considered during clinical practice as they may serve as important alerts for clinicians to consider assessing for anxiety disorders. Future research should investigate these variables further by examining their associations with specific types of anxiety disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

With its mission to review infant and child deaths so that information can be transformed into action to protect young lives the Committee has reviewed 341 deaths in South Eastern South Dakota since its inception in 1997. In 2012, 24 deaths of children who were residents of Minnehaha, Brookings, McCook, Moody and Union counties met the criteria and all were reviewed by the interdisciplinary membership of the Committee. The manner of 10 of these deaths was natural, six of which were the outcome of congenital or long term illnesses and four deaths were sudden and unexpected. There were no sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths in 2012, though there were four deaths of infants that occurred during sleep. One of these deaths was considered natural, the manner of two was considered undetermined and one accidental. In each of these four cases there were hazards in the sleep environment of the infant who died. Overall, there were 10 deaths due to accidents and this included one incident in which three children died in a house fire. Similar to previous years, there was one suicidal and one homicidal death of a child. The report provides data on trends in infant and child deaths for this region of South Dakota and provides the Committee's recommendations of community action that could prevent their future occurrence.;Accession Number: 24244981.

Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of depression and determine behavioral and social characteristics associated with depression among students attending a women's college.; Methods: We administered a cross-sectional Internet-based survey between April and May 2012 to students (n = 277) enrolled at a private women's college in the southeastern US. Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) instruments measured self-reported depression.

1509,Testing the interpersonal theory of suicide in chronic pain,"Objective: The interpersonal theory of suicide offers a conceptual framework for understanding suicidal ideation (SI) that may be applicable to individuals with chronic pain. The theory emphasizes the importance of 2 interpersonal constructs as precursors to SI: perceived burdensomeness (the belief that one has become a burden to others) and thwarted belongingness (a lack of social integration or connection). Our objective was to test the interpersonal theory of suicide in people with chronic pain. Methods: Hierarchical regression analysis was used in a cross-sectional study of 282 patients of an interdisciplinary pain clinic. The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation was the criterion measure of SI, and independent variables included both general and pain-specific predictors. Results: After adjusting for other known or putative risk factors related to pain and mental health, perceived burdensomeness significantly predicted SI, whereas thwarted belongingness did not. As expected according to theory, the interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness was also significant; perceived burdensomeness was a strong predictor of SI at high levels of thwarted belongingness, but only marginally at low levels. Other independent predictors were male sex, number of prior suicide attempts, and hopelessness. Discussion: These findings are in line with some, but not all, of the major predictions of the interpersonal theory of suicide. In general, however, they support the relevance of the theory for individuals with chronic pain.

Thus, in three studies, we attempted to discern whether anhedonia may be a key linking factor between anxiety and depression.; Methods: Three studies asked participants about their symptoms of anxiety and depression: in Study 1, 109 participants completed measures of anxiety, depression, activity avoidance, and perceived enjoyability and importance of avoided activities; in Study 2, 747 participants completed measures of anhedonia, anxiety, depression, and defensiveness; in Study 3, 216 participants completed measures assessing the same constructs as in Study 2 at four time-points (ranging 11 months in span).; Results: In Study 1, symptoms of anxiety and depression were positively related only in individuals who relinquished potential enjoyment due to their anxiety-related avoidance; in Study 2, the indirect effect of anhedonia helped explained how anxiety symptoms imparted risk onto depressive symptoms; and in Study 3, anxiety led to anhedonia and then depression over time and anhedonia led to anxiety and then depression at both 5 and 11 months.; Limitations: The manuscript is limited by the use of a student sample in study 2, cross-sectional methods in studies 1 and 2, and reliance on self-ratings.; Conclusions: Anxiety may devolve into depression through anhedonia, such that anxious individuals begin to lose pleasure in anxiety-provoking activities, which results in the development of other depressive symptoms.; Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

1511,"Sleepless in Fairfax: The difference one more hour of sleep can make for teen hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and substance use","Insufficient sleep is a risk factor for depression, suicidality, and substance use, yet little is known about gender, ethnic, and community-level differences in sleep and its associated outcomes, especially during adolescence. Further, much of the prior work has compared groups of teens getting plenty as opposed to insufficient amounts of sleep rather than examine sleep hours continuously. The present study examined adolescent weekday self-reported sleep duration and its links with hopelessness, suicidality, and substance use in a suburban community with very early high school start times. We utilized a large (N = 27,939, 51.2 % female) and ethnically diverse sample of adolescents from the 2009 Fairfax County (Virginia) Youth Survey, an anonymous, self-report, population-level survey administered to all 8th, 10th and 12th grade students in public schools in the county. High-school students reported an average 6.5 h of sleep per school night, with 20 % obtaining â‰¤ 5 h, and only 3 % reporting the recommended 9 h/night. Females and minority youth obtained even less sleep on average, and the reduction in sleep in the transition from middle school to high school was more pronounced for females and for Asian students. Hierarchical, multivariate, logistic regression analyses, controlling for background variables, indicated that just 1 h less of weekday sleep was associated with significantly greater odds of feeling hopeless, seriously considering suicide, suicide attempts, and substance use. Relationships between sleep duration and suicidality were stronger for male teens, and sleep duration was more associated with hopelessness for white students compared to most ethnic minority groups. Implications for intervention at multiple levels are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1512,"Linkages between insomnia and suicidality: Prospective associations, high-risk subgroups and possible psychological mechanisms","Insomnia can be lethal, increasing the risk of suicide and accidental death by overdose. In this review we present a synthesis of the literature investigating the insomnia-suicide link and the psychological mechanisms underpinning the association. Specifically, we review the findings of prospective epidemiological studies demonstrating the insomnia-suicide link in adult and adolescent community populations. Robust associations between insomnia and suicide are observed in clinically depressed and anxious populations, and there are indications across a number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that these linkages are attributable to a disrupted sleep pattern, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and nightmares, independent of depression and anxiety symptoms. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and chronic pain (CP) are highlighted as high-risk subgroups given the elevated rates of insomnia and suicidality in both conditions. Aside from the influence of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms, emerging evidence has identified impulsivity and emotional dysregulation as possible mechanisms driving the insomnia-suicide link in BPD, and catastrophizing and the sense of defeat/entrapment as potential cognitive pathways through which insomnia aggravates suicidality in CP. Screening for, and interventions that tackle, insomnia and these associated psychological mechanisms, offer a novel avenue for reducing suicidality across a range of clinical and non-clinical populations.

1513,The sleep phenotype of Borderline Personality Disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Aim: To delineate the sleep profile of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Method: A meta-analysis to synthesise findings on the objective and subjective sleep characteristics of BPD. Results: We identified 32 studies published between 1980 and December 2015. Meta-analysis indicated significant differences between BPD and healthy control groups across objective sleep continuity (sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency) and architecture (rapid eye movement latency/density, slow wave sleep) measures, and self-reported sleep problems (nightmares, sleep quality). Findings were independent of depression (in clinical and community populations), and concomitant psychotropic medication use. There were few significant differences between BPD and clinical (majority depressed) control groups. Conclusion: BPD is associated with comparable sleep disturbances to those observed in depression. These disturbances are not solely attributable to comorbid depression. Given growing evidence that sleep disturbance may exacerbate emotional dysregulation and suicide risk, treatments for BPD should explicitly address sleep problems. Future studies should utilise prospective designs to ascertain whether (and in which circumstances) sleep problems predate or follow the onset of the disorder.

1514,Individuals at high risk for suicide are categorically distinct from those at low risk,"Although suicide risk is often thought of as existing on a graded continuum, its latent structure (i.e., whether it is categorical or dimensional) has not been empirically determined. Knowledge about the latent structure of suicide risk holds implications for suicide risk assessments, targeted suicide interventions, and suicide research. Our objectives were to determine whether suicide risk can best be understood as a categorical (i.e., taxonic) or dimensional entity, and to validate the nature of any obtained taxon. We conducted taxometric analyses of cross-sectional, baseline data from 16 independent studies funded by the Military Suicide Research Consortium. Participants (N = 1,773) primarily consisted of military personnel, and most had a history of suicidal behavior. The Comparison Curve Fit Index values for MAMBAC (.85), MAXEIG (.77), and L-Mode (.62) all strongly supported categorical (i.e., taxonic) structure for suicide risk. Follow-up analyses comparing the taxon and complement groups revealed substantially larger effect sizes for the variables most conceptually similar to suicide risk compared with variables indicating general distress. Pending replication and establishment of the predictive validity of the taxon, our results suggest the need for a fundamental shift in suicide risk assessment, treatment, and research. Specifically, suicide risk assessments could be shortened without sacrificing validity, the most potent suicide interventions could be allocated to individuals in the high-risk group, and research should generally be conducted on individuals in the high-risk group.

1515,Sleep problems and suicidality in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication,"Objective: Links between sleep problems and suicidality have been frequently described in clinical samples; however, this issue has not been well-studied in the general population. Using data from a nationally representative survey, we examined the association between self-reported sleep difficulties and suicidality in the United States. Methods: The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess sleep problems and suicidality in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Relationships between three measures of sleep (difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, early morning awaking), and suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts were assessed in logistic regression analyses, while controlling for demographic characteristics, 12-month diagnoses of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, and chronic health conditions. Results: In multivariate models, the presence of any of these sleep problems was significantly related to each measure of suicidality, including suicidal ideation (OR = 2.1), planning (OR = 2.6), and suicide attempt (OR = 2.5). Early morning awakening was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 2.0), suicide planning (OR = 2.1), and suicide attempt (OR = 2.7). Difficulty initiating sleep was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation and planning (ORs: 1.9 for ideation; 2.2 for planning), while difficulty maintaining sleep during the night was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (ORs: 2.0 for ideation; 3.0 for attempt). Conclusions: Among community residents, chronic sleep problems are consistently associated with greater risk for suicidality. Efforts to develop comprehensive models of suicidality should consider sleep problems as potentially independent indicators of risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1516,Hopelessness as a Predictor of Suicide Ideation in Depressed Male and Female Adolescent Youth,"We examined hopelessness as a predictor of suicide ideation in depressed youth after acute medication treatment. A total of 158 depressed adolescents were administered the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) as part of a larger battery at baseline and at weekly visits across 6 weeks of acute fluoxetine treatment. The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) was administered at baseline and week 6. A negative binomial regression model via a generalized estimating equation analysis of repeated measures was used to estimate suicide ideation over the 6 weeks of acute treatment from baseline measure of hopelessness. Depression severity and gender were included as covariates in the model. The negative binomial analysis was also conducted separately for the sample of males and females (in a gender-stratified analysis). Mean CDRS-R total scores were 60.30 ± 8.93 at baseline and 34.65 ± 10.41 at week 6. Mean baseline and week 6 BHS scores were 9.57 ± 5.51 and 5.59 ± 5.38, respectively. Per the C-SSRS, 43.04% and 83.54% reported having no suicide ideation at baseline and at week 6, respectively. The analyses revealed that baseline hopelessness was positively related to suicide ideation over treatment (p = .0027), independent of changes in depression severity. This significant finding persisted only for females (p = .0024). These results indicate the importance of early identification of hopelessness",Wolfe KL; Nakonezny PA; Owen VJ; Rial KV; Moorehead AP; Kennard BD; Emslie GJ,0,1516
1517,Depression and suicidal behaviour: Psychopathological differences between suicidal and non-suicidal depressive patients,"After an introduction to the fundamental structure of suicidal tendencies, the frequency of suicidal behaviour is discussed in depth, in particular suicide and attempted suicides of patients suffering from depression in both the general population as well as patients undergoing clinical treatment. Particular emphasis is placed upon the question of typical psychopathology as a high risk factor, i.e., those psychopathological phenomena that separate suicidal from non-suicidal depressive patients. It is seen that special importance is attributed to thoughts of worthlessness, guilt, despair, depressive delusional symptoms, inner restlessness and agitation, panic attacks and states of anxiety, sleep disorders and previous suicidal behaviour.

1519,The prospective relationship between sleep problems and suicidal behavior in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,"Objective: Previous research has found a longitudinal relationship between sleep problems and suicidal behavior while controlling for depression and other important covariates in a high risk sample of adolescents and controls. In this paper, we replicated this longitudinal relationship in a national sample and examined whether the relationship was partially mediated by depression, alcohol-related problems and other drug use. Methods: Study participants were 6504 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (ADD HEALTH). Results: In bivariate analyses, sleep problems (i.e., having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep) at Wave 1 were associated with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts at Waves 1, 2, and 3 (W1, 2 and 3). In multivariate analyses, controlling for depression, alcohol problems, illicit drug use, and important covariates such as gender, age, and chronic health problems, sleep problems at a previous wave predicted suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts at a subsequent wave. In mediation analyses, W2 depression significantly mediated the effect of W1 sleep problems on W3 suicide thoughts. Moreover, W2 suicidal thoughts also significantly mediated the effect of W1 sleep problems on W3 suicidal attempts. Conclusions: Sleep problems appear to be a robust predictor of subsequent suicidal thoughts and attempts in adolescence and young adulthood. Having trouble falling sleeping or staying asleep had both direct and indirect effects (via depression and suicidal thoughts) on suicidal behavior. Future research could determine if early intervention with sleep disturbances reduces the risk for suicidality in adolescents and young adults.

1520,Insomnia symptoms and suicidality in the National Comorbidity Survey”Adolescent Supplement,"Objective: In this paper, we examined the relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidality in a national sample of US adolescents, while controlling for several psychiatric disorders that are known to be associated with suicidality. Additionally, we examined whether insomnia symptoms interact to affect any suicidality variables. Methods: Study participants were 10,123 adolescents between the ages of 13â€“18 from the National Comorbidity Surveyâ€”Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A). Results: In bivariate analyses, all insomnia symptoms (i.e., difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early morning awakening) were associated with suicide ideation, plan and attempts. In multivariate analyses, controlling for substance use, mood and anxiety disorders, as well as important covariates, difficulties falling and staying asleep had a significant relationship with 12-month and lifetime suicide variables while early morning awakening did not. Conclusions: Two of the three insomnia symptoms had a significant association with suicide thoughts and plan even after controlling for psychiatric disorders that were known to affect suicidality. Having trouble falling sleeping or staying asleep had both direct and indirect relationships (via substance use, mood and anxiety disorders) on suicidal behavior. Assessment and treatment of sleep disturbances may reduce the risk for suicidality in adolescents.

1521,"Sleep problems, suicidal ideation, and self-harm behaviors in adolescence","Objective: Previous research has found an association between sleep problems and suicidal behavior. However, it is still unclear whether the association can be largely explained by depression. In this study, we prospectively examined relationships between sleep problems when participants were 12-14 years old and subsequent suicidal thoughts and self-harm behaviors--including suicide attempts--at ages 15-17 while controlling for depressive symptoms at baseline. Methods: Study participants were 280 boys and 112 girls from a community sample of high-risk alcoholic families and controls in an ongoing longitudinal study. Results: Controlling for gender, parental alcoholism and parental suicidal thoughts, and prior suicidal thoughts or self-harm behaviors when participants were 12-14 years old, having trouble sleeping at 12-14 significantly predicted suicidal thoughts and self-harm behaviors at ages 15-17. Depressive symptoms, nightmares, aggressive behavior, and substance-related problems at ages 12-14 were not significant predictors when other variables were in the model. Conclusions: Having trouble sleeping was a strong predictor of subsequent suicidal thoughts and self-harm behaviors in adolescence. Sleep problems may be an early and important marker for suicidal behavior in adolescence. Parents and primary care physicians are encouraged to be vigilant and screen for sleep problems in young adolescents. Future research should determine if early intervention with sleep disturbances reduces the risk for suicidality in adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

1522,The impact of work environment on mood disorders and suicide: Evidence and implications,"The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence estimating an impact of occupational factors on mood disorders and suicide, and the efficacy of interventions. This review is based on literature searches using Medline and Psych INFO from 1966 to 2007 (keywords: work stress, job insecurity, job strain, shift work, violence, occupational health, mood disorders, depression, and suicide). To establish the relationship between occupational variables and mood disorders, we focused on clinically significant disorders rather than depressive symptoms. During the last decade, prospective epidemiological studies have suggested a predictive association between the work environment and mood disorders. Recently, increasing numbers of clinical trials have shown favorable effect size of intervention and suggested preferable return-on-investment results. However, low awareness and social stigma still decrease workers access to treatment. Mental health professionals in conjunction with employers have to devise a creative system to make the quality care being offered more accessible to employees. In addition, further outcome data is needed to evaluate the benefit of managing mood disorders in the workplace, and to foster awareness of positive implications for employees, employers, their families, and the society at large. In addition, the work environment, with its chemical (e.g. chemosensory factors, pollutants), physical (e.g. lighting, noise, temperature, outdoor views and activities), biological (e.g., chronobiological factors, allergens, infectious agents), psychological (e.g. demand-control, effort-reward balance), social (e.g. cohesiveness, support), and organizational (e.g. leadership styles) component should meet minimal standards, and may improve with striving towards the optimum.; ","Woo, Jong-Min & Postolache, Teodor T.",0,1522
1523,The importance of glia in dealing with stress,"Glia are starting to be accepted as the equal of neurons. Gliaâ€™s role in stress and disease as well as the latest glial modulators are reviewed. Environmental enrichment and exercise can increase intelligence, a buffer against stress, most likely via glial involvement. Cerebral dominance is also related to how glia respond to stress resulting in psychiatric illness. Glial effects on depression and schizophrenia are reviewed. Astrocytes, microglia, NG2 cells, and oligodendrocytes all contribute. Suicidal ideation can increase the permeability of the BBB resulting in the increase in serum levels of a glial protein S100B that has become a marker for the intensity of suicidal risk. Microglia form one of the bases of the inflammatory theory of psychiatric disorders. Minocycline, adenosine and cAMP inhibitors, such as PDE-4 inhibitors, have been used to modulate the microglia, with positive results in psychiatric illness. Controlling the microglia can even be protective against drug abuse. Recently a â€œglymphaticâ€ system has been discovered in mice that if applicable to humans means that we clean out our brains in sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

1524,Hopelessness mediates the relation between insomnia and suicidal ideation,"Introduction: A growing body of literature indicates that insomnia is related to suicidality. However, the mechanism through which insomnia correlates with suicide risk is unclear. The goal of the present research was to determine whether hopelessness, a robust predictor of suicidality, mediates the relation between insomnia and suicidal ideation (SI).; Methods: The present study used archival data from community-dwelling adults. Participants (n = 766) completed a Health Survey, two weeks of daily sleep diaries, and five measures of daytime functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). BDI item 2 was used to assess hopelessness, and BDI item 9 was used to assess SI. Criteria from the DSM-5 as well as quantitative criteria were used to identify participants with insomnia (n = 135).; Results: The analyses revealed that hopelessness is a significant mediator of the relation between insomnia and SI. After adding depression as an additional mediator, hopelessness remained a significant predictor of SI.; Conclusion: The present research suggests the need for clinicians to routinely screen clients who have insomnia for hopelessness and SI, and to treat hopelessness when it is present. Further research should address the limitations in this sample and should also consider other potential mediators of the insomnia-SI link.; Â© 2014 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.Frustration*, Suicidal Ideation*, Depression/*epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*epidemiology, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*psychology, Suicide, Attempted/*statistics & numerical data, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cohort Studies, Confidence Intervals, Depression/diagnosis, Female, Health Surveys, Hope, Humans, Incidence, Likelihood Functions, Male, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychometrics/methods, Risk Assessment, Sex Factors, Suicide, Attempted/psychology, Young Adult, hopelessness, insomnia, mediation, suicidal ideation","Woosley, Julie A; Lichstein, Kenneth L; Taylor, Daniel J; Riedel, Brant W & Bush, Andrew J",1,1524

Analysis of the data revealed that the symptoms that tended to improve relatively early during treatment were suicidal ideation, excessive guilt, and lack of appetite. Conversely, depressed mood, reduced interest, and hypersomnia tended to improve during the last 4 wks of treatment in about half of the responders. The tentative conclusion is that symptom improvement tends to occur in both cognitive and neurovegetative areas early in treatment as well as later.

1526,The insomnia and suicide link: Toward an enhanced understanding of this relationship,"Despite current knowledge of risk factors for suicidal behaviors, suicide remains a leading cause of death worldwide. This suggests a strong need to identify and understand additional risk factors. A number of recent studies have identified insomnia as a modifiable, independent suicide risk factor. Although a link between insomnia and suicide is emerging, further research is required in order to understand the nature of the relationship. Accordingly, this paper presents an overview of the insomnia and suicide literature to-date, and a discussion of two major limitations within this literature that hinder its progress. First, the classification and assessment of insomnia and suicide-related thoughts and behaviors are inconsistent across studies; and second, there is a lack of empirical studies focused on investigating mediators of the insomnia and suicide relationship. Suggestions are offered within this paper for future studies to address these issues and facilitate new developments in this important research area. Following these suggested lines of research will ultimately inform whether insomnia treatments, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, can be used to target suicide risk prevention and intervention.

Such interviews are critical for recommending individuals for follow-up assessment and care. To standardize the interview process, U.S. Army Medical Research Unit-Europe developed a structured interview guide, designed in response to both clinical requirements and research findings. The guide includes sections on depression, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder, anger, relationship problems, alcohol problems, and sleep problems. In addition, there is an open-ended section on other problems and a section for case dispositions. Data from a 2005 blinded validation study with soldiers returning from a 1-year-long combat deployment are included to demonstrate the utility of the structured interview.

1528,Airplane pilot mental health and suicidal thoughts: a cross-sectional descriptive study via anonymous web-based survey,"Background: The Germanwings Flight 9525 crash has brought the sensitive subject of airline pilot mental health to the forefront in aviation. Globally, 350 million people suffer from depression-a common mental disorder. This study provides further information on this important topic regarding mental health especially among female airline pilots. This is the first study to describe airline pilot mental health-with a focus on depression and suicidal thoughts-outside of the information derived from aircraft accident investigations, regulated health examinations, or identifiable self-reports, which are records protected by civil aviation authorities and airline companies.; Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study via an anonymous web-based survey administered between April and December 2015. Pilots were recruited from unions, airline companies, and airports via convenience sampling. Data analysis included calculating absolute number and prevalence of health characteristics and depression scores.; Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty seven (52.7%) of the 3485 surveyed pilots completed the survey, with 1866 (53.5%) completing at least half of the survey. 233 (12.6%) of 1848 airline pilots responding to the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and 193 (13.5%) of 1430 pilots who reported working as an airline pilot in the last seven days at time of survey, met depression threshold-PHQ-9 total scoreâ€‰â‰¥â€‰10. Seventy-five participants (4.1%) reported having suicidal thoughts within the past two weeks. We found a significant trend in proportions of depression at higher levels of use of sleep-aid medication (trend test zâ€‰=â€‰6.74, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and among those experiencing sexual harassment (zâ€‰=â€‰3.18, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) or verbal harassment (zâ€‰=â€‰6.13, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).; Conclusion: Hundreds of pilots currently flying are managing depressive symptoms perhaps without the possibility of treatment due to the fear of negative career impacts. This study found 233 (12.6%) airline pilots meeting depression threshold and 75 (4.1%) pilots reporting having suicidal thoughts. Although results have limited generalizability, there are a significant number of active pilots suffering from depressive symptoms. We recommend airline organizations increase support for preventative mental health treatment.

1529,A nationwide survey of the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of internet addictive disorders in Taiwan,"Background and Purpose: The American Psychiatric Association has published the diagnostic criteria of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in the 5th Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) for further studies to clarify IGD and related concepts of internet addiction. The study aims to investigate the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of internet addictive disorder (IAD) in the general population using the framework of IGD criteria.; Methods: A nationwide survey was conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interview of residents aged 15 and older selected by a stratified proportional randomizing method. The questionnaire comprised socio-demographic information, 9-items IAD (IAD-9) for identification of IGD and non-gaming IAD, the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, and questions about internet use and suicidal ideation.; Results: Among 2147 respondents (50.4% females), the one-year prevalence of IAD was 1.9% (1.2% for IGD and 0.7% for non-gaming IAD). People with IAD were characterized as: younger, unemployed or students, under recent psychological distress, with recent and lifetime suicidal ideation, and engaging in regular multiple online activities including gaming, shopping or video-watching. Logistic regression revealed that age and psychopathology including insomnia, depression and inferiority were significant predictors of IAD. High prevalence of psychiatric morbidity (27.5%) and lifetime suicidal ideation (34.2%) accompanied with very low psychiatric treatment rate were also identified.; Conclusion: Age and psychopathology were identified as major determinants of IAD. The IGD criteria in DMS-5 is applicable to identify the internet addictive problems that enhances early engagement for high-risk populations across the ages.; Copyright Â© 2018 Formosan Medical Association.

1530,Acute poisoning with the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid in N-methyl pyrrolidone,"Background: Imidacloprid [1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine, CAS 138261-41-3] belongs to a relatively new class of insecticidal chemistry, the chloronicotinyl neonicotinoid compounds. Animal studies indicate relatively low toxicity to mammals because they have resistant nicotinic receptor subtypes compared to insects, as well as protection of the central nervous system by the blood brain barrier. Despite wide usage, human exposure experience resulting in toxicity is quite limited.; Case Report: Here, we report a case of acute ingestion of an insecticide formulation containing 9.7% imidacloprid, <2 % surfactant, and the balance as solvent, N-methyl pyrrolidone. Clinical manifestation included drowsiness, disorientation, dizziness, oral and gastroesophageal erosions, hemorrhagic gastritis, productive cough, fever, leukocytosis, and hyperglycemia. The patient recovered without complication with supportive treatment and was discharged 4 days after ingestion. Follow-up barium upper gastrointestinal examination 1 month later was normal. Because moderate to high dose imidacloprid in animals causes central nervous system activation similar to nicotine, including tremors, impaired pupillary function, and hypothermia, it is unclear whether imidacloprid had a causal role in the patient's initial drowsiness and dizziness. It is more likely that the formulation ingredients, particularly N-methyl pyrrolidone, caused most of the clinical symptoms including minor central nervous system depression, gastrointestinal irritation, and hyperglycemia.;Imidazoles/*poisoning, Insecticides/*poisoning, Pyrrolidinones/*poisoning, Blood Cell Count, Dizziness/chemically induced, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nitro Compounds, Sleep Stages/drug effects, Solvents, Suicide, Attempted","Wu, I W; Lin, J L & Cheng, E T",0,1530
1531,Rapid and sustained antidepressant response with sleep deprivation and chronotherapy in bipolar disorder,"Background: The development of a rapid-acting and sustainable treatment for bipolar disorder (BPD) depression has been a goal for decades. The most widely documented rapid-onset antidepressant therapy is sleep deprivation (SD), which acts within 24-48 hours in 40%-60% of depressed patients. Conventional antidepressants usually require 2-8 weeks to meet response criteria. The delay, which may prolong suffering and increase suicidal risk, underlines the urgency of alternative treatment strategies. This study evaluates the combined efficacy of three established circadian-related treatments (SD, bright light [BL]), sleep phase advance [SPA]) as adjunctive treatment to lithium and antidepressants. Methods: Forty-nine BPD patients were randomly assigned to a chronotherapeutic augmentation (CAT; SD+ BL+ SPA) or to a medication-only (MED) group. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Results: Significant decreases in depression in the CAT versus MED patients were seen within 48 hours of SD and were sustained over a 7-week period. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the benefit of adding three noninvasive circadian-related interventions to SD in medicated patients to accelerate and sustain antidepressant responses and provides a strategy for the safe, fast-acting, and sustainable treatment of BPD.

1532,"Preclinical Pharmacology, Efficacy and Safety of Varenicline in Smoking Cessation and Clinical Utility in High Risk Patients","Smoking is still the most prominent cause of preventable premature death in the United States and an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Although the current treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion are effective, long-term abstinence rates are low. Mechanism studies suggest that the pleasurable effects of smoking are mediated predominantly by nicotine, which activates the brain reward system by activation of brain Î±(4)Î²(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Varenicline is a novel Î±(4)Î²(2) nAChR partial agonist and has been found to be even more effective than NRT or bupropion in attenuating smoking satisfaction and in relieving craving and withdrawal symptoms after abstinence. Thus, varenicline has been recently approved to be a first-line medication for smoking cessation in the United States and European countries. Varenicline is generally well tolerated in healthy adult smokers, with the most commonly reported adverse effects being nausea, insomnia, and headache. However, growing post-marketing data has linked varenicline to an increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms such as seizures, suicidal attempts, and depression, psychosis, as well as serious injuries potentially relating to unconsciousness, dizziness, visual disturbances, or movement disorders. Therefore, new safety warnings are issued to certain high risk populations, such as patients with mental illness and operators of commercial vehicles or heavy machinery. In particular, pilots, air traffic controllers, truck and bus drivers have been banned from taking varenicline.; ","Xi, Zheng-Xiong",0,1532
1533,Clinical features and treatment response of patients with major depression and silent cerebral infarction,"Previously, we reported a relationship between silent cerebral infarction (SCI), as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and late onset major depression. In the present study, we clarify the clinical features of the depressive phase of patients with major depression and SCI, and their response to antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Using clinical charts, we retrospectively examined patients with depression, who were first admitted for antidepressant pharmacotherapy. All patients were classified according to the MRI findings and the age on admission (older or younger than 50 years) into either the young SCI(-) group (n = 23), the elderly SCI(-) group (n = 27) or the elderly SCI(+) group (n = 20).The characteristics of the clinical features were evaluated at the time of admission, after 2 weeks of treatment and at the time of discharge using the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD). These data were compared between each patient group. No differences in the clinical features, as evaluated by HAMD, were observed between the three groups at the time of admission. However, the mean length of treatment was significantly longer and the treatment response, as evaluated by the total HAMD score, was significantly worse in the elderly SCI(+) group than in the other two groups, when examined after 2 weeks of treatment and at the time of discharge. The elderly SCI(+) group demonstrated higher scores in feelings of guilt, suicide, retardation and hypochondriasis than the young SCI(-) group and the elderly SCI(-) group after two weeks of treatment, and higher scores in early insomnia, late insomnia, somatic anxiety and hypochondriasis at the time of discharge. Our findings suggest that while the presence of SCI does not affect the clinical features observed at the time of admission, it does affect the treatment response to antidepressant pharmacotherapy.; Copyright 2001 S.

A survey of 538 high school students aged 16-17 years attending two academic schools was conducted. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Beck Depression Inventory and the Scale for Suicide Ideation were used to assess subjects' daytime sleepiness, depression and suicidal ideation. The mean score for daytime sleepiness was 8.52, which indicates a sleep deficit. Significant positive correlations were found between daytime sleepiness and depression, between daytime sleepiness and suicidal ideation and between depression and suicidal ideation. Gender and depression were significant predictors of suicidal ideation, accounting for 48% of the variance in this measure. Depression acts as a mediator of the relationship between daytime sleepiness and suicidal ideation.

1535,Age at onset of major depressive disorder in Han Chinese women: Relationship with clinical features and family history,"Background: Individuals with early-onset depression may be a clinically distinct group with particular symptom patterns, illness course, comorbidity and family history. This question has not been previously investigated in a Han Chinese population. Methods: We examined the clinical features of 1970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Analysis of linear, logistic and multiple logistic regression models was used to determine the association between age at onset (AAO) with continuous, binary and discrete characteristic clinical features of MDD. Results: Earlier AAO was associated with more suicidal ideation and attempts and higher neuroticism, but fewer sleep, appetite and weight changes. Patients with an earlier AAO were more likely to suffer a chronic course (longer illness duration, more MDD episodes and longer index episode), increased rates of MDD in their parents and a lower likelihood of marriage. They tend to have higher comorbidity with anxiety disorders (general anxiety disorder, social phobia and agoraphobia) and dysthymia. Conclusions: Early AAO in MDD may be an index of a more severe, highly comorbid and familial disorder. Our findings indicate that the features of MDD in China are similar to those reported elsewhere in the world. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1536,Suicidal ideation at 1-year post-stroke: A nationwide survey in China,"Objective: Few studies on suicidal ideation have been conducted in post-stroke patients in China. This national study examined suicidal ideation at 1-year post-stroke and explored its demographic and clinical correlates. Methods: A total of 1418 patients with ischemic stroke were included in 56 hospitals nationwide. Demographic, clinical characteristics and neuro-imaging information were collected with standardized instruments, including assessment of stroke severity, depression, cognitive impairment, stroke recurrence, physical disability and insomnia. Suicidal ideation was measured using item 3 of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Results: The frequency of suicidal ideation in this study was 6.6%. Multivariate analyses revealed that disability (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.09â€“3.05), stroke recurrence (OR = 4.13, 95% CI = 1.74â€“9.77) and insomnia early (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.03â€“3.39), middle (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.46â€“4.85) and late (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.31â€“4.19) at the 1-year follow-up and post-stroke depression (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.23â€“3.82) were significantly associated with post-stroke suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Post-stroke depression, disability, insomnia and stroke recurrence are possible risk factors of suicidal ideation that warrant attention in clinical practice.

1537,The association between problematic cellular phone use and risky behaviors and low self-esteem among Taiwanese adolescents,"Background: Cellular phone use (CPU) is an important part of life for many adolescents. However, problematic CPU may complicate physiological and psychological problems. The aim of our study was to examine the associations between problematic CPU and a series of risky behaviors and low self-esteem in Taiwanese adolescents.; Methods: A total of 11,111 adolescent students in Southern Taiwan were randomly selected into this study. We used the Problematic Cellular Phone Use Questionnaire to identify the adolescents with problematic CPU. Meanwhile, a series of risky behaviors and self-esteem were evaluated. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were employed to examine the associations between problematic CPU and risky behaviors and low self-esteem regarding gender and age.; Results: The results indicated that positive associations were found between problematic CPU and aggression, insomnia, smoking cigarettes, suicidal tendencies, and low self-esteem in all groups with different sexes and ages. However, gender and age differences existed in the associations between problematic CPU and suspension from school, criminal records, tattooing, short nocturnal sleep duration, unprotected sex, illicit drugs use, drinking alcohol and chewing betel nuts.; Conclusions: There were positive associations between problematic CPU and a series of risky behaviors and low self-esteem in Taiwanese adolescents.

1538,Experience of primary care services among early adolescents in England and association with health outcomes,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate adolescents' (11â€“15 years) experience of their general practitioner (GP), whether poor reported GP experience was associated with worse physical and mental health measures and whether poor previous GP experience was linked to lower utilization of these services. Methods: We used logistic regression to analyze data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study. Four aspects of recent care experience were studied: feeling at ease, feeling treated with respect, satisfaction with doctor's explanation, and feeling able to discuss personal matters. Five dichotomized measures of health status were used: ever self-harmed; fair or poor self-reported health; frequent (at least weekly) low mood; sleeping problems; or headaches. Results: Of 5,335 students, 4,149 reported having visiting their GP within the past year. Of these, 91.8% felt treated with respect, 78.7% felt at ease, 85.7% were satisfied with explanation, and 53.9% felt able to discuss personal matters. After adjusting for ethnicity, age, gender, and family affluence score, poor experience on any indicator was strongly associated with increased risk of self-harm (adjusted odds ratio range, 2.01â€“2.70; all p < .001); feeling low (AOR range, 1.53â€“2.11; all p < .001); and sleeping problems (AOR range, 1.49â€“1.91; all p â‰¤ .001). Poor experience on all indicators, except discussing personal matters, was associated with worse self-reported health. Conclusions: Nearly half of this large, national study of adolescents did not feel able to discuss personal matters with their doctor. There was a consistent, strong association between reported lack of good GP experience and poor health measures.

1539,The association between short and long nocturnal sleep durations and risky behaviours and the moderating factors in Taiwanese adolescents,"Sleep quantity and risky behaviours are important health issues in adolescents. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the association between short and long nocturnal sleep durations and a variety of adolescent risky behaviours, including suicidality, violence, regular alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, truancy, unprotected sex, tattooing and criminal record of theft in a large-scale, representative population of Taiwanese adolescents, and to examine the moderating factors for the association between nocturnal sleep duration and risky behaviours. A total of 8319 adolescent students in southern Taiwan were recruited into this study and completed the questionnaires. The associations between short and long nocturnal sleep durations and adolescent risky behaviours, as well as the moderating effects of depression and sociodemographic characteristics on these associations, were examined. The results indicated that short nocturnal sleep duration was significantly associated with all risky behaviours, and long nocturnal sleep duration was significantly associated with all risky behaviours except for suicidality. Meanwhile, depression, sex, age, and maternal education level had moderating effects on the association between nocturnal sleep duration and several risky behaviours. The findings imply that professionals should investigate the concomitant risky behaviours in adolescents with short or long nocturnal sleep duration.

Eight thousand eighty-five adolescents in Taiwan completed the questionnaires. The associations of aggression involvement and the level of aggression involvement with internalizing and externalizing problems were examined. Compared with the neutrals, pure aggression perpetrators and perpetrator-victims had higher risks for internalizing and externalizing problems and pure victims had higher risks for internalizing problems and theft. Differences in the risks for internalizing and externalizing problems were found among 3 groups with aggression involvement. Levels of aggression involvement increased the risks for some internalizing and externalizing problems. Sex differences were also found.

1541,Association between school bullying levels/types and mental health problems among Taiwanese adolescents,"Background: Few studies have compared the risks of mental health problems among the adolescents with different levels and different types of bullying involvement experiences.; Method: Bullying involvement in 6,406 adolescents was determined through use of the Chinese version of the School Bullying Experience Questionnaire. Data were collected regarding the mental health problems, including depression, suicidality, insomnia, general anxiety, social phobia, alcohol abuse, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity. The association between experiences of bullying involvement and mental health problems was examined. The risk of mental health problems was compared among those with different levels/types of bullying involvement.; Results: The results found that being a victim of any type of bullying and being a perpetrator of passive bullying were significantly associated with all kinds of mental health problems, and being a perpetrator of active bullying was significantly associated with all kinds of mental health problems except for general anxiety. Victims or perpetrators of both passive and active bullying had a greater risk of some dimensions of mental health problems than those involved in only passive or active bullying. Differences in the risk of mental health problems were also found among adolescents involved in different types of bullying.; Conclusions: This difference in comorbid mental health problems should be taken into consideration when assessing adolescents involved in different levels/types of bullying.; Â© 2014.Adolescent Behavior/*psychology, Bullying/*psychology, Crime Victims/*psychology, Mental Disorders/*psychology, Adolescent, Aggression/psychology, Anxiety/psychology, Depression/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Health, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology, Students/psychology, Suicide/psychology, Taiwan","Yen, Cheng-Fang; Yang, Pinchen; Wang, Peng-Wei; Lin, Huang-Chi; Liu, Tai-Ling; Wu, Yu-Yu & Tang, Tze-Chun",0,1541
1542,The associated risk factors for underweight and overweight high school students in Cambodia,"Purpose: Overweight and underweight are one of the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but little research on this area has been undertaken in Cambodia. Therefore, this study aimed to measure underweight and overweight and their associated risk behaviors among Cambodian high school students.; Methods: 3806 students (mean agâ€¯=â€¯15.65 years, SDâ€¯=â€¯1.80, age rangeâ€¯=â€¯11-18 years) from the 2013 Cambodia-Global School-based Student Health Survey were used to yield representative samples of the Cambodian students. Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed by students' self-reported height and weight. The substance use, depression, eating behaviors, suicidal ideation, and violence were examined as risk factors. The Chi-square and multinomial regressions were performed to assess the relationships between risk factors and BMI.; Results: The prevalence of underweight was 47.4% (Nâ€¯=â€¯1805, Maleâ€¯=â€¯23.3%vs.24.1%) and overweight was 2.3% (Nâ€¯=â€¯89, Maleâ€¯=â€¯1.0%vs.1.3%). The BMI was significantly controlled by age, gender, and body height. Both underweight and overweight students were significantly vulnerable to substance use, feeling depressed, and violent behaviors. Of the risk factors, shortest sleep was prevalent for underweight students while feeling lonely and suicide attempts were the critical risks for overweight students. The daily fruit/vegetable consumption and physical activity were good preventive factors of both underweight and overweight epidemics.; Conclusions: The risk behaviors of students appear to be strongly associated with underweight and overweight. Interventions targeting these risk behaviors may have the potential to reduce risks. Meanwhile, the preventive strategies should focus on vulnerable students who have poor academic performance, mental health issues and a history of violent experiences.; Copyright Â© 2018 Diabetes India.

1543,The pre-amputation pain and the postoperative deafferentation are the risk factors of phantom limb pain: a clinical survey in a sample of Chinese population,"Background: To provide an overview of phantom limb pain (PLP) in China. This includes the prevalence of PLP and possible risk factors.; Methods: In a retrospective study, telephone interviews were conducted with 391 amputation patients who underwent extremity amputations at a tertiary hospital in China.; Results: PLP was found in 29% of the amputees. Pre-amputation pain (ORâ€‰=â€‰10.4, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and postoperative analgesia (ORâ€‰=â€‰4.9, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) were identified as high-risk factors for PLP. 82.1% of PLP patients experienced pre-amputation pain. The average pain intensity of PLP was 5.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.2, with 31.9% having severe intensity. The effects of PLP on the quality of the PLP patients were as follows: 7.8% of the patients had to limit their daily life and 29.0% of the patients had to limit their social activities. 17.3 and 25.7% of patients experienced depression and sleeping disorder respectively, while 18.9% had loss of interest and even 16.1% of PLP patients had attempted suicide. No effective treatments were found in 78.9% of these patients.; Conclusions: PLP has markedly affected the lives of patients. Pre-amputation pain and postoperative epidural analgesia might be risk factors for the phantom limb pain after amputation.

1544,Relationship between Long Working Hours and Suicidal Thoughts: Nationwide Data from the 4th and 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,"Background: Long working hours are a worldwide problem and may increase the risk of various health issues. However, the health effects of long working hours on suicidal thoughts have not been frequently studied. Our goal was to investigate the relationship between long working hours and suicidal thoughts in the rapidly developing country of Korea.; Methods: Data from 12,076 participants (7,164 men, 4,912 women) from the 4th and 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used for the current analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for suicidal thoughts. Combined effects of long working hours and lower socioeconomic status or sleep disturbance were also estimated.; Results: Compared to groups who worked less than 52 hours per week, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for suicidal thoughts in groups who worked 60 hours or more per week were 1.36 (1.09-1.70) for males and 1.38 (1.11-1.72) for females, even after controlling for household income, marital status, history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, health-related behaviors, and past two weeks' experience of injury, intoxication, or acute or chronic diseases, as well as type of work. The combined effects of long working hours with lower socioeconomic status, or with sleep disturbance, were also significantly higher compared to participants who worked less than 52 hours per week with higher socioeconomic status, or with 6-8 hours of nighttime sleep.; Conclusion: In this study, long working hours were linked to suicidal thoughts for both genders. Additionally, the odds of those suicidal thoughts were higher for lower socioeconomic groups. To prevent adverse psychological health problems such as suicidal thoughts, a strategy regarding long working hours should be investigated.; Social Class*, Suicidal Ideation*, Work*, Adult, Female, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, Republic of Korea/epidemiology, Sleep, Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology, Socioeconomic Factors","Yoon, Jin-Ha; Jung, Pil Kyun; Roh, Jaehoon; Seok, Hongdeok & Won, Jong-Uk",1,1544
1545,Occupational noise annoyance linked to depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation: a result from nationwide survey of Korea,"Background: Noise, or undesirable sound, is one of the most common environmental stressors, and it can cause various health effects. Beyond the auditory consequences of occupational noise exposure, extra-auditory effects such as psychological problems have also been found. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the association between occupational noise annoyance and psychological symptoms, including symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation.; Methods: A total of 10,020 participants (5,410 men and 4,610 women) were included in the current analysis, using data from the fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess noise annoyance levels, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for psychosocial symptoms were calculated using multiple logistic regression models.; Results: Compared to the no noise annoyance group, ORs (95% CI) of the severe annoyance groups were 1.58 (1.12-2.23) and 1.76 (1.29-2.40) in men and 1.49 (1.05-2.11) and 1.41 (1.01-1.97) in women for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, respectively. The ORs (95% CI) for severe noise annoyance in those with less than five hours of sleep were 2.95 (1.46-5.96) and 2.05 (1.01-4.16) in men and women, respectively, compared with those with no noise annoyance and a sleep time of more than five hours.; Conclusion: Our study shows that occupational noise annoyance is significantly related to mental health, including depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation after controlling for individual and socio-demographic characteristics even with gender stratification. However, prospective studies with quantified noise exposure assessment were needed to elucidate the causality on the association between noise annoyance and psychological symptoms.;Public Health Surveillance*, Suicidal Ideation*, Depression/*epidemiology, Depression/*etiology, Noise, Occupational/*adverse effects, Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Odds Ratio, Republic of Korea/epidemiology, Risk Factors, Stress, Psychological/etiology","Yoon, Jin-Ha; Won, Jong-Uk; Lee, Wanhyung; Jung, Pil Kyun & Roh, Jaehoon",0,1545
1546,Sleep disorders and suicidal ideation in Japanese patients visiting a psychosomatic clinic in a university hospital,"The Japanese suicide rate has been increasing rapidly. This phenomenon may be potentially attributable to the increase in the incidence of several mental disorders such as depression. Sleep disorders are the most frequent physical symptoms observed in depression, and are considered to be common complaints in general medical clinics. The objective of the present study was to assess the relation between suicidal ideation and sleep disorders in the primary care setting in a psychosomatic clinic. Subjects were 231 new outpatients who visited the department of psychosomatic medicine in a university hospital, suicidal ideation, sleep disorders and other confounding factors related to their psychosocial environment were assessed by psychological tests using questionnaires, and by the patient's chief complaints. Depression and anxiety disorders were assessed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval with adjustment for all the relevant factors. In multivariate analysis, both insomnia and overall sleep disorders were statistically significantly or nearly significantly associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression and anxiety. This trend was clearer in patients without major depressive disorder than in those with a major depressive disorder. Both insomnia and overall sleep disorders were associated with suicidal ideation independently of depression and anxiety. Clinicians working in a primary care setting should therefore be cautious when dealing with these sleep disorders which may be signs of suicide.

We examined the onset of each of 15 symptoms in 53 patients with winter depression. Three symptoms had a risk of onset closely associated with the onset of the episode itself and may represent a core syndrome. The risk of onset for the remaining symptoms was unrelated to the onset and the course of the episode. The symptoms were equally likely to begin at any time during the episode and suggest a different pathological mechanism.

1548,Ethical Issues in Addressing Social Media Posts About Suicidal Intentions During an Online Study Among Youth: Case Study,"Due to the popularity of social media, researchers are increasingly conducting studies that monitor and analyze people's health-related social media conversations. Because social media users can post about any topic at any time, no known best ethical practices exist as to whether and how to monitor participants' posts for safety-related issues that might be unrelated to the study, such as expressions of suicidal intentions. This is a case study during a social media-based study on sleep and activity among freshman undergraduate students, where we by chance noticed that a student was using social media to express suicidal intentions. Although we connected the student to student psychological services in order to receive treatment, we encountered a number of barriers that initially prevented this from occurring, such as institutional review board and regulatory practices related to lack of experience with these newer types of studies. We discuss the implications of this experience for future research.; Â©Sean D Young, Renee Garett.

1549,Significant need for a French network of expert centers enabling a better characterization and management of treatment-resistant depression (Fondation FondaMental),"Background: Major depression is characterized by (i) a high lifetime prevalence of 16â€“17% in the general population; (ii) a high frequency of treatment resistance in around 20â€“30% of cases; (iii) a recurrent or chronic course; (iv) a negative impact on the general functioning and quality of life; and (v) a high level of comorbidity with various psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders, high occurrence of completed suicide, significant burden along with the personal, societal, and economic costs. In this context, there is an important need for the development of a network of expert centers for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), as performed under the leadership of the Fondation FondaMental. Methods: The principal mission of this national network is to establish a genuine prevention, screening, and diagnosis policy for TRD to offer a systematic, comprehensive, longitudinal, and multidimensional evaluation of cases. A shared electronic medical file is used referring to a common exhaustive and standardized set of assessment tools exploring psychiatric, non-psychiatric, metabolic, biological, and cognitive dimensions of TRD. This is paralleled by a medico-economic evaluation to examine the global economic burden of the disease and related health-care resource utilization. In addition, an integrated biobank has been built by the collection of serum and D samples for the measurement of several biomarkers that could further be associated with the treatment resistance in the recruited depressed patients. A French observational long-term follow-up cohort study is currently in progress enabling the extensive assessment of resistant depressed patients. In those unresponsive cases, each expert center proposes relevant therapeutic options that are classically aligned to the international guidelines referring to recognized scientific societies. discussion: This approach is expected to improve the overall clinical assessments and to provide evidence-based information to those clinicians most closely involved in the management of TRD thereby facilitating treatment decisions and choice in everyday clinical practice. This could contribute to significantly improve the poor prognosis, the relapsing course, daily functioning and heavy burden of TRD. Moreover, the newly created French network of expert centers for TRD will be particularly helpful for a better characterization of sociodemographic, clinical, neuropsychological, and biological markers of treatment resistance required for the further development of personalized therapeutic strategies in TRD.

Starting from 2009/10 academic year, 3328 Secondary 1 students in 28 secondary schools in Hong Kong participated in this longitudinal study (Mean ageÂ =Â 12.59Â years; SDÂ =Â 0.74Â years). All participants responded to a questionnaire that includes the Internet Addiction Test, Life Satisfaction Scale, and Hopelessness Scale on a yearly basis. Cross-lagged analyses based on three waves of data collected during three junior adolescent years showed that Internet addiction measured at Time 1 predicted poor life satisfaction and hopelessness at Time 2, but not vice versa. Similarly, Internet addiction at Time 2 predicted low life satisfaction at Time 3, and the cross-lagged effects of life satisfaction and hopelessness on Internet addiction from Time 2 to Time 3 remained non-significant. The findings support the thesis that poor personal well-being in adolescents is the consequence rather than the cause of Internet addictive behaviors. To improve quality of life and prevent suicidality in adolescents, strategies that help reduce addictive behaviors related to the Internet should be considered.; Chinese adolescents, Hong Kong, Internet addiction, Longitudinal design, Quality of life","Yu, Lu & Shek, Daniel Tan Lei",0,1550
1551,The association between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls,"Background: Menstrual cycle irregularity is common among adolescents and can induce mental health problems such as stress, depression, and suicidal ideation. We examined the association between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study was on 808 female adolescents (12â€“18 years of age) participating in the 2010â€“2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Psychological stress, depressive mood, suicidal ideations, suicide attempts, and psychological counseling were assessed through questionnaires and surveys, and hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The risk of menstrual cycle irregularity tended to increase, as the number of mental health problems increased (P for trend = 0.016). High stress levels, depressive mood, and psychological counseling were associated with increased risks of menstrual cycle irregularity (odd ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.88 [1.1â€“3.21], 2.01 [1.01â€“4.03], and 2.92 [1.16â€“7.34], respectively) even after adjusting for age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, hemoglobin level, monthly household income, weight loss attempts, age at menarche, and sleep duration. Suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. Limitations: Menstrual irregularity was evaluated based solely on subjectsâ€™ self-reports, which are subject to their subjective perceptions and appraisal. Cross-sectional design and retrospective data could not draw causal relationship. Conclusions: Positive associations were observed between mental health problems and menstrual cycle irregularity among adolescent Korean girls. More attention should be paid towards mental health, to improve menstrual cycle regularity and help prevent related chronic diseases later in life.

Little is known about the outcome of CHC patients who required early termination.; Methods: Of 617 treatment-naive CHC patients prescribed a 24-week protocol of peg-IFN/RBV, 29 (4.7%) patients who terminated treatment early at <20 weeks were recruited to evaluate the rate of and the factors associated with sustained virological response (SVR), defined as seronegativity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) R throughout the 24-week off-treatment follow-up period.; Results: The reasons for early termination were flu-like symptoms/signs (n=9, 31.0%), irritability (n=1, 3.4%), severe urticaria (n=1, 3.4%), insomnia (n=2, 6.9%), pulmonary tuberculosis (n=1, 3.4%/o), suicide idea (n=2, 6.9%), poor response (n=2, 6.9%), depression (n=2, 6.9%), unwilling to continue (n=1, 3.4%), mortality (n=1, 3.4%), gastrointestinal upset (n=1, 3.4%), pancytopenia complicated with cellulitis (n=1, 3.4%), anaemia (n=3, 10.3%), overseas work (n=1, 3.4%) and an unknown cause (n=1, 3.4%). Five (17.2%) patients achieved an SVR, comprising none of 16 HCV genotype-1 and five of the 13 (38.5%) genotype-2 patients (P=0.001). All sustained responders were HCV R seronegative at week 4 of treatment. The SVR rate among HCV-2 patients was 0% (0/1), 0% (0/2), 25% (1/4), 33% (1/3) and 100% (3/3) in those who received peg-IFN/RBV for 1-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15 and 16-19 weeks, respectively (P=0.019, chi2 with linear trend).; Conclusions: Based on this limited study, we observed that an SVR might be achieved in patients who required early termination of a 24-week regimen of peg-IFN/RBV, especially for HCV-2 patients with HCV R seronegativity at week 4.;Hepatitis C, Chronic/*drug therapy, Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage, Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use, Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage, Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use, Ribavirin/*administration & dosage, Ribavirin/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Hepacivirus/genetics, Hepatitis C, Chronic/virology, Humans, Interferon-alpha/adverse effects, Male, Middle Aged, Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects, Recombinant Proteins, Ribavirin/adverse effects, Treatment Outcome","Yu, Ming-Lung; Dai, Chia-Yen; Lee, Li-Po; Hsieh, Ming-Yen; Hou, Nai-Jen; Huang, Jee-Fu; Lin, Zu-You; Chen, Shinn-Cherng; Hsieh, Ming-Yuh; Wang, Liang-Yen; Chang, Wen-Yu & Chuang, Wan-Long",0,1552
1553,Factors of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17 items) at 2 weeks correlated with poor outcome at 1 year in patients with ischemic stroke,"There was fewer paper about the relation between the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17 Items, HDRS-17) factors and stroke outcomes. Our aim was to investigate the influence of total score and factors of HDRS-17 on outcome of ischemic stroke at 1 year. A total of 1,953 patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled into a multicentered and prospective cohort study. The HDRS-17 was used to assess symptoms at 2 weeks after ischemic stroke. The Modified Ranking Scale (mRS) scores of 3-6 points and 0-2 points were regarded as poor outcome and benign outcome, respectively. At 1 year, 1,753 (89.8 %) patients had mRS score data. After adjusting for the confounders, patients with a total HDRS-17 score of â‰¥8 had a worse outcome at 1 year (OR = 1.62, 95 % CI 1.18-2.23). Symptoms of suicide (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI 1.27-2.83), decreased or loss of interest of work (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI 1.38-2.58), retardation (OR = 1.74, 95 % CI 1.27-2.38), psychic anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95 % CI 1.26-2.34), and agitation (OR = 1.61, 95 % CI 1.08-2.40) increased the risks for poor outcome by >60 %, respectively. Depressed mood, somatic anxiety, somatic symptoms-gastrointestinal, and early insomnia also increased the risk for poor outcome by nearly 50 %, respectively. A total HDRS-17 score of â‰¥8, and suicide, decreased or loss of interest of work, anxiety, agitation, retardation, depressed mood, somatic anxiety, somatic symptoms-gastrointestinal, and early insomnia of the HDRS-17 factors at 2 weeks after ischemic stroke increase the risk for poor outcome at 1 year.

1554,Clinical Phenotype of Depression Affects Interleukin-6 Synthesis,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is not a single disease, but a number of various ailments that form one entity. Psychomotor retardation, anhedonia, sleep disorders, an increased suicide risk, and anxiety are the main symptoms that often define the clinical diagnosis of depression. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), as one of the proinflammatory cytokines, seems to be overexpressed during certain mental disorders, including MDD. Overexpression of IL-6 in depression is thought to be a factor associated with bad prognosis and worse disease course. IL-6 may directly affect brain functioning and production of neurotransmitters; moreover, its concentration is correlated with certain clinical symptoms within the wide range of depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between IL-6 synthesis and psychosomatic functioning of the patient.

1555,Polysomnographic diagnosis of sleepwalking: Effects of sleep deprivation,"Objective: Somnambulism affects up to 4% of adults and constitutes one of the leading causes of sleep-related violence and self-injury. Diagnosing somnambulism with objective instruments is often difficult because episodes rarely occur in the laboratory. Because sleep deprivation can precipitate sleepwalking, we aimed to determine the effects of 25 hours of sleep deprivation on the frequency and complexity of somnambulistic episodes recorded in the laboratory. Methods: Thirty consecutive sleepwalkers were evaluated prospectively by video-polysomnography for one baseline night and during recovery sleep after 25 hours of sleep deprivation. Ten sleepwalkers with a concomitant sleep disturbance were investigated with the same protocol. Results: Sleepwalkers experienced a significant increase in the mean frequency of somnambulistic episodes during post-deprivation recovery sleep. Post-sleep deprivation also resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients experiencing more complex forms of somnambulism. Sleep deprivation was similarly effective in 9 of the 10 patients presenting with a comorbid sleep disturbance. Combining data from all 40 patients shows that whereas 32 episodes were recorded from 20 sleepwalkers (50%) at baseline, recovery sleep resulted in 92 episodes being recorded from 36 patients (90%). Interpretation: The findings support the view that sleepwalkers suffer from a dysfunction of the mechanisms responsible for sustaining stable slow-wave sleep and suggest that these patients are particularly vulnerable to increased homeostatic sleep pressure. Strong evidence is provided that 25 hours of sleep deprivation can be a valuable tool that facilitates the polysomnographically based diagnosis of somnambulism in predisposed patients.

1556,i just couldnt step out of the circle I was trapped': Patterns of endurance and distress in Chinese-Canadian women with a history of suicidal behaviour,"Rationale: Recent studies have highlighted higher rates of suicidal ideation and behaviour and associated themes of gender role stress in Chinese women residing in North America. However, qualitative studies, which privilege their voices in the discourse of suicide prevention and provide insight into their experiences, are lacking. Objective: To gain an understanding of the life histories, patterns of distress and constructions of suicide of Chinese-Canadian women with a history of suicidal behaviour. Methods: Ten women were recruited from four mental health programs in Toronto, Canada and participated in qualitative interviewing and analysis informed by constructivist grounded theory. Results: Chinese-Canadian women describe experiencing 'stress' or 'pressure' leading to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. Stress and pressure are managed through a coping strategy of endurance, informed by the cultural conception of 'ren'. Cultural influences contribute to the manifestation of stress and pressure as somatic symptoms and sleeplessness. Finally, the women describe feeling unable to endure through worsening distress, reaching a 'breaking point'; suicidal behaviour is constructed as a strategy to disrupt this cycle. Conclusion: This study challenges the binary notion that suicidal behaviour is either a consequence of mental illness or a reaction to interpersonal stress. Rather, the women describe an ingrained pattern of enduring through psychosocial problems without acknowledging worsening anxiety, depressive and physical symptoms. The pattern of endurance also prevents early treatment of these difficulties, resulting in the intensification of symptoms until a breaking point is reached. Knowledge of these patterns and coping strategies can allow for earlier identification and intervention for women at risk to prevent the worsening of distress leading to suicidal thoughts and behaviour.

1557,Screening for Depression using the PHQ-9 questionnaire: a study for Tunisian individuals consulting in the primary health care centers,"Introduction: Depression is considered a global public health problem especially in the developed countries, where depression is the leading cause of morbidity.; Objectives: To determine the point prevalence and the severity of depression in primary health care, to define the profile of patients suffering from depression and consulting in primary health care. To identify risk factors for depression, in particular chronic co-morbid conditions.; Methods: Our study was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study of 1000 patients aged over 18 years consulting in ten primary care structures. It took place during a period of six successive days from 8 to 13 April 2012. Depression was assessed by the 9-item-Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).; Results: In our sample, the average age was 42,4 years ranging from 18 to 89 years. Females were predominant with 66,6 %. According to the PHQ-9, the prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) was 12,1 %. It was higher among women (13,5%) compared with men (9,3%) with an odds ratio of 1,5. The highest prevalence of MDE (19%) was noted in the age group of 45-54 years. The most prevalent clinical signs found in our population were sleep disorders (29,7%) and suicidal ideation (28,4%). Among patients with MDE, only 10% were followed up for depression. Major depressive disorder was significantly associated with comorbid chronic diseases (p < 0,001), especially diabetes (p = 0,043, OR = 2,1), musculoskeletal diseases (p = 0,028, OR = 2,1) and pulmonary diseases (p = 0,001 , OR = 5,5). Having one comorbid chronic condition multiplied the risk of having a MDE by 2,2. This risk was 3,2 for two or more comorbid chronic conditions.; Conclusion: Depression in primary care remains a largely underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. Patients with chronic disorders are particularly vulnerable.; ","Zaibi Jomli, Rabaa; Ouali, Uta; Zgueb, Yosra; Smida, Malek; Zouari, Olfa & Nacef, Fethi",0,1557
1558,Neurobiology of Depression in Children and Adolescents,"Early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymic disorder are recurrent or chronic familial disorders that tend to continue into adulthood. They are often accompanied by other psychiatric disorders, such as substance use disorder and attention deficit disorder, that lead to poorer psychosocial and academic outcomes and may be complicated by suicidal behavior. There is the question of whether adult-onset major depression is the same illness as depression that starts in childhood or adolescence. Some of the neurobiologic systems, such as the serotonin and noradrenergic systems, which are implicated in mood disorders, evolve significantly during childhood and adolescence and may play a different role in pediatric- and adult-onset mood disorders. We review studies of the neurobiology of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Most studies of childhood and adolescent depression and suicide have followed up the observations and methods used in studies of mood disorders and suicide in adults. These studies include neuroendocrine studies, which look particularly at the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biologic markers, genetics, and sleep studies. In some areas, such as neuroimaging and postmortem studies, the number of studies is limited because studies that involve radiation are avoided in the pediatric age range and few postmortem brain samples are available in that age group. Understanding the neurobiology of depression and suicide in children and adolescents and comparing it to the adult population can identify similarities and differences between the two and potentially aid in development of new treatments and preventive strategies for this patient population.

1559,Convergent Mechanisms Underlying Rapid Antidepressant Action,"Traditional pharmacological treatments for depression have a delayed therapeutic onset, ranging from several weeks to months, and there is a high percentage of individuals who never respond to treatment. In contrast, ketamine produces rapid-onset antidepressant, anti-suicidal, and anti-anhedonic actions following a single administration to patients with depression. Proposed mechanisms of the antidepressant action of ketamine include N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulation, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneuron disinhibition, and direct actions of its hydroxynorketamine (HNK) metabolites. Downstream actions include activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, and activation of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). These putative mechanisms of ketamine action are not mutually exclusive and may complement each other to induce potentiation of excitatory synapses in affective-regulating brain circuits, which results in amelioration of depression symptoms. We review these proposed mechanisms of ketamine action in the context of how such mechanisms are informing the development of novel putative rapid-acting antidepressant drugs. Such drugs that have undergone pre-clinical, and in some cases clinical, testing include the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine, GluN2B-NMDAR antagonists (i.e., CP-101,606, MK-0657), (2R,6R)-HNK, NMDAR glycine site modulators (i.e., 4-chlorokynurenine, pro-drug of the glycineB NMDAR antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid), NMDAR agonists [i.e., GLYX-13 (rapastinel)], metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) antagonists, GABAA receptor modulators, and drugs acting on various serotonin receptor subtypes. These ongoing studies suggest that the future acute treatment of depression will typically occur within hours, rather than months, of treatment initiation.; ","Zanos, Panos; Thompson, Scott M.; Duman, Ronald S.; Zarate, Carlos A, Jr & Gould, Todd D.",0,1559
1560,Substance use as a risk factor for sleep problems among adolescents presenting to the emergency department,"Objectives:To determine correlates of sleep problems among adolescents. Specifically, to assess the relative strength of associations between sleep problems and dating victimization, reasons for emergency department (ED) visit, depression, unhealthy alcohol use, and other drug use (marijuana, nonmedical use of prescription opioids, stimulants, and tranquilizers). Methods: A total of 1852 adolescents aged 14 to 20 years presenting for care to the University of Michigan Emergency Department, Ann Arbor, Michigan, during 2011â€“2012, self-administered a computerized health survey. Sleep problems were identified if any of the 4 items on the Sleep Problems Questionnaire were rated by a patient as greater than 3 on a 0 to 5 scale. Adolescents who were too sick to be screened in the ED were eligible to participate in the study during their inpatient stay. Exclusion criteria for baseline included insufficient cognitive orientation precluding informed consent, not having parent/guardian present if younger than 18 years, medical severity precluding participation, active suicidal/homicidal ideation, non-English-speaking, deaf/visually impaired, or already participated in this study on a prior visit. Results: 23.5% of adolescents reported clinically significant sleep problems. Female gender, depression, dating victimization, tobacco use, nonmedical use of prescription medication, and an ED visit for medical reasons were each associated with sleep problems among adolescents, even while controlling for age, other types of drug use, receiving public assistance, and dropping out of school. Conclusions: These exploratory findings indicate that ED-based screening and brief intervention approaches addressing substance use and/or dating victimization may need to account for previously undiagnosed sleep problems.

1561,Correlation between family environment and suicidal ideation in university students in China,"Background: This study investigated the association between suicidal ideation and family environment. The sample included 5183 Chinese university students. A number of studies on suicidal ideation have focused on individuals rather than families. This paper reviews the general principles of suicidal ideation and the consequences resulting from the family environment.; Methods: This study used six different colleges as the dataset, which included 2645 males and 2538 females. Students were questioned with respect to social demographics and suicidal ideation factors. The data were analyzed with factor and logistic analyses to determine the association between suicidal ideation and poor family environment.; Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 9.2% (476/5183). Most participants with suicidal ideation had significant similarities: they had poor family structures and relationships, their parents had unstable work, and their parents used improper parenting styles. Female students were more likely to have suicidal thoughts than male students.; Conclusions: This study shows that suicidal ideation is a public health issue among Chinese university students and demonstrates the importance of considering the family environment when examining university students' suicidal ideation.

1562,Desaturase and elongase-limiting endogenous long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis,"Purpose Of Review: Endogenous synthesis of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) is mediated by the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster (11q12-13.1) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acids 2 (ELOVL2) (6p24.2) and ELOVL5 (6p12.1). Although older biochemical work identified the product of one gene, FADS2, rate limiting for LCPUFA synthesis, recent studies suggest that polymorphisms in any of these genes can limit accumulation of product LCPUFA.; Recent Findings: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Greenland Inuit shows strong adaptation signals within FADS gene cluster, attributed to high omega-3 fatty acid intake, while GWAS found ELOVL2 associated with sleep duration, age and D methylation. ELOVL5 coding mutations cause spinocerebellar ataxia 38, and epigenetic marks were associated with depression and suicide risk. Two sterol response element binding sites were found on ELOVL5, a SREBP-1c target gene. Minor allele carriers of a 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype in ELOVL2 have decreased 22â€Š:â€Š6n-3 levels. Unequivocal molecular evidence shows mammalian FADS2 catalyzes direct Î”4-desaturation to yield 22â€Š:â€Š6n-3 and 22â€Š:â€Š5n-6. An SNP near FADS1 influences the levels of 5-lipoxygenase products and epigenetic alteration.; Summary: Genetic polymorphisms within FADS and ELOVL can limit LCPUFA product accumulation at any step of the biosynthetic pathway.; Acetyltransferases/*metabolism, Fatty Acid Desaturases/*metabolism, Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*biosynthesis, Acetyltransferases/genetics, Alleles, Animals, Fatty Acid Desaturases/genetics, Fatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage, Genetic Markers, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Models, Animal, Multigene Family, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Zhang, Ji Yao; Kothapalli, Kumar S.

1563,Sleep patterns and mental health correlates in US adolescents,"Objective: To investigate systematically the associations of sleep patterns with a range of mental disorders and other outcomes among a nationally representative sample of US adolescents. Study design: Using the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of 10 123 US adolescents 13-18 years of age, we assessed associations between adolescent-reported sleep patterns (tertiles of weeknight bedtime, weeknight sleep duration, weekend bedtime delay, and weekend oversleep) and past-year mental disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, smoking, injury, suicidality, and perceived mental and physical health, assessed via direct diagnostic interview. Results: The average weeknight bedtime was at 22:37 and sleep duration was 7.72 hours. Average weekend bedtime delay was 1.81 hours and average weekend oversleep was 1.17 hours. Later weeknight bedtime, shorter weeknight sleep duration, greater weekend bedtime delay, and both short and long periods of weekend oversleep were associated with increased odds of mood, anxiety, substance use, and behavioral disorders, as well as suicidality, tobacco smoking, and poor perceived mental and physical health. ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.15. The only outcomes not associated with any sleep patterns were past-year injury and eating disorder. Conclusions: Suboptimal sleep patterns were associated with an array of mental disorders and other health-related outcomes among adolescents. Abnormal sleep patterns may serve as markers of prodromal or untreated mental disorders among adolescents, and may provide opportunities for prevention and intervention in mental disorders.

1564,Suicidality is a common and serious feature of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis,"We aimed to assess suicidality risk amongst people who had had anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. All people with a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in West China Hospital between June 2012 and February 2017 were identified and their notes were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics and risk predictors for suicidality were summarized; those with suicidality were compared to those without. 17 of 133 people (13%) presented with suicidality symptoms: 7 (5%) with suicidal ideation; 8 (6%) who attempted suicide; and 2 (1.5%) who completed suicide. Median age was 27 (16-78) years, most were female [13 (76%)]. Compared with those with no suicidality, psychiatric symptoms as the initial symptoms were more frequent in those who reported suicidality (pÂ =Â 0.039); insomnia, aggression, mania, depression and delusion were also more common (pÂ <Â 0.05). The use of antidepressants (pÂ <Â 0.001) and recurrence of encephalitis (pÂ =Â 0.020) were higher in people with suicidality than in those without. Other characteristics were not significantly different in those who had suicidality and those who did not. Suicidality is a common and potentially lethal risk for people with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Those presenting with psychiatric symptoms as the initial symptom and with insomnia, aggression, mania, depression and delusion should be carefully screened for suicidality.

1565,Prevalence and correlates of loneliness among Chinese service industry migrant workers: A cross-sectional survey,"Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers (MWs) who are employed in service industry are a rapidly growing population in urban China. Like other MWs, service industry MWs (SIMWs) are generally excluded from the mainstream of city societies, but unlike other MWs, they are more marginalized in cities. Social isolation increases the feelings of loneliness; however, there are little empirical data on the epidemiology of loneliness of SIMWs. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of loneliness among SIMWs in Shenzhen, China. By using respondent-driven sampling, 1979 SIMWs were recruited and administered with standardized questionnaires to collect data on sociodemographics, physical health, and migration-related characteristics. Loneliness and social support were measured with a single-item self-report question Do you feel lonely often?"" and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) respectively. 18.3% of SIMWs reported feeling lonely often.

1566,Childhood abuse and suicidal ideation in a cohort of pregnant Peruvian women,"Background: Childhood abuse is a major global and public health problem associated with a myriad of adverse outcomes across the life course. Suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality during the perinatal period. However, few studies have assessed the relationship between experiences of childhood abuse and suicidal ideation in pregnancy.; Objective: We sought to examine the association between exposure to childhood abuse and suicidal ideation among pregnant women.; Study Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2964 pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Childhood abuse was assessed using the Childhood Physical and Sexual Abuse Questionnaire. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for potential confounders.; Results: Overall, the prevalence of childhood abuse in this cohort was 71.8% and antepartum suicidal ideation was 15.8%. The prevalence of antepartum suicidal ideation was higher among women who reported experiencing any childhood abuse compared to those reporting none (89.3% vs 10.7%, P < .0001). After adjusting for potential confounders, including antepartum depression and lifetime intimate partner violence, those with history of any childhood abuse had a 2.9-fold (2.90, adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 2.12-3.97) increased odds of reporting suicidal ideation. Women who experienced both physical and sexual childhood abuse had much higher odds of suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.04; 95% confidence interval, 2.88-5.68). Women who experienced any childhood abuse and reported depression had 3.44-fold (3.44, adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-6.43) increased odds of suicidal ideation compared with depressed women with no history of childhood abuse.

1567,The long-term physical and psychological health impacts of flooding: A systematic mapping,"Background: Flooding has caused significant and wide ranging long-term health impacts for affected populations. However, until now, the long-term health outcomes, epidemiological trends and specific impact factors of flooding had not been identified. In this study, the relevant literature was systematically mapped to create the first synthesis of the evidence of the long-term health impacts of flooding.; Methods: The systematic mapping method was used to collect and categorize all the relevant literature. A study was included if it had a description or measurement of health impacts over six months after flooding. The search was limited to peer reviewed articles and grey literature written in English, published from 1996 to 2016.; Results: A total of 56 critical articles were extracted for the final map, including 5 qualitative and 51 quantitative studies. Most long-term studies investigated the psychological impacts of flooding, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, psychiatric disorders, sleep disorder and suicide. Others investigated the physiological impacts, including health-related quality of life, acute myocardial infarction, chronic diseases, and malnutrition. Social support was proved to be protective factors that can improve health outcomes in the long-term after flooding. To date, there have been relatively few reviews had focused on the long-term health impacts of flooding. This study coded and catalogued the existing evidence across a wide range of variables and described the long-term health consequences within a conceptual map.; Discussion and Conclusions: Although there was no boundary between the short-term and the long-term impacts of flooding, the identified health outcomes in this systematic mapping could be used to define long-term health impacts. The studies showed that the prevalence of psychological diseases had a reversed increasing trend occurred even in the long-term in relatively poor post-flooding environments. Further cohort or longitudinal research focused on disability, chronic diseases, relocation population, and social interventions after flooding, are urgently required.; Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

1568,Depressive phenomenology in regard to depersonalization level,"Background: It has been found that in patients suffering from unipolar depression, associated depersonalization symptomatology is more intense compared to healthy controls, and also that there is a positive correlation between depression and depersonalization. According to data that may be found in the literature, there is a relatively high prevalence of depersonalization symptomatology in unipolar depressions. Our study was aimed at finding whether the presence of depersonalization was related to a specific phenomenological expression of depressive symptomatology in unipolar depression.; Subjects and Methods: The study included 84 subjects suffering from unipolar depression without psychotic features. Based on the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) score, the subjects were divided into two groups - a group with associated depersonalization (CDS>or=70) (40 subjects) and a group with subsyndromal depersonalization (CDS<70) (44 subjects), the later one being treated as a control group. The groups were compared in regard to the intensity of depressive symptomatology, depressive symptoms frequency and the depressive symptoms duration. The General Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale and The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 were used.; Results: The depressive patients with depersonalization had predominantly severe episodes, almost all patients had feelings of sadness, insomnia, and decrease of energetic potentials. The biggest difference between the groups, in terms of greater number of manifest symptoms in the patients with depersonalization, was for psychomotor disturbances (agitation or retardation), insomnia, decrease of energetic potentials and concentration. At the same time, 75% of the subjects with associated depersonalization had anhedonia, sadness/dysphoria, insomnia and decrease of energetic potentials continuously present. Unlike this group, the control group subjects experienced sadness, appetite problems, concentration and motor behavior changes almost half as frequently. Particularly significant were the differences regarding suicidal thoughts. It was shown that in the group with depersonalization there was a higher percentage of patients with suicidal thoughts, mostly continuously present, which represent a significant suicidal risk factor.; Conclusion: Unipolar depression, associated with depersonalization is more severe in its intensity .It has a bigger number of manifest symptoms which have a tendency to continuous duration. A special focus is on the negative impact on the occurrence and lasting presence of suicidal thoughts.;Depersonalization/*diagnosis, Depressive Disorder/*diagnosis, Adult, Affective Symptoms/diagnosis, Affective Symptoms/epidemiology, Affective Symptoms/psychology, Comorbidity, Depersonalization/epidemiology, Depersonalization/psychology, Depressive Disorder/epidemiology, Depressive Disorder/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Personality Assessment/statistics & numerical data, Psychometrics, Suicide, Attempted/psychology, Young Adult","ZikiÄ‡, Olivera; CiriÄ‡, Snezana & MitkoviÄ‡, Marija",0,1568
1569,Diagnosing major depressive disorder I: A psychometric evaluation of the DSM-IV symptom criteria,"The diagnostic criteria for depression were developed on the basis of clinical experience rather than empirical study. Although they have been available and widely used for many years, few studies have examined the psychometric properties of the DSM criteria for major depression. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project, we examined whether criteria such as insomnia, fatigue, and impaired concentration that are also diagnostic criteria for other disorders are less specific than the other DSM-IV depression symptom criteria. We also conducted a regression analysis to determine whether all criteria are independently associated with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. A total of 1538 psychiatric outpatients were administered a semistructured diagnostic interview. We inquired about all of the symptoms of depression for all patients. All of the DSM-IV symptom criteria for major depressive disorder were significantly associated with the diagnosis. Contrary to our prediction, symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, and impaired concentration, which are also criteria of other disorders, generally performed as well as the criteria that are unique to depression such as suicidality, worthlessness, and guilt. The results of the regression analysis, which controlled for symptom covariation, indicated that five symptoms (increased weight, decreased weight, psychomotor retardation, indecisiveness, and suicidal thoughts) were not independently associated with the diagnosis of depression. The implications of these results for revising the diagnostic criteria for major depression are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

1570,Hospitalassociated functional decline: The role of hospitalization processes beyond individual risk factors,"Objectives: To investigate the combined contribution of processes of hospitalization and preadmission individual risk factors in explaining functional decline at discharge and at 1â€month followâ€up in older adults with nondisabling conditions. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Internal medicine wards in two Israeli medical centers. Participants: Six hundred eightyâ€four individuals aged 70 and older admitted for a nondisabling problem. Measurements: Functional decline was measured according to change in modified Barthel Index from premorbid to discharge and from premorbid to 1 month after discharge. Inâ€hospital mobility, continence care, sleep medication consumption, satisfaction with hospital environment, and nutrition intake were assessed using previously tested selfâ€report instruments. Results: Two hundred eightyâ€two participants (41.2%) reported functional decline at discharge and 317 (46.3%) at 1 month after discharge. Path analysis indicated that inâ€hospital mobility (standardized maximum likelihood estimate (SMLE) = âˆ’0.48, P < .001), continence care (SMLE = âˆ’0.12, P < .001), and length of stay (LOS) (SMLE = 0.06, P < .001) were directly related to functional decline at discharge and, together with personal risk factors, explained 64% of variance. Inâ€hospital mobility, continence care, and LOS were indirectly related to functional decline at 1 month after discharge through functional decline at discharge (SMLE = 0.45, P < .001). Nutrition consumption (SMLE = âˆ’0.07, P < .001) was significantly related to functional decline at 1 month after discharge, explaining, together with other risk factors, 32% of variance. Conclusion: Inâ€hospital low mobility, suboptimal continence care, and poor nutrition account for immediate and 1â€month posthospitalization functional decline. These are potentially modifiable hospitalization risk factors for which practice and policy should be targeted in efforts to curb the posthospitalization functional decline trajectory.

1571,"Adolescent insomnia, suicide risk, and the interpersonal theory of suicide","Although insomnia has been repeatedly linked with suicide ideation, the reason for the linkage is not clear. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) proposes that three core variables (thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability) are the final common pathway for all risk factors for suicide ideation and behavior. Recent research has suggested that insomnia may be associated with suicide ideation independently of the IPTS. We examined cross-sectional data from 151 psychiatric inpatients (ages 12â€“17) to determine if the association between insomnia symptoms and a continuous measure of suicide risk (measured as increasingly severe ideation and plan) was explained by the framework of the IPTS. When all IPTS variables and depressive symptoms were included in the model, insomnia symptoms did not contribute unique variance to suicide risk. Perceived burdensomeness and depressive symptoms were found to explain the relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicide risk. Our findings suggest that improved sleep might reduce suicide risk, that management of interpersonal need cognitions might reduce risk in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and reinforce the independent role of depressive symptoms in suicide risk in clinical samples of adolescents.

The current study addressed these limitations by utilizing a longitudinal design and advanced statistical modeling. Participants who endorsed lifetime experience of suicidal behavior were recruited through Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (N = 589) and completed self-report online surveys at 6 time points over a 15-day period. Latent difference score modeling was utilized to investigate whether levels and/or changes in insomnia symptoms drive subsequent changes in suicide ideation, or vice versa. Results revealed that previous level of insomnia symptoms was predictive of positive changes in suicide ideation (i.e., level of insomnia symptoms predicted lagged increases in suicide ideation).

1573,Lovastatin 5-year safety and efficacy study Lovastatin Study Groups I through IV,"Background: Inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. They have a good short- to medium-term safety profile, but long-term safety data are limited.; Methods: Seven hundred forty-five patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (mean baseline plasma cholesterol level on diet, 9.3 mmol/L [360 mg/dL]) were treated with lovastatin for a median duration of 5.2 years. Their mean age at baseline was 50 years, 68% were male, 60% had familial hypercholesterolemia, and 42% had a history of coronary heart disease. Seventy-seven percent of patients had titrations of lovastatin to 80 mg/d, and 58% took other lipid-lowering agents, usually bile acid sequestrants, concomitantly.; Results: The mean changes at 5 years in total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were -35%, -44%, and +14%, respectively. Eighty percent of patients completed the study, 13% were unavailable for follow-up, 4% were discontinued due to adverse events unlikely to be related to lovastatin, and 3% (21) were discontinued because of drug-attributable adverse events: marked but asymptomatic increase in aminotransferase values (10 patients), gastrointestinal disturbance (three patients), rash (two patients), myalgia (one patient), myopathy (two patients), arthralgia (one patient), insomnia (one patient), and weight gain (one patient). Sixteen patients died during the study, all of coronary disease. Of these, 14 had coronary heart disease at baseline. There were no deaths attributable to trauma, suicide, or homicide, and there were only 14 cases of cancer (vs 21 expected). There was no evidence for an adverse effect on the lens.; Conclusions: Lovastatin is a generally well-tolerated and effective drug during long-term use.;Hypercholesterolemia/*drug therapy, Lovastatin/*adverse effects, Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced, Cause of Death, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Lovastatin/therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Treatment Outcome, Visual Acuity/drug effects",,0,1573

The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame, and suicidal thoughts. Response to antidepressants (ATDs) is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to ATDs is more uncertain. The newer ATDs have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, are better tolerated, and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. ATDs should be used at full therapeutic doses. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 mo after the patient is apparently well.

1579,Adverse effects of cannabis,"Cannabis, Cannabis sativa L., is used to produce a resin that contains high levels of cannabinoids, particularly delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which are psychoactive substances. Although cannabis use is illegal in France and in many other countries, it is widely used for its relaxing or euphoric effects, especially by adolescents and young adults. What are the adverse effects of cannabis on health? During consumption? And in the long term? Does cannabis predispose users to the development of psychotic disorders? To answer these questions, we reviewed the available evidence using the standard Prescrire methodology. The long-term adverse effects of cannabis are difficult to evaluate. Since and associated substances, with or without the user's knowledge. Tobacco and alcohol consumption, and particular lifestyles and behaviours are often associated with cannabis use. Some traits predispose individuals to the use of psychoactive substances in general. The effects of cannabis are dosedependent.The most frequently report-ed adverse effects are mental slowness, impaired reaction times, and sometimes accentuation of anxiety. Serious psychological disorders have been reported with high levels of intoxication. The relationship between poor school performance and early, regular, and frequent cannabis use seems to be a vicious circle, in which each sustains the other. Many studies have focused on the long-term effects of cannabis on memory, but their results have been inconclusive. There do not * About fifteen longitudinal cohort studies that examined the influence of cannabis on depressive thoughts or suicidal ideation have yielded conflicting results and are inconclusive. Several longitudinal cohort studies have shown a statistical association between psychotic illness and self-reported cannabis use. However, the results are difficult to interpret due to methodological problems, particularly the unknown reliability of self-reported data. It has not been possible to establish a causal relationship in either direction, because of these methodological limitations. In Australia, the marked increase in cannabis use has not been accompanied by an increased incidence of schizophrenia. On the basis of the available data, we cannot reach firm conclusions on whether or not cannabis use causes psychosis. It seems prudent to inform apparently vulnerable individuals that cannabis may cause acute psychotic decompensation, especially at high doses. Users can feel dependent on cannabis, but this dependence is usually psychological. Withdrawal symptoms tend to occur within 48 hours following cessation of regular cannabis use, and include increased irritability, anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, sleep difficulties and aggression. Symptoms subside within 2 to 12 weeks. Driving under the influence of cannabis doubles the risk of causing a fatal road accident. Alcohol consumption plays an even greater role. A few studies and a number of isolated reports suggest that cannabis has a role in the occurrence of cardiovascular adverse effects, especially in patients with coronary heart disease. Numerous case-control studies have investigated the role of cannabis in the incidence of some types of cancer. Its role has not been ruled out, but it is not possible to determine whether the risk is distinct from that of the tobacco with which it is often smoked. Studies that have examined the influence of cannabis use on the clinical course of hepatitis C are inconclusive. Alcohol remains the main toxic agent that hepatitis C patients should avoid. In practice, the adverse effects of low-level, recreational cannabis use are generally minor, although they can apparently be serious in vulnerable individuals. The adverse effects of cannabis appear overall to be less serious than those of alcohol, in terms of neuropsychological and somatic effects, accidents and violence.;Cannabis/*adverse effects, Marijuana Abuse/*complications, Marijuana Smoking/*adverse effects, Adolescent, Cannabis/chemistry, Dronabinol/pharmacology, France/epidemiology, Humans, Time Factors, Young Adult",,0,1579
1580,Baclofen and severe alcohol dependence: an uncertain harm-benefit balance as of early 2013,"Alcohol dependence is a severe, chronic illness. Even the best-assessed drugs used to maintain abstinence are poorly effective. Some patients remain dependent after several treatment attempts. Baclofen has been tested for its capacity to reduce craving for alcohol. We reviewed the data available as of early 2013, using the standard Prescrire methodology, in order to assess the harm-benefit balance of baclofen in maintaining abstinence or moderation in alcohol-dependent patients. Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials conducted by the same team tested baclofen 30 mg/day in 123 alcohol-dependent patients referred to alcohol treatment centres. After 1 or 3 months of followup, more patients remained abstinent in the baclofen group than in the placebo group. In another double-blind, randomised trial, baclofen 30 mg/day was not more effective than placebo in 80 alcohol-dependent patients recruited through advertisements, many of whom were seeking treatment for the first time. Three uncontrolled retrospective series reported the results obtained in 300 alcohol-dependent patients, most of whom were in treatment failure. They were treated with high, escalating doses of baclofen (on average about 150 mg per day, up to 400 mg per day) with the intention of reducing their craving for alcohol. After 3 to 24 months of follow-up, about half of the patients reported moderate or zero alcohol consumption. At moderate doses, baclofen has been used since the 1970s in the treatment of certain forms of muscle spasticity. The main adverse effects reported in this setting were drowsiness (especially early during treatment) and various neuropsychiatric disorders such as dizziness, euphoria, depression, headache, paraesthesias, speech disorders, ataxia and insomnia. The adverse effects of high-dose baclofen are mainly based on monitoring of hundreds of alcohol-dependent patients, 69 reports to French pharmacovigilance centres in 2011, and cases of overdose or accidental ingestion reported to French poison control centres. Confusion and mania were reported, and coma occurred with doses of 200 mg or more. Some data point to an increased risk of suicide. In practice, in early 2013, more data are needed on the efficacy and adverse effects of baclofen in alcohol dependence, compared with other options. Patients who have received thorough, well-balanced information, and decide to try baclofen as a last resort should be included in comparative clinical studies.;Alcoholism/*drug therapy, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, GABA-B Receptor Agonists/*therapeutic use, Alcohol Drinking/prevention & control, Baclofen/administration & dosage, Baclofen/adverse effects, Clinical Trials as Topic, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, GABA-B Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage, GABA-B Receptor Agonists/adverse effects, Humans, Severity of Illness Index",,0,1580
1581,Naltrexone + bupropion (Mysimba) Too risky for only modest weight loss,"Weight loss and its long-term maintenance are mainly based on dietary measures and regular physical activity. There are currently no weight-loss medications with a favourable harm-benefit balance. Bupropion is chemically related to certain amphetamines, while naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist. A fixed-dose combination of these two drugs has received marketing authorisation in the European Union for obese patients and for over-weight patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. In five placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind trials, the patients, weighing on average between 100 kg and 105 kg (average body mass index 36 kg/m2), the naltrexone + bupropion combination was associated with an average weight loss of a few additional kilograms compared with placebo, after 6 months or one year of treatment. There are no post-trial follow-up data to show whether or not the patients regained their lost weight after treatment discontinuation. One trial including more than 8900 patients examined the effect of the naltrexone + bupropion combination on the freauency of maior cardiovascular events, but poor handling of an interim analysis undermined the validity of the final results. The known adverse effects of bupropion consist of potentially severe neuropsychiatric disorders such as aggressiveness, depression and suicidal ideation, and also allergic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Misuse and excessive consumption have been reported. In trials in obese or overweight patients, the naltrexone + bupropion combination caused sometimes severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including seizures, cognitive impairment, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disorders and psychotic symptoms. In clinical trials, the combination led to an increase in blood pressure compared with placebo, and also an excess of cardiac arrhythmias. About half of patients who took naltrexone + bupropion experienced gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and constipation. The naltrexone + bupropion combination is subject to many pharmacokinetic interactions, as well as pharmacodynamic interactions leading to additive convulsive or hypertensive effects, or undermining the action of antihypertensive drugs. A teratogenic effect of bupropion cannot be ruled out. In practice, given the limited effect of the naltrexone + bupropion combination on weight loss (a few kilograms), along with the lack of evidence supporting a persistent benefit or a decrease in the clinical complications of obesity, there is no reason to expose patients to its many potentially severe adverse effects.;Anti-Obesity Agents/*adverse effects, Bupropion/*adverse effects, Naltrexone/*adverse effects, Weight Loss/*drug effects, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Drug Combinations, Drug Interactions, Humans, Mental Disorders/chemically induced, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",,0,1581
1582,Varenicline: aggression and homicidal ideation,"Varenicline, a drug used for smoking cessation, carries a risk of neuropsychological adverse effects, including depression and suicide. Analysis of a series of detailed reports of aggression and homicidal ideation attributed to varenicline showed that most patients had no psychiatric history. These symptoms were often preceded by sleep disorders. Suicide and suicidal ideation were associated with signs of aggression in nearly one-third of cases. Aggressive symptoms recurred in patients who restarted varenicline. In practice, it is better to avoid using varenicline for smoking cessation and to use nicotine replacement instead when drug therapy is considered necessary.;Smoking Cessation*, Aggression/*drug effects, Benzazepines/*adverse effects, Nicotinic Agonists/*adverse effects, Quinoxalines/*adverse effects, Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Varenicline",,0,1582
